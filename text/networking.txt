HTTPS
How does HTTPS work?

Prerequisites
--------------
You need to trust that public key cryptography and signature works:
1. Any message encrypted with Bob's public key can only be decrypted with Bob's private key.
2. Anyone with access to Alice's public key can verify that a message (signature) could only have been created by someone with access to Alice's private key.

                      certificate that contains
                      public key, signed by Google CA.

                       using public key, encrypted
                       a new secret key with public key.

Bridge vs Switch
================
Bridge and switches are pretty similar, both operate at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
and both can filter data so that only the appropriate segment or host receives
a transmission.
Both filter packets based on the physical address (AKA: MAC = Media Access Control)
of the sender/receiver although newer switches sometimes inlclude the capabilities
of a router and can forward data based on IP address.
Switches are considered as superior devices than Bridges.
The major difference between a network bridge and switch are as follows:

Packet forwarding in Bridges   is performed using the software
                     Switches  is performed using HW.
Method of switching of a bridge is store and forward.
                         switch can be store, forward, cut through, of fragment-free.
A bridge has only 2 ports.
  switch can handle many ports.
  
Bridges divide collision domain into two parts. Bridges can create collision
domains but not broadcast domains.
