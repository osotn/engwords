Multilevel machines:

Level 0: Digital logic
Level 1: Microarchitecture level
Level 2: Instruction set architecture level
Level 3: OS
Level 4: Assembly language
Level 5: Problem - oriented language


0: Digital logic level
    Gates -> transistors.
    
    
Processors
==========
CPU = Central Processing Unit

3. The digital logic level
==========================

4. The microarchitecture level
==============================

Microarch will contain a microprogram (in ROM), whose job is to fetch, decode,
and execute IJVM instructions.

Each instructions at the ISA level is a function to be called by a master
program. Master program is a simple, endless loop that determines a function
to be invoked.

Microprogram has a set of varialbes, called the state of the computer.
    
5. The instruction set
   Architecture level
 ==========================

6. The Operating system
=======================

7. The assembly language level
==============================

Translator is called an assembler and the source language is called an assembly.

8. Parallel computer architectures
==================================
