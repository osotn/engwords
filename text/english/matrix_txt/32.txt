[00:00.000 --> 00:03.700]  All is vanity and chasing after wind.
[00:03.700 --> 00:05.600]  I said to myself,
[00:05.600 --> 00:12.600]  Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem.
[00:12.600 --> 00:18.200]  Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:18.200 --> 00:24.100]  I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly.
[00:24.100 --> 00:28.800]  I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.
[00:28.800 --> 00:37.200]  For in much wisdom is much grief, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
