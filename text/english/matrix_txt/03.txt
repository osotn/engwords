I'm ready, Johnny. Read your poem.
Yes, people, yes, it's true. I love that pretty, pretty Drew.
Yes, I love Drew. I love cinema, Shakespeare, pizza and my ma.
But Drew does not love me. She loves Pete and when I see her. I spit.
Spit, spit, spit, spit.
Poor boy. Your ma loves you, Johnny. Give her a kiss.
