[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  For everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven.
[00:06.240 --> 00:12.240]  A time to be born and a time to die. A time to kill and a time to heal.
[00:13.520 --> 00:20.400]  A time to break down and a time to build up. A time to weep and a time to laugh.
[00:21.760 --> 00:29.760]  A time to mourn and a time to dance. A time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together.
[00:30.800 --> 00:37.600]  A time to seek and a time to lose. A time to keep and a time to cast away.
[00:38.800 --> 00:45.040]  A time to tear and a time to sew. A time to keep silence and a time to speak.
[00:46.240 --> 00:53.520]  A time for war and a time for peace. A time to love and a time to hate.
[00:54.480 --> 01:00.160]  A time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together.
