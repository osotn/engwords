[00:00.000 --> 00:08.400]  Hamlet a poem by my son Johnny to be or not to be the silly silly bee
[00:09.840 --> 00:21.440]  to see or not to see or swim into the sea to eat or not to eat that juicy chunk of meat
[00:21.440 --> 00:32.720]  I'm Hamlet Prince of Danes I'm suffering from pains to talk or not to talk or go for a walk
[00:32.720 --> 00:42.880]  or hide under the bed the voices in my head I rhyme and then I scream or is it but a dream
[00:43.600 --> 00:51.920]  I'm Hamlet Prince I am I'm finished thank you mum oh that's beautiful you are a genius Johnny
[00:51.920 --> 01:04.800]  simply a genius
