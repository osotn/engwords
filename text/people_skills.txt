Chapter 2
Fundamental realities

We need to accept the self - importance or self - value that is build - in the
character of most of us. Of course, the degree of it varies in persons.

You must meet the needs of people to feel good about themselves.
How others view themselves after contacts with you is critical !!!
(And as strange as it might seem, this does not depend on how they regard you in
the usual way of analyzing persons).

It does not determine how people truly feel about you. What controls that is how
they evaluate you subliminally.
And this depends on how you make them feel about themselves after contact with
you. Your relations with these people must increase or improve their self -
importance or self - images.
