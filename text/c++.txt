The type of an object determines what opertors can be performed on it.
C++ is a statically typed language.

A reference defines an alternative name for an object.
&d - refers to
A reference is not an object. Instead, a reference is just another name for an already existing object.

A pointer is a compound type that "points to" another type.
Like references are used for indirect access to other objects.
Unlike references, a pointer is an object in its own right.

constexpr = const expression is an expression whose value cannot change and
that can be evaluated at compile time.

type alias = typedef

Decltype - returns the type of its operand.

std::vector is a collection of objects, all of which have the same type.
Every object in the collection has an associated index, which gives access to that object.
- container because it contains other objects.
- class template

iterators - all of the library containers have iterators,
Like pointers, iterators give us indirect access to an object.
Unlike pointers, we do not use the address of operator to obtain an iterator.
Instead, types that have iterators have members that return iterators.
These types have members named begin and end.
end - one past the end.
If the container is empty - begin == end
