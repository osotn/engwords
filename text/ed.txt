ed is a line editor for Unix OS.
ed influences on ex which in turn spawned vi.

The non-interactive Unix command grep was inspired by a common special use of ed,
where the command g/re/p performs a global regular expression search and prints the
line containing matches.

The Unix stream editor, sed implemented many of the scripting features fo ed.

ed - text editor
ed [ - ] [ -x ] [ name ]

The copy of the text being edited resides in a temporary file called the buffer.

Input mode = is accepting text, all input is merely collected.
Input mode is left by typing a period '.' alone at the beginning of a line.

A regular expression specifies a set of strings of characters.
        1. Any character, except a special character, matches itself.
           Special characters are the regular expression delimiter plush \[. and
           sometimes ^*S.
        2. A . matches any character.
        3. A \ followed by any character except a digit or () matches that character.
        4. A nonempty string s bracketed [s] (or [^s]) matches any character in (or not in) s.
           Substring a-b for inclusive range.
        5. A regular expression of form 1-4 followd by * matches a sequence of 0 or more matches
           of the regular expression.

Address:
        . = current line
        $ = last line of the buffer
        n = nth line of the buffer
        -5 +5 from the current line.

(.)a
<text>
.
The append command reads the given text and appends it after the addressed line.
