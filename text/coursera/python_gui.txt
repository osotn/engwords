An Introduction to Interactive Computing and Python
---------------------------------------------------

Game - rock, paper, scissors, lizard and Spock.

Programming is very hot field right now. Good programmers make six figure salaries.
This class and this specialization is dedicated to moving you toward a real career
in computer science.

Python is a programming language that is relatively easy to use and learn, but
it's still quite powerful.
Code Sculptor also allows us to build interactive programs. And it runs in the
browser.

Arithmetic expressions = numbers, operators, expressions.

Number:
    -   integer (or decimal);   int()
    -   float                   float()

Operators:
    +   plus        addition
    -   minus       subtraction
    *   times       multiplication
    /   divided by  division
    **  power       exponentiation

Very powerful construct in programming is the function.
Function is a piece of code that you define that you can execute later.

def triangle_area(base, height):       # head
    area = (1/2)*base*height           # body
    return area

In Python : character indicates that an indented block of code is about to begin.

If function doesn't have return value, then nothing coming back.
Python has a value none, and none means there's nothing there.


    //  integer divider
    %   remainder

import simplegui
import math
import random

math.pi
random.randrange(1,10)

True / False ->     class bool      ->  not, or, and

Comparison operators:
----------------------
    <   great then
    >   less  then
    <=  less or equal
    >=  great or equal
    ==  equal to
    !=  not equal to

if statement

if expression:
    body_if
elif expression:
    body_elif
else:
    body_else


Scissors    cuts        paper
Paper       covers      rock
rock        crushes     lizard
lizard      poisons     Spock
Spock       smashes     scissors
scissors    decapitates lizard
lizard      eats        paper
paper       disproves   Spock
Spock       vaporizes   rock
rock        crushes     scissors

rock - Spock - paper - lizard - scissors
