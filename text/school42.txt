UNIX filesystem lets us store files on our disk, our workspace
    - pwd
    - mkdir
    - rmdir
    - ls

    - hidden files in Unix start with a period (.)
    - . file and .. file - when system create two files
    
Files has own right:
    - access
    - writing
    - execution
There are three triplets:
    - for user itself
    - for his group
    - for rest of the world

    - u - user
    - g - group
    - o - other chmod o+r; chmod o-wx

    - cat - <-- input 
    - cat -e  <-- non printable characters and hard returns
Touch command - modify the last data of access and modification of a file

    - var=value
    - echo $var
    - export var
    - which cmd; type cmd
    - env - external variables
    - export var
    - unset var

    - wc filename
    - more filename
