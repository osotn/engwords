============

average speed (v) = distance (d) / time (t)

average and instantaneous speed

Displacement - vector quantity,  and distance - scalar quantity.

Speed and direction are combined in another quantity, called velocity.
Velocity is the rate of change of an object's displacement.

Accelerated motion

Force, mass and acceleration.

Force - Newtons
F = ma

Mass of an object is a measure of its inertia, or its ability to resist any change in its motion.
