Programmers may have the skills and can code like nobody else, but somehow
they can't secure the job or the promotion.
It's not programming ability they need now. It's soft skills holding
programmers back - from the job, the promotion, or even from satisfaction and
harmony at work.

Companies have started looking for professionals who don't just possess technical
expertise or development skills such as writing the code or executing tests, but
soft skills that will make them a part of the larger team.
For example, programmers must deal with their colleagues such as designers, QA,
engineers, project managers or associates or stakeholders.
A lot of budding engineers may feel fuzzy about the purpose of mastering soft
skills, but actually, they make you a good leader and effective communicator
among your peers.
Software development is all about teamwork and your team can succeed only when
there is appropriate collaboration, communication, a common objective, joint
effort.

Effective communication is the key to success.
This soft skill makes programmers among the most successful, but it is not just
limited to software developers. Communication is a two-way street, requiring

who just talk.
