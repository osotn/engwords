ESC/P = Epson Standard Code for Printers is a printer control language developed by Epson
to control computer printers.
It was mainly used in dot matrix printers and some inkjet printers, and is stil widely
used in many receipt thermal printers.

Escape sequences used, which start with the escape character ESC (ASCII code 27).

ESC/POS is a variant for controlling receipt printers as commonly used at the point of sale (POS).

CUPS = Common UNIX Printing System is a modular printing system for Unix-like computer OS
which allows a computer to act as a print server.
A computer running CUPS is a host that can accept print jobs from client computers, process them,
and send them to the appropriate printer.
CUPS consists of a print spooler (between a computer application and a slow peripheral, such as a printer).
and scheduler, a filter system that converts the print data to a format that the printer will understand,
and a backend system that sends this data to the printer device.
CUPS uses the IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) as the basic for managing print jobs and queues.
It also provides the traditional command line interfaces.
PPD = PostScript Printer Description (Adobe's) - config device driver for CUPS.

Print data goes to a scheduler which sends jobs to a filter system that converts the print job into
a format the printer will understand. The filter system then passes the data on to a backend -
a special filter that sends print data to a device or network connection.


CUPS:
  log     - /var/log/cups/error_log
  config  - /etc/cups/cupsd.conf <--- change level of messages on debug or debug2



Scheduler - IPP/HTTP protocol

Filtering process:
 - raster to PCL
 - raster to ESC/P
