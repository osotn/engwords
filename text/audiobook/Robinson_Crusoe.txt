Robinson Crusoe
by Daniel Defoe

Chapter 1
My first sea journey

Before I begin my story, I would like to tell you a little about myself.
I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York in the north of England.
My father was German, but he came to live and work in England. Soon after that,
he married my mother, who was English. Her family name was Robinson, so, when
I was born, they called me Robinson, after her.
My father did well in his business and I went to a good school. He wanted me
to get job and live a quiet, comfortable life. But I didn't want that.
I wanted adventure and an exciting life.
' I want to be a sailor and go to sea,' I told my mother and father.
They were very unhappy about this.
' Please don't go ', my father said. ' You won't be happy, you know. Sailors have
a difficult and dangerous life '. And because I loved him, and he was unhappy,
I tried to forget about the sea.
But I couldn't forget, and about a year later, I saw a friend in town. His father
had a ship, and my friend said to me. ' We're sailing to London tomorrow. Why
don't you come with us?'
