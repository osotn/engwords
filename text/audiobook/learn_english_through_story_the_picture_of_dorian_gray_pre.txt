chapter one the room was filled with the

smell of roses sitting on a sofa smoking

a cigarette was Lord Henry Wotton

through the open door came the distant

sounds of the London streets in the

center of the room stood a portrait of

an extraordinarily beautiful young man

sitting a little distance in front of it

was the artist himself basil Hallward as

the painter looked at the portrait he

smiled it is your best work basil the

best thing you have ever done said Lord

Henry slowly you really must send it

next year to the Grosvenor the Grosvenor

is really the only place to exhibit her

painting like that I don't think I shall

send it anywhere the painter answered

moving his head in that odd way that

used to make his friends laugh at him at

Oxford University no I won't send it

anywhere Lord Henry looked at him in

surprise through the thin blue smoke of

his cigarette not send it anywhere My

dear man why not

what odd people you painters are I know

you will laugh at me

basil replied but I really can't exhibit

it I have put too much of myself into it

Lord Henry's stretched himself out on

the sofa and laughed too much of

yourself in it basil this man is truly

beautiful he does not look like you you

don't understand me Harry answered the

artist of course I am NOT like him I

would be sorry to look like him it is

better not to be different from other

people

the stupid and ugly have the best of

this world Dorian Gray Dorian Gray is

that his name asked Lord Henry walking

across the room towards basil Hallward

yes that is his name I wasn't going to

tell you but why not oh I can't explain

when I like people enormous ly I never

tell their names to anyone I suppose you

think that's very foolish

not at all answered Lord Henry not at

all my dear basil you forget that I am

married so my life is full of secrets I

never know where my wife is and my wife

never knows what I am doing when we meet

we tell each other lies with the most

serious faces I hate the way you talk

about your married life Harry said basil

hold walking towards the doors that led

into the garden I believe you are really

a very good husband but that you are

ashamed of it

you never say a good thing and you never

do a wrong thing Lord Henry laughed and

the two men went out into the garden

together after a pause Lord Henry pulled

out his watch I am afraid I have to go

basil he said in a quiet voice but

before I go I want you to explain to me

why you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's

picture I want the real reason I told

you the real reason no you did not you

said that it was because there was too

much of yourself in it now that is

childish Harry said basil Hallward

looking him straight in the face every

portrait that is painted with feeling is

a portrait of the artist not the sitter

I will not exhibit this picture because

I am afraid that I have shown in it the

secret of my own soul Lord Henry laughed

and what is that he asked oh there is

really very little to tell Harry

answered the painter and I don't think

you will understand perhaps

you won't believe it Lord Henry smiled

and picked a flower from the grass I am

quite sure I'll understand it he replied

staring at the flower and I can believe

anything the story is simply this said

the painter two months ago I went to a

party at lady Brandon's after I had been

in the room for about ten minutes

I suddenly realized that someone was

looking at me I turned around and saw

Dorian Gray for the first time when our

eyes met I felt the blood leaving my

face I knew that this boy would become

my whole soul my whole art itself what

did you do we were quite close almost

touching our eyes met again

I asked lady Brandon to introduce me to

him what did lady Brandon say about mr.

Dorian Gray Oh something like charming

boy I don't know what he does I think he

doesn't do anything oh yes he plays the

piano or is it the violin dear mr. gray

Dorian died both laughed and we became

friends at once laughter is not at all a

bad beginning for a friendship said the

young lord picking another flower and it

is the best ending for one Hall would

shook his head you don't understand what

friendship is Harry everyone is the same

to you that's not true cried Lord Henry

pushing his hat back and looking at the

summer sky I choose my friends for their

beauty and my enemies for their

intelligence a man cannot be too careful

in choosing his enemies of course I hate

my relations and I hate poor people

because they are ugly stupid and drunk I

don't agree with a word you have said

and I feel sure that you don't agree

either

Lord Henry touched his pointed brown

beard with his finger and the toe of his

boot with his stick how English you are

basil an Englishman is only interested

in whether he agrees with an idea not

whether it is right or wrong but tell me

more about mr. Dorian Gray how often do

you see him every day I couldn't be

happy if I didn't see him every day how

extraordinary

I thought you only cared about your art

he is all my art to me now said the

painter I know that the work I have done

since I met Dorian Gray is the best work

of my life in some strange way his

personality has shown me a new kind of

art he seems like a little boy though he

is really more than twenty and when he

is with me I see the world differently

basil this is extraordinary

I must see Dorian Gray whole wood got up

from his seat and walked up and down the

garden after some time he came back

Harry

he said Dorian Gray is the reason for my

art you might see nothing in him

I see everything in him then why won't

you exhibit his portrait asked Lord

Henry an artist should paint beautiful

things but he should put nothing of his

own life into them some day I will show

the world what that beauty is for that

reason the world will never see my

portrait of Dorian Gray I think you are

wrong basil but I won't argue with you

Tony

his Dorian Gray very fond of you

the painter thought for a few moments he

likes me he answered after a pause I

know he likes me of course I flatter him

too much and tell him things that I

not he is usually very charming to me

and we spend thousands of wonderful

hours together but sometimes he can be

horribly thoughtless and seems to enjoy

causing me pain then I feel Harry

that I have given my whole soul to

someone who uses it like a flower to put

in his coat on a summer's day summer

days are long basil said Lord Henry in a

quiet voice perhaps you will get bored

before he will intelligence lives longer

than beauty one day you will look at

your friend and you won't like his color

or something and then you will begin to

think that he has behaved badly towards

you Harry don't talk like that

as long as I live Dorian Gray will be

everything to me you can't feel what I

feel you change too often I dear basil

that is exactly why I can feel it Lord

Henry took a cigarette from his pretty

silver box and lit it then he turned to

Hallward and said I have just remembered

remembered what Harry where I heard the

name of Dorian Gray

where was it asked Hallward with a frown

don't look so angry basil it was at my

aunt's lady Agatha's she told me that

she had discovered this wonderful young

man he was going to help her work with

the poor people in the East End of

London and his name was Dorian Gray of

course I didn't know it was your friend

I am very glad you didn't Harry why I

don't want you to meet him

a servant came into the garden mr.

Dorian Gray is waiting in the house sir

he said Hugh must introduce me now cried

Lord Henry laughing the painter turned

to his servant ask mr. gray to wait

Parker I will come in in a few moments

then he looked at Lord Henry Dorian Gray

is my dearest friend he said he is a

beautiful person don't spoil him don't

try and influence him your influence

would be bad don't take away from me the

one person who makes me a true artist

what silly things you say said Lord

Henry smiling he took Hallward by the

arm and almost led him into the house

chapter 2 as they entered they saw

Dorian Gray he was sitting at the piano

with his back to them and he was turning

the pages of some music by Schumann you

must lend me these basil he cried I want

to learn them they are perfectly

charming

perhaps if you sit well for me today

Dorian oh I am bored with sitting and I

don't want a portrait of myself answered

the boy turning quickly when he saw Lord

Henry his face went red for a moment

I am sorry basil I didn't know that you

had anyone with you this is Lord Henry

Wotton Dorian he's an old friend of mine

we went to Oxford together I have just

been telling him what a good city you

were and now you have spoiled everything

you have not spoiled my pleasure in

meeting you mr. gray said Lord Henry

stepping forward and offering his hand

my arms has often spoken to me about you

I am afraid

lady agatha is annoyed with me at the

moment i promised to go to a club in

Whitechapel with her last tuesday and i

forgot all about it

I don't know what she will say to me

Lord Henry looked at him yes

he was certainly wonderfully handsome

with his curved red lips honest blue

eyes and gold hair oh don't worry about

my aunt you are one of her favorite

people and you are too charming to waste

time working for poor people

Lord Henry sat down on the sofa and

opened his cigarette box the painter was

busy mixing colors and getting his

brushes ready suddenly he looked at Lord

Henry and said Harry I want to finish

this pictures a day would you think it

very rude of me if I asked you to go

away Lord Henry smiled and looked at

Dorian Gray

shall I go mr. gray he asked oh please

don't Lord Henry I see that basil is in

one of his difficult moods and I hate it

when he is difficult and I want you to

tell me why I should not help the poor

people that would be very boring mr.

gray but I certainly will not run away

if you do not want me to is that all

right basil you have often told me that

you liked your sitters to have someone

to talk to

Allwood bit his lip if that is what

Dorian wants Dorian always gets what he

wants

Lord Henry picked up his hat and gloves

no I am afraid I must go goodbye mr.

grey come and see me one afternoon in

Curzon Street I am nearly always at home

at five o'clock

basil cried Dorian Gray if Lord Henry

Wotton goes I will go too you never open

your lips while you were painting and it

is horribly boring just standing here

ask him to stay

all right please stay Harry for Dorian

and for me said Hallward staring at his

picture it is true that I never talk

when I am working and never listen

either it must be very boring for my

sitters sit down again Harry and Dorian

don't move about too much or listen to

what Lord Henry says he has a very bad

influence over all his friends Dorian

Gray stood while Hallward finished his

portrait he liked what he had seen of

Lord Henry he was so different to basil

and he had such a beautiful voice after

a few moments he said to him have you

really a very bad influence Lord Henry

as bad as basil says influence is always

bad

why because to influence someone is to

give them your soul each person must

have his own personality turn your head

a little more to the right Dorian said

the painter he was not listening to the

conversation and only knew that there

was a new look on the boy's face and yet

continued Lord Henry in his low musical

voice I believe that if one man lived

his life fully and completely he could

change the world he would be a work of

art greater than anything we have ever

imagined but the bravest man among us is

afraid of himself you mr. grey are very

young but you have had passions that

have made you afraid dreams stop cried

Dorian Gray I don't understand what

you're saying I need to think for nearly

ten minutes he stood there with his lips

open and his eyes strangely bright the

words that Basil's friend had spoken had

touched his soul yes there had been

things in his boyhood that he had not

understood

he

them now with his smile

Lord Henry watched him he knew the exact

moment when to say nothing he was

surprised at the sudden effect of his

words on the boy how fascinating the boy

was all wood continued painting and did

not notice that the others were silent

basil I am tired cried Dorian Gray

suddenly I must go and sit in the garden

there is no air in here My dear boy I am

sorry when I'm painting my work is all I

can think about but you never sat better

I don't know what Harry has been saying

to you but there is a wonderful bright

look in your eyes I suppose he has been

flattering you you shouldn't believe a

word he says he has certainly not been

flattering me perhaps that is why I

don't believe anything he has told me

you know you believe it all said Lord

Henry looking at him with his dreamy

eyes I will go out to the garden with

you it's horribly hot in this room don't

keep Dorian too long said the painter

this is going to be my best painting

Lord Henry went out to the garden and

found Dorian Gray holding a flower to

his face he came close to him and put

his hand on his shoulder Dorian Gray

frowned and turned away he liked the

tall young man who was standing by him

his dark romantic face interested him

there was something in his low musical

voice that was fascinating but he felt a

little afraid why was this stranger

having a strong influence on him like

this he had known basil Hallward for

months but the friendship between them

had not changed him suddenly someone had

come into his life and turned it upside

down someone who seemed to have the key

to the mystery of life itself

and yet what was there to be afraid of

he was not a school boy or a girl it was

silly to be afraid let us go and sit out

of the Sun I don't want you to be burnt

by the Sun what does that matter cried

Dorian Gray laughing as he sat down on

the seat at the end of the garden it

should matter very much to you a mr.

gray why because you are young and to be

young is the best thing in the world I

don't feel that Lord Henry no you don't

feel it now someday when you are old and

ugly

you will feel it terribly now wherever

you go you charm the world will it

always be so you have a wonderfully

beautiful face mr. gray

I don't think don't frown it is true the

gods have been good to you but what the

gods give they quickly take away you

have only a few years in which to really

live perfectly and fully live your life

now while you are still young suddenly

the painter appeared at the door and

waved at them to come in they turned to

each other and smiled

I am waiting you cried please come in

the light is perfect they got up and

walked towards the house together you

are glad you have met me mr. gray said

Lord Henry looking at him yes I am glad

now I wonder whether I will always be

glad always that is a terrible word

women are so fond of using it twenty

minutes later

Allwood stopped painting he stood back

and looked at the portrait for a few

moments then he bent down and signed his

name in red paint on the bottom

left-hand corner

it is finished he cried Lord Henry came

over and examined the picture it was

certainly a wonderful work of art my

dear man he said it is the best portrait

of our time mr. gray come over and look

at yourself

Dorian walked across to look at the

painting when he saw it his cheeks went

red with pleasure

he felt that he recognized his own

beauty for the first time but then he

remembered what Lord Henry had said his

beauty would only be there for a few

years one day he would be old and ugly

don't you like it cried Hallward not

understanding why the boy was silent of

course he likes it

said Lord Henry it is one of the

greatest paintings in modern art I will

pay anything you ask for it I must have

it it is not mine to sell Harry whose is

it

Dorian's of course answered the painter

he is very lucky how sad it is said

Dorian Gray who was still staring at his

own portrait I will grow old and

horrible but this painting will always

stay young it will never be older than

this day in June if I really hit with

the other way what do you mean asked

Hall would if I could say young and the

picture grow old for that for that I

would give everything yes there is

nothing in the whole world I would not

give I would give my soul for that I

don't think you would like that basil

cried Lord Henry laughing I certainly

would not Harry said Hallward Dorian

Gray turned and looked at him you like

your art better than your friends the

painters

stared in surprise why was Dorian

speaking like that what had happened his

face was red and he seemed quite angry

you will always like this painting but

how long will you like me until I start

getting old Lord Henry Wotton is

perfectly right when I lose my beauty I

will lose everything I shall kill myself

before I get old Hallward turned white

and caught his hand Dorian Dorian he

cried don't talk like that I have never

had a friend like you and I will never

have another how can you be jealous of a

painting you are more beautiful than any

work of art I am jealous of everything

whose beauty does not die I am jealous

of the portrait you have painted of me

why should it keep what I must lose hot

tears came into his eyes as he threw

himself on the sofa you did this Harry

said the painter angrily Lord Henry

shook his head

it is the real Dorian Gray that is all

Harry I can't argue with two of my best

friends at once between you both you

have made me hate the best piece of work

I have ever done I will destroy it

Dorian Gray watched as Hallward walked

over to the painting table and picked up

a knife the boy jumped from the sofa

tore the knife from hallward's hand and

threw it across the room tones basil he

cried don't murder it I am glad that you

like my work at last Dorian said the

painter coldly I never thought you would

like it I am in love with it basil it is

part of myself I feel that what silly

people you are both of you said Lord

Henry

let's forget

the painting for one night and go to the

theater I would like to come to the

theater with you

Lord Henry and you will come to want you

basil

I can't said Hallward I have too much

work to do well you and I will go

together mr. gray

the painter bit his lip and walked over

to the picture I will stay with the real

Dorian he said sadly Chapter three

one afternoon a month later Dorian Gray

was sitting in the little library of

Lord Henry's house in Mayfair Lord Henry

had not yet come in he was always late

Dorian Gray was bored and once or twice

he thought of going away at last he

heard a step outside and the door opened

how late you are Harry he said I am

afraid it is not Harry mr. gray it is

only his wife he looked around quickly

and got to his feet I am sorry I thought

I know you quite well by your

photographs I think my husband has got

seventeen of them

seventeen lady Henry well eighteen then

and I saw you with him the other night

at the theatre but here is Harry Lord

Henry smiled at them both so sorry I am

late

dorium I'm afraid I must go said Lady

Harry goodbye mr. grey goodbye Harry you

are eating out I suppose I am too

perhaps I'll see you later perhaps My

dear said Lord Harry shutting the door

behind her then he lit a cigarette and

threw himself down on the sofa never

marry a woman with fair hair Dorian he's

by Harry because they are romantic but I

like romantic people never marry at all

Dorian I don't think I will marry Harry

I am too much in love who were you in

love with asked Lord Henry after a pause

with an actress said Dorian Gray how

ordinary you would not say that if you

saw her Harry who is she her name is

Sibyl vane I've never heard of her

no one has people will were Sunday

though she is an artist My dear boy no

woman is an artist women never have

anything to say that they say it

charmingly how long have you known now

about three weeks and where did you meet

her I will tell you Harry but you must

not laugh after all it was you who gave

me a passion to know everything about

life four days after I met you I

searched the streets for beauty I walked

around the East End until I found a

dirty little theatre I see you are

laughing

it is horrible of you I am NOT laughing

Dorian go on with your story

the play was Romeo and Juliet at first I

was annoyed at the thought of seeing

Shakespeare in such a terrible place and

when a fat old gentleman came out as

Romeo I nearly walked out but then I saw

Juliet Harry she was the loveliest thing

I had ever seen in my life when did you

meet her I went back

the next night and the night after that

on the third evening I waited for her

outside the theater what was she like

Sybil

oh she was shy and gentle she is only 17

and there was something of a child in

her she said to me you look like a

prince I must call you Prince Charming

his Sybil knows how to flatter you you

don't understand her Harry she thinks

that I am like a person in Shakespeare

she knows nothing of life Sibyl is the

only thing I care about that is the

reason I suppose that you never have

dinner with me now I thought it might be

something romantic dear Harry we eat

together every day said Dorian you

always come very late well I have to see

Sibyl play he cried can you have dinner

with me tonight Dorian he shook his head

tonight she is a failure he answered and

tomorrow night she will be Juliet when

is she's Sybil vane never that's good

how horrible you are but when you see

her you will think differently I want

you in basil to come and watch her

tomorrow night you are certain to

recognize that she is wonderful alright

tomorrow evening will you see basil

before then or shall I write to him dear

basil I haven't seen him for a week it

is rather horrible of me as he sent me

my portrait a few days ago I loved

looking at it

perhaps you should write to him I don't

want to see him alone he says things

that annoy me he gives me good advice

Lord Henry smiled people are very fond

of giving away advice they need

themselves Oh basil is a good man but I

don't think he really understands about

art and beauty since I have no new Harry

I have to

covered that Mazal my dear boy puts

everything that is charming in him into

his work I must go now hurry my Juliet

is waiting for me don't forget about

tomorrow good bye as Dorian left the

room

Lord Henry began to think about what he

had just learned certainly few people

had ever interested him so much as

Dorian Gray yet the mad worship of this

actress did not make him annoyed or

jealous he was pleased by it it made the

boy more interesting to study later that

night when he arrived home from dinner

Lord Henry saw a telegram on the table

near the door he opened it and read the

Dorian Gray was going to marry Sibyl

vane chapter 4 I suppose

heard the news basil said Lord Henry the

following evening they were in the

dining room of the Bristol Hotel no

Harry answered the artist giving his hat

and coat to the waiter what is it

Dorian Gray is going to be married said

Lord Henry watching him as he spoke

Allwood frowned Thorian going to be

married he cried impossible it is

perfectly true to whom to some little

actress but it would be absurd for him

to marry someone like that if you want

to make him marry this girl tell him

that basil he is sure to do it then

whenever a man does a completely stupid

thing it is always for a good reason

I hope this girl is good Harry

oh she is better than good she is

beautiful said Lord Henry Dorian says

that she is beautiful and he is not

often wrong about these things your

portrait has helped him understand

beauty in others we are to see her

tonight if that boy doesn't forget but

how can Dorian marry an actress Harry it

is absurd right the painter walking up

and down the room biting his lip Dorian

Gray falls in love with a beautiful

actress who plays Juliet he asks her to

marry him why not I hope that Dorian

Gray marries this girl and worships her

for six months then he can suddenly

become fascinated by another one you

don't mean a word of that Harry I know

you don't really want Dorian Gray's life

to be spoiled you are much better than

you pretend to be Lord Henry laughed the

reason we all like to think so well of

others is because we are afraid for

ourselves but here is Dorian himself he

will tell you more than I can I dear

Harry

My dear basil you must both congratulate

me said the boy throwing off his coat

and shaking each of his friends hands I

have never been so happy of course it is

sudden all the best things are and yet

it seems to me to be the one thing I

have been looking for all my life

I hope you will always be very happy

Dorian said hallward but why did you not

tell me you told Harry there really is

not much to tell

cried Dorian last night I went to see

her again after when we were sitting

together they came into her eyes a

wonderful look it was something I had

never seen there before we kissed each

other I can't describe to you what I

felt at that moment have you seen her

today asked Lord Henry Dorian Gray shook

his head I have left her in

Shakespeare's forest I will find her in

his garden at what exact point did you

use the word mary dorian and how did she

answer perhaps you forgot all about it

My dear Harry it was not a business

meeting I told her I loved her the whole

world is nothing to me compared to her

but my dear Dorian all would put his

hand on Lord Henry's arm don't Harry you

have annoyed Dorian he is not like other

men he would never harm anyone Lord

Henry looked across the table Dorian is

never annoyed with me he answered Dorian

Gray laughed when I am with Sibyl vane I

don't believe in anything you have

taught me I forget all your fascinating

terrible ideas and those are asked Lord

Henry helping himself to some salad

Oh your ideas about life your ideas

about love your ideas about pleasure

all your

Diaz hurry pleasure is the only thing

worth having ideas about he answered in

his slow musical voice when we are happy

we are always good but when we are good

we are not always happy I know what

pleasure is cried Dorian Gray it is to

worship someone that is certainly better

than when someone worships you Harry you

are terrible I don't know why I like you

so much let us go down to the theater

when you see Sibyl you will change your

ideas they got up and put on their coats

the painter was silent and thoughtful he

felt very sad Dorian Gray would never

again be to him all that he had been in

the past life had come between them when

he arrived at the theatre it seemed to

Hallward that he had grown years older

chapter 5 the theater was crowded that

night it was terribly hot and there were

young people shouting to each other from

across seats women were laughing loudly

and their voices sounded horrible people

were eating oranges and drinking from

bottles what a place to find the perfect

girl in said Lord Henry chess answered

Dorian Gray it was here I found her when

you see her as Juliet you will forget

everything these ugly people become

quite different when she appears I

understand what you mean Dorian said the

painter and I believe in this girl

anyone you love must be wonderful thanks

basil answered Dorian Gray I knew that

you would understand me in a few minutes

you will see the girl who I am going to

give my life to the girl who I have

given everything that is good in me

then Sybil appeared the crowd shouted

and called her name yes she was

certainly lovely to look at

Lord Henry thought basil Hallward jumped

to his feet excitedly Dorian Gray sat

staring at her like he was in a dream

charming charming cried Lord Henry a

quarter of an hour later

Lord Henry whispered to Hallward she is

one of the loveliest girls I have ever

seen but she is a terrible actress

Dorian Gray's face turned white as he

watched her speak she was so different

tonight now she was not Juliet but a

very bad actress who did not understand

Shakespeare's words even the crowd

became bored and began to talk loudly

the only person who did not seem to

notice was the actress herself

Lord Henry got up from his chair and put

on his coat

she is beautiful Dorian he said but she

can't act let's go I am going to stay

until the end answered the boy in a cold

voice I am awfully sorry that I have

made you waste an evening Harry I

apologize to you both I dear Dorian

perhaps miss vane is ill said Hallward

we will come some other night come to

the club with basil and myself we will

smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty

of Sibyl vane she is beautiful

what more do you want go away Harry

cried the boy I want to be alone can't

you see my heart is breaking what tears

came to his eyes as Lord Henry and

Hallward left the theater when it was

over Dorian Gray rushed to see Sibyl

vane the girl was standing there alone

with a look of extraordinary happiness

on her face how badly I acted tonight

Dorian she cried horribly

he answered staring at her it was

terrible Are you ill why did you make me

suffer like that the girl smiled Dorian

don't you understand understand what he

asked angrily why I was so bad tonight

why I will always be bad why I will

never act well again you are ill I

suppose when you are ill you shouldn't

act my friends were bored I was bored

Dorian Dorian she cried before I knew

you acting was the one important thing

in my life it was only in the theatre

that I lived I thought that it was all

true tonight for the first time in my

life I saw that I was playing at love

our love for each other is the only true

love take me away with you Dorian I

don't want to be an actress anymore he

threw himself down on the sofa and

turned away his face you have killed my

love he said quietly then he jumped up

and went to the door my god how mad I

was to love you what a fool I have been

you are nothing to me now I will never

see you again

I will never think of you I will never

speak to you again the girl went white

you are not serious Dorian you are

acting she whispered putting her hand on

his arm he pushed her back

don't touch me he cried when he turned

and left the room after walking the

streets of London all night he arrived

home just after sunrise as he passed

through the library

he saw the portrait that basil Hallward

had painted off him he stared at it in

surprise and walked on into his bedroom

he took his coat off and stood next to

his bed a few moments later he returned

to the picture and looked at it closely

in the poor light the face seemed to

have changed a little

now the mouth looked cruel

it was certainly strange he walked to

the window and opened the curtains the

light changed the room but the face

stayed the same

in fact the sunlight made the mouth look

even crueler going back to his bedroom

he found a small mirror that had been a

present from Lord Henry he looked at his

real face and saw no sign of cruelty

what did it mean he threw himself into a

chair and began to think suddenly he

remembered what he had said in basil

hallward's house the day the picture had

been finished yes he remembered it

perfectly he had asked that the painting

grow old so that he himself could remain

young but such things were impossible it

was terrible even to think about them

and yet there was the picture in front

of him there was the cruelty in the

mouth cruelty had he been cruel no

think about Sybil vane she was nothing

to him now but the picture what was he

to say of that it held the secret of his

life and told his story it had taught

him to love his own beauty would it

teach him to hate his own soul would he

ever look at it again he would save

himself he would not see Lord Henry

again he would go back to Sibyl vane

marry her and try to love her again she

had suffered more than he had poor child

he had been selfish and cruel to her

they would be happy together his life

with her would be beautiful and pure he

got up from his chair and covered the

portrait how horrible he said to himself

and he walked across to the window and

opened it when he stepped out onto the

grass he took a deep breath he thought

only of Sibyl the birds that were

singing in the garden seemed to be

telling the flowers about her chapter 6

it was nearly one o'clock the

afternoon when he woke up his servant

brought him a cup of tea and some

letters one of them was from Lord Henry

and had been brought by hand that

morning he put it to one side he went

into the library for breakfast feeling

perfectly happy then he saw the open

window and a covered portrait was it all

true or had it just been a dream but he

remembered that cruel mouth so clearly

Dorian Gray sent his servant away and

locked all the doors then he pulled the

cover off the painting and saw himself

face to face it was true the portrait

had changed for hours he did not know

what to do or think finally he went over

to the table and wrote a passionate

letter to the girl he had loved he asked

her to forgive him for the terrible

things he had said to her suddenly he

heard a knock on the door and he heard

Lord Henry's voice outside My dear boy I

must see you let me in at once he made

no answer but remained quite still the

knocking continued and grew louder yes

it was better to let Lord Henry in he

would explain to him the new life he was

going to lead he jumped up covered the

picture and opened the door I am sorry

about it all Dorian said Lord Henry as

he entered but you must not think too

much about it

do you mean about Sibyl vane asked the

boy yes of course answered Lord Henry

sitting down and slowly pulling off his

yellow gloves it is terrible but you are

not to blame tell me did you go behind

and see her after it was over yes

I felt sure that you had did you have an

argument I was cruel Harry terribly

cruel but it is all right now I am not

sorry for anything that has happened it

has taught me to know myself better Oh

Dorian I am so glad that you see it that

way I want to be good Harry I don't want

my soul to be ugly I am going to marry

Sibyl vane marries Sibyl vane cried Lord

Henry standing up and staring at him in

surprise but my dear Dorian yes Harry

I know what you are going to say

something horrible about getting married

don't say it Sibyl will be my wife your

wife

Dorian didn't you get my letter

I wrote to you this morning your letter

oh yes I remember I have not read it yet

Harry you know nothing yet then what do

you mean

Lord Henry walked across the room and

sat down next to Dorian Gray taking both

his hands in his own he held them Dorian

he said my letter was to tell you that

Sibyl vane is dead a cry of pain came

from the boy's lips and he jumped to his

feet dead Sibyl dead it is not true it

is a horrible lie it is true Dorian said

Lord Henry it is in all the morning

newspapers the police will be asking

questions and you must keep your name

out of any scandal things like that make

a man fashionable in Paris but in London

they are a disaster for any gentleman I

suppose they don't know your name at the

theater if they don't it is alright did

anyone see you going round to her room

Dorian did not answer for a few moments

finally he said in a strange voice Harry

did you say that the police are asking

questions what did you mean by that

did Sibyl Oh Harry

this is terrible I am sure that it was

not an accident

though it must be described that way

officially she swallowed something

horrible they use at theatres Harry

Harry it is terrible cried the boy yes

it is very sad of course but it is

nothing to do with you come with me to

dinner and after we will go to the

theatre so I have murdered Sibyl vane

said Dorian Gray after himself yet the

roses are not less lovely the birds

still sing happily in my garden and

tonight I will have dinner with you and

go to the theatre how extraordinary life

is my first passionate love letter was

to a dead girl yet why is it that I

cannot feel this tragedy as much as I

want to I don't think I am heartless to

you you have done too many foolish

things in the last fortnight to be

heartless Dorian answered Lord Henry

with his sweet sad smile the boy frowned

I don't like

that explanation Harry he said but I am

glad you don't think I am heartless a

woman has killed herself for the love of

you said Lord Henry that is very

beautiful they were silent the evening

darkened in the room after some time

Dorian Gray looked up how well do you

know me but we will not talk again of

what has happened it has been something

wonderful that is all now I have to

dress Harry I feel too tired to eat

anything but I will join you later at

the theater as Lord Henry closed the

door behind him

Dorian rushed to the portrait and tore

off the cover no there was no further

change in the picture it had received

the news of Sibyl vanes death before he

had known of it himself tears came to

his eyes as he remembered her he brushed

them away and looked again at the

picture he felt the time had come to

choose or had he already chosen yes life

had decided that for him the portrait

was going to carry his shame that was

all an hour later he was at the theatre

and Lord Henry was sitting beside him

Chapter seven as he was eating breakfast

the next morning basil Hallward was

shown into the room I am so glad I have

found you Dorian he said I called last

night and they told me that you were at

the theater of course I knew that was

impossible I had a terrible evening

worrying whether one tragedy would be

followed by another I can't tell you how

heartbroken I am about the whole thing

did you go and see the girls mother what

did she say about it all my idea basil I

don't know said Dorian Gray he looked

very bored I was at the theater you went

to the theater said Hallward speaking

very slowly you went to the theater

where Sibyl vane was lying dead stop

basil I won't hear it cried Dorian

jumping to his feet you must not speak

of such things what is done is done

what is past is past you call yesterday

the past

Dorian this is horrible something has

changed you completely you look exactly

the same as the wonderful boy in my

picture but now there is no heart in you

it is all Harry's influence I see that

the boy went to the window and looked

out at the garden for a few moments

Harry has taught me many things basil he

said at last you have only taught me to

love my own beauty I am truly sorry for

that Dorian I don't know what you mean

basil he said turning around I don't

know what you want what do you want I

want the Dorian Gray I used to paint

said the artist sadly

or said the boy going over to him and

putting his hand on his shoulder you

have come too late yesterday when I

heard that Sibyl vane had killed herself

killed herself my god

is the no doubt about that right halt

would I dear Bassel of course she killed

herself

the older man put his face in his hands

huh

terrible he said in a quiet voice no

said Dorian Gray

there is nothing terrible about it it is

one of the great romantic tragedies of

our time I know you are surprised at me

talking to you like this you have not

realized how I have changed I was a boy

when you knew me I am a man now I have

new passions new thoughts new ideas but

Dorian I am different but you must not

like me less of course I am very fond of

Harry but I know that you are better

than he is you are not stronger you are

too afraid of life but you are better

and how happy we used to be together

don't leave me basil and don't argue

with me I am what I am

the painter

strangely sad Dorian Gray was

extraordinarily important to him

the boy had changed his art perhaps his

cruel talk about Sibyl vane was just a

mood that would pass away there was so

much in him that was good

well Dorian he said with the sad smile I

won't speak to you again about this

horrible thing I only hope that your

name is kept out of any scandal have the

police asked to see you Dorian shook his

head

they don't even know my name he answered

she didn't know your name

only my first name and I'm sure that she

did not tell it to anyone she told her

family that I was Prince Charming

it was pretty of her you must do me a

drawing of Sibyl basil I would like to

have something more of her than the

memory of a few kisses I will try and do

something Dorian but you must come and

sit for me again

I can't work so well without you I can

never sit for you again basil it is

impossible he cried My dear boy what is

this foolishness

Allwood cried did you not like what I

did for you where is it why have you

covered it let me look at it it is the

best thing I have ever done it is very

bad of your servant to hide my work like

that I felt the room looked different as

I came in it was not my servant who

covered it basil I did it myself the

light was too strong on the portrait too

strong no the light is perfect in here

let me see it and Hall would walk

towards the corner of the room a

terrible cry came from Dorian Gray's

lips and he rushed between the painter

and the covered portrait hassel you must

not look at it I don't want you to not

look at my own work are you serious why

shouldn't I look at it

cried hallward laughing if you try and

look at it basil I promise I will never

speak to you again I am very serious

Hallward looked at Dorian Gray and

surprised he had never seen him like

this before the boys face was white and

angry Dorian don't speak but what is the

matter of course I won't look at it if

you don't want me to he said coldly

walking over to the window but it seemed

rather absurd that I can't see my own

work and I'm going to exhibit it in

Paris in the autumn to exhibit it you

want to exhibit it cried Dorian Gray a

terrible fear was building inside him

was the world going to see his secret

were people going to stare at the

mystery of his life that was impossible

yes George patty is going to exhibit all

my best pictures in October don't worry

it is only for one month Dorian Gray

passed his hand across his face it felt

hot and wet he felt that he was about to

face horrible danger you told me a month

ago that you would never exhibit it he

cried why have you changed your mind he

stopped suddenly and a cruel look came

into his eyes he had remembered

something Lord Henry had said to him ask

basil why he won't exhibit your picture

he told me once and it is a very strange

story yes perhaps basil too had his

secret he would ask him and try basil he

said coming over quite close and looking

him straight in the face we all have

secrets what was your reason for not

wanting to exhibit my picture Dorian if

I told you you might like me less than

you do now and you would certainly laugh

at me if you don't want me ever to look

at your picture again

won't I have always you to look at your

friendship is more important to me than

exhibiting a painting no basil you must

tell me said Dorian Gray his feeling of

fear had passed away now he just wanted

to find out basil hallward's mystery

Dorian said the painter who did not look

happy have you ever noticed something in

the picture something strange puzzle

cried the boy staring at him with wild

eyes I see you did

Dorian from the moment I met you your

personality had the most extraordinary

influence over me I worshipped you I was

jealous of everyone you spoke to I

wanted to have you all to myself

I was only happy when I was with you

when you were away from me you were

still there in my art basil no don't

speak I must tell you now what I did not

tell you then that I decided to paint a

wonderful portrait of you I put all my

feelings for you into that picture I

felt Dorian that I had told too much I

had put too much of myself into it so I

decided never to exhibit the portrait I

told Harry and he laughed when the

picture was finished and I sat alone

with it I felt that I was right later I

thought that perhaps I was being foolish

and when this Paris offer came but I see

now that the picture cannot be shown

Dorian Gray breathed deeply the colour

back to his cheeks and a smile crossed

his lips the danger was over and he was

safe for a while what a sad story basil

had told would he ever be so influenced

by the personality of a friend Lord

Henry had the charm of being very

dangerous but that was all it is

extraordinary to me Dorian said ho would

that you saw this in the portrait I saw

something in it he answered something

that seemed me and very strange

well you don't mind me looking at the

thing now Dorian shook his head you must

not ask me that basil I can't let you

stand in front of that picture you will

one day won't you never well perhaps you

are right and now goodbye Dorian you

have been the one person in my life who

has really influenced my art but you

don't know what it cost me to tell you

all that I have told you my dear basil

said Dorian what have you told me only

that you worshipped me too much that is

not even flattering it was not meant as

flattery and now that I have told you

something seems to have gone out of me

perhaps you should never put what you

worship into words you mustn't talk

about worship it is foolish you and I

are friends basil and we will always be

friends

[Music]

you have got Harry said the painter

sadly Oh Harry

laughed the young man Harry spends his

life saying and doing extraordinary

things he lives the sort of life I want

to live but I don't think I would go to

Harry if I was in trouble I would prefer

to go to you basil

we'll sit for me again impossible

there is something terrible about a

portrait it has a life of its own I will

come and have tea with you instead well

goodbye then I am sorry that you won't

let me look at the picture again but I

understand what you feel about it as he

left the room

dorian gray's smiled to himself for a

basil how little he knew of the true

reason and now he understood more the

painter's wild and jealous feelings and

he felt sorry there was something tragic

in a friendship so corrupted by passion

he rang the bell to call his servant he

had to hide the portrait immediately it

had been mad of him to leave it in a

place where it could be discovered by

his friends chapter 8 when the servant

entered Dorian Gray asked him to send

mrs. leaf to him in the library mrs.

leaf had been with his family for many

years he asked her for the key to the

old schoolroom the old schoolroom mr.

dori she cried but it is full of dust I

must clean it first

I don't want it cleaned mrs. leaf I only

want the key well so you'll be covered

with dust if you go into it it hasn't

been opened for nearly five years not

since your grandfather died he frowned

at this reminder of his grandfather he

had bad memories of all his family that

does not matter

he answered I just want to see the place

that is all give me the key here is the

key sir said the old lady but you are

not going to live up there are you sir

no no he cried Thank You mrs. leaf you

can go an hour later two men arrived to

move the portrait it's very heavy sir

said one of the men as they climbed the

stairs

I am afraid it is rather heavy said

Dorian as he opened the door of the old

schoolroom where he was going to hide

the secret of his corrupted soul he had

not entered the room since he was a

child it was a large room built by his

grandfather to keep him at a distance

every moment of his lonely childhood

came back to him as he looked round it

was a room full of terrible memories but

it was safe he had the key and no other

person could enter it the face in the

portrait could grow old and ugly what

did it matter no one could see it he

himself would not see it he did not have

to watch the terrible corruption of his

soul he would stay young that was enough

when the men had gone Dorian locked the

door and put the key in his pocket he

felt safe now no one would ever look at

that horrible thing only he would ever

see his shame he went back to the

library and found a note from Lord Henry

in it was a report from the newspaper

about Sibyl vane her death was

officially described as an accident he

frowned and tore the paper in two then

he walked across the room and threw the

pieces away how ugly it all was and how

horribly real ugliness made things

perhaps the servant had read the report

and had begun to suspect something and

yet what did it matter what had dorian

gray to do with Sibyl vanes death there

was nothing to be afraid of Dorian Gray

had not killed her chapter 9

many years passed yet the wonderful

beauty that had so fascinated basil

Hallward stayed with Dorian Gray even

those who had heard terrible rumors

against him could not believe them when

they met him he always had the look of

someone who had kept himself pure many

people suspected that there was

something very wrong with Dorian's life

but only he knew about the portrait some

nights he would secretly enter the

locked room holding a mirror in his hand

he would stand in front of the picture

basil Hallward had painted he would look

first at the horrible old face in the

picture and then at the handsome young

face that laughed back at him from the

mirror he fell more and more in love

with his own beauty and more and more

interested in the corruption of his own

soul then something happened that

changed everything it was on the 9th of

November

the day before his 38th birthday he was

walking home from Lord Henry's and the

night was cold and foggy at the corner

of Grosvenor Square and South Audley

Street a man passed him in the fog

he was walking very fast and had the

collar of his coat turned up he had a

bag in his hand

Dorian recognized him it was basil

Hallward a strange fear made Dorian walk

off quickly in the direction of his own

house but Hallward had seen him Dorian

heard him hurrying after him in a few

moments his hand was on his arm Dorian

what an extraordinary piece of luck I

have been waiting for you in your

library ever since nine o'clock I'm

going to Paris on the midnight train and

I wanted to see you before I left I

thought it was you or at least your coat

as I passed you but I wasn't sure didn't

you recognize me in this fog My dear

basil I can't even recognize Grosvenor

Square

I believe my house is somewhere about

here but I don't feel at all certain

about it

I'm sorry you're going away as I have

not seen you for such a long time but I

suppose you will be back soon no I'm

going to be out of England for six

months here we are at your door let me

come in for a moment I have something to

say to you that would be lovely but

won't you miss your train said Dorian

Gray as he went up the steps and opened

the door with his key I have plenty of

time he answered the train doesn't go

until 12:15 and it is early just eleven

all I have with me is this bag and I can

easily get to Victoria Station in 20

minutes

Dorian looked at him and smiled come in

or the fog will get into my house

halt would followed Dorian into the

library there was a bright wood fire on

one side of the room and two lamps on

the other would you like a drink

asked Dorian and no thanks I won't have

anything more said the painter taking

his hat and coat off and now my dear

Dorian I want to speak to you seriously

don't frown like that you make it so

much more difficult for me what is it

all about cried Dorian throwing himself

down on the sofa I hope it is not about

myself I am tired of myself tonight I

would prefer to be somebody different it

is about yourself answered Hallward in

his deep voice and I must say it to you

Dorian breathe deeply and lit a

cigarette is it really necessary basil I

think you should know some of the

terrible things that people are saying

about you I don't want to know anything

about them

I love scandals about other people but

scandals about myself don't interest me

every gentleman is interested in his

good name Dorian you don't want people

to talk of you as something terrible and

corrupt but I don't believe these

rumours at all at least I can't believe

them when I see you corruption is a

thing that writes itself across a

face it cannot be hidden my dear basil

and yet I rarely see you now and you

never come to my house when I hear all

the terrible things people are

whispering about you I don't know what

to say

why have so many of your friends killed

themselves young men from good families

like Adrian singleton and that poor

young soldier stop basil you are talking

about things of which you know nothing

said Dorian I know how people talk in

England this is a country where people

have two faces they whisper rumors about

people like myself and then do much

worse things when others are not looking

Dorian cried Hallward that is not the

question

I know England is bad but that's the

reason I want you to be a good influence

on your friends instead you have lost

all belief in goodness and honesty you

have filled those poor young men with a

madness for pleasure Dorian smiled how

can you smile like that I only want you

to have a clean name you have a

wonderful influence let it be for good

yet I wonder whether I know you but I

can't answer that question I would need

to see your soul to see my soul cried

Dorian Gray he jumped up from the sofa

turning almost white with fear yes

answered Hallward there was a deep

sadness in his voice to see your soul

but only God can do that

a bitter laugh came from the lips of the

younger man you will see it yourself

tonight he cried picking up a lamp from

the table come it is your own work why

shouldn't you look at it you can tell

the world all about it after if you want

nobody will believe you if they do

believe you they will like me better for

it come I tell you you have talked

enough about corruption now you will see

it face to face there was mad

in every word he said he felt a terrible

delight that someone was going to share

his secret the man who had painted the

portrait was going to share his shame

the painter would suffer for the rest of

his life with the memory of what he had

done yes he continued coming closer to

him I will show you my soul you will see

what you think only God can see Hallward

jumped back

you cannot say things like that Dorian

he cried they are horrible and they

don't mean anything you think so he

laughed again I know so Dorian you have

to tell me don't touch me finish what

you have to say

the painter felt extraordinarily sad he

walked over to the fire and stood there

I am waiting basil said the young man in

a hard clear voice he turned round what

I have to say is this he cried you must

give me some answer to the horrible

things people are saying against you

tell me that they are not true Dorian

can't you see what I'm going through my

god don't tell me that you are bad and

corrupt and shameful Dorian Gray smiled

come upstairs basil he said quietly I

keep a diary of my life from day to day

I will show it to you if you come up

with me I will come with you Dorian if

you wish it I see I have missed my train

it does not matter I can go tomorrow but

don't ask me to read anything tonight

all I want is a simple answer to my

question I will give it to your upstairs

I could not give it to you here you will

not have to read for long chapter

he passed out of the room and began

climbing the stairs basil Hallward

followed close behind

they walked softly as people always do

at night the lamp made strange shadows

on the wall and stairs when they reached

the top Dorian put the lamp down on the

floor he took the key out of his pocket

and turned it in the lock you really

want to know basil he asked in a low

voice yes I am delighted he answered

smiling then he added you are the one

man in the world I want to know

everything about me

you have influenced my life more than

you think taking up the lamp he opened

the door and went in cold air passed

between them shut the door behind you he

whispered as he placed the lamp on the

table

Hallward looked around the room and

surprised the room and clearly not been

lived in for years the whole place was

covered with dust and there were holes

in the carpet a mouse ran across the

floor so you think that it is only God

who sees the soul basil take the cover

off the portrait and you will see mine

the voice that spoke was cold and cruel

you are mad Dorian said Hallward

frowning you won't take the cover off

then I will do it myself

said the young man throwing the old

purple curtain to the ground a cry of

fear came from the painters lips when he

saw the face in the portrait it was

Dorian Gray's face he was looking at and

it still had some of that wonderful

beauty but now there were terrible signs

of age and corruption but who had done

it he held the lamp up to the picture in

the left-hand corner was his name

painted in red as it happened he had

never done that still it was his own

sure he knew it and it made his blood

turned to ice his own picture what did

it mean why had it changed he turned and

looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a

sick man the young man was standing near

the wall watching him he had taken the

flower out of his coat and was smelling

it does this mean cried Hallward at last

his own voice sounded high and strange

years ago when I was a boy said Dorian

Gray closing his hand on the flower you

met me and flattered me you taught me to

love my beauty one day you introduced me

to a friend of yours he explained to me

how wonderful it was to be young you've

finished a portrait of me that showed me

how wonderful it was to be beautiful in

a mad moment I made a wish I remember it

how how well I remember it no the thing

is impossible there must be something

wrong with the paint I tell you the

thing is impossible is anything really

impossible said the young man going over

to the window you told me you had

destroyed it I was wrong

it has destroyed me don't believe it is

my picture there was nothing bad in it

nothing shameful you were perfect to me

this is a face from hell it is the face

of my soul each of us has heaven and

hell in him basil cried Dorian wildly

Hallward turned again to the portrait

and stared at it my god it's this true

he cried is this what you have done with

your life you must be even worse than

people say Allwood threw himself into

the chair by the table and put his face

in his hands the lamp fell to the floor

and went out good god Dorian

what an awful lesson what an awful

lesson

there was no answer but he could hear

the young man crying of the window we

must ask God for forgiveness I

worshipped you too much I am punished

for it you worshipped yourself too much

we are both punished Dorian Gray turns

slowly around and looked at him there

were tears in his eyes it is too late

basil he said don't you see that hellish

things staring at us Dorian Gray looked

at the picture suddenly he felt that he

hated basil Hallward he hated the man

sitting at the table more than he hated

anything in his life

he looked wildly around something Sean

on top of the painted cupboard that

faced him it was a knife he had left

there some days before he moved slowly

towards it

passing Hallward as he did so he took

the knife in his hand and turned around

Hallward moved in his chair he rushed at

him and stuck the knife into his neck

again and again he threw the knife down

on the table and stood back he could

hear nothing but the sound of blood

falling onto the carpet he opened the

door and went out onto the stairs the

house was completely quiet no one was

there how quickly it had all been done

feeling strangely calm he walked over to

the window and opened it the wind had

blown the fog away and the sky was clear

he looked down and saw a policeman

walking down the street he was shining a

lamp in all the houses closing the

window he went back into the room he did

not look at the murdered man he felt

that the secret of the whole thing was

not to think about it at all the friend

who had painted the terrible portrait

had gone out of his life that was enough

he picked up the lamp and walked out of

the room locking the door behind him as

he walked down the stairs he thought

that he heard what sounded like cries of

pain he stopped several times and waited

no everything was still when he reached

the library he saw the bag and coat in

the corner

they must be hidden away somewhere he

unlocked a secret cupboard and threw

them in he could easily burn them later

then he pulled out his watch

it was twenty minutes to two he sat down

and began to think basil Hallward had

left the house at eleven no one had seen

him coming again the servants were in

bed Paris yes it was to Paris that basil

had gone and by the midnight train as he

had planned it would be months before

anyone suspected anything months he

could destroy everything long before

then suddenly he had a thought he put on

his coat and hat and went into the front

room from the window he could see the

policeman passing the house he waited

and held his breath after a few moments

he went out of the house shutting the

door very gently behind him then he

began ringing the bell in about five

minutes a servant appeared he was half

dressed and looked very sleepy I am

sorry I had to wake you up Frances he

said stepping in but I have forgotten my

key what time is it

ten minutes past two sir answered the

man looking at a clock ten minutes past

two how horribly late you must wake me

at nine tomorrow I have some work to do

all right sir

did anyone call this evening mr.

Hallward sir he stayed here until 11:00

and then he went away to catch his train

oh I am sorry I didn't see him did he

leave any message no sir

he said he would write to you from Paris

that is all Francis don't forget to call

me at 9:00 tomorrow no sir

the man went off to his bedroom Dorian

Gray threw his hat and coat upon the

table and passed into the library for a

quarter of an hour he walked up and down

the room biting his lip and thinking

then he took down a book from one of the

cupboards and began to turn the pages

Allen Campbell a hundred and fifty to

Hartford Street Mayfair yes that was the

man he wanted Chapter eleven at nine

o'clock the next morning his servant

came in with a cup of chocolate and

opened the curtains Dorian was sleeping

quite peacefully lying with one hand

under his cheek as he opened his eyes a

smile passed across his lips he turned

round and began to drink his chocolate

the November Sun came into the room and

the sky was bright it was almost like a

morning in May slowly he remembered what

had happened the night before the dead

man was still sitting there and in the

sunlight now how horrible that was such

terrible things were for the darkness

not the day after he had drunk his cup

of chocolate he went over to the table

and wrote two letters one he put in his

pocket and the other he handed to his

servant take this round to one hundred

and fifty to Hartford Street Frances if

mr. Campbell is out of town get his

address and the servant had gone he lit

a cigarette and began drawing on a piece

of paper first he drew flowers then

houses then human faces suddenly he

realized that every face he drew looked

like basil Hallward he frowned and went

over to lie on the sofa an hour went

past very slowly

every second he kept looking up at the

clock

minutes went by he became horribly

worried he got up and walked around the

room his hands were strangely cold at

last the door opened and his servant

entered mr. Campbell sir said the man

the colour came back to his cheeks ask

him to come in at once Francis he felt

himself again his fear had gone away in

a few moments Alan Campbell walked in he

looked very angry and rather worried

Alan this is kind of you I thank you for

coming I hoped never to enter your house

again gray but you said it was a

question of life and death

his voice was hard and cold and he kept

his hands in the pockets of his coat yes

it is a question of life and death Alan

and to more than one person sit down

Campbell took a chair by the table and

Dorian sat opposite him the two men's

eyes met in Dorian's there was great

sadness he knew that what he was going

to do was terrible after a moment of

silence Dorian said very quietly Alan in

a locked room at the top of the house a

dead man is sitting at a table he has

been dead for ten hours now don't stir

and don't look at me like that you don't

need to know who this man is you don't

need to know how or why he died what you

have to do is this

stop grey I don't want to know anything

more I don't care if what you tell me is

true or not true I don't want any part

in your life

keep your horrible secrets to yourself

they don't interest me anymore Alan they

will have to interest you I am awfully

sorry for you Alan but I can't help

myself you are the one man who can save

me Alan you are a scientist you know

about chemistry and things of that kind

what you have got to do is to destroy

the thing that he's upstairs you are mad

Dorian I will have nothing to do with

this he killed himself

Alan I am glad of that

but who made him do it you I suppose

Pierre still refused to do this for me

of course I refuse you have come to the

wrong man go to some of your friends

don't come to me

Alain it was murder I killed him you

don't know what he made me suffer murder

good god Dorian is that what you have

come to I will have nothing to do with

it you must have something to do with it

don't ask any more questions I have told

you too much already

but you must do this we were friends

once Alain don't speak of those days

Dorian they are dead they will hang me

for this Alan don't you understand they

will kill me for what I have done

Campbell got up to leave I will not have

anything to do with this you refuse yes

the same look of sadness came into

Dorian Gray's eyes then he took a piece

of paper and wrote something on it he

read it over and pushed it across the

table then he got up and went over to

the window

Campbell looked at him in surprise and

picked up the paper as he read it his

face went white and he fell back in his

chair after two or three minutes without

speaking Dorian came and stood next to

him I am very sorry for you Alan he said

putting his hand on his shoulder but

there is no other way I have a letter

written already here it is you see the

address if you don't help me I will send

it you know what will happen but you are

going to help me it is impossible for

you to refuse now Campbell put his face

in his hands the thing is quite simple

Alan it has to be done face it and do it

a terrible sound came from Campbell's

lips come Alan you must decide now Alan

paused for a moment is there a fire

the room upstairs yes there is a gas

fire I must go home and get some things

no Alan you must not leave the house

write out what you wanted my servant

will get the things for you

it was nearly 2 o'clock when the servant

returned with an enormous wooden box

filled with the things Campbell had

asked for you can have the rest of the

day to yourself Francis thank you sir

when the servant had left the two men

carried the box up the stairs Dorian

took out the key and turned it in the

lock then he stopped and Campbell saw

that his eyes were full of tears I don't

think I can go in Alan he said I don't

need you said Campbell coldly Dorian

half opened the door as he did so he saw

the face of the portrait staring in the

sunlight he remembered that the night

before he had forgotten to cover the

picture he was about to rush forward

when he saw something that made him jump

back there was blood on one of the hands

in the portrait horrible it was

he hurried into the room trying not to

look at the dead man picking the curtain

off the floor he threw it over the

picture then he rushed out of the room

and down the stairs it was long after

7:00 when Campbell came back into the

library he was quiet and white in the

face but very calm I have done what you

asked me to do he said and now goodbye

let us never see each other again you

have saved me Alan I cannot forget that

said Dorian simply when Campbell had

left he went upstairs there was a

horrible smell in the room but the thing

that had been sitting at the table was

gone

chapter 12 don't tell

that you're going to be good cried Lord

Henry you're quite perfect don't change

Dorian Gray shook his head no Harry I

have done too many terrible things in my

life I am NOT going to do any more but

tell me what is happening here in London

I have been out of the country for more

than a month

people are still discussing poor Basil's

disappearance

are they not bored with that yet said

Dorian pouring out some wine and

frowning

My dear boy they have only been talking

about it for six weeks the British Army

need one subject of conversation every

three months they have been very lucky

recently though first there was the

scandal of my wife leaving me and then

Alan Campbell killed himself now there

is the mysterious disappearance of an

artist the British police are saying

that basil did take the midnight train

on the 9th of November but the French

police are sure that he never arrived in

Paris at all what do you think has

happened to basil asked Dorian holding

up his wine against the light I have no

idea if basil wants to hide himself it

is no business of mine if he is dead I

don't want to think about him death is

the only thing that ever frightens me

I hate it why said the younger man and a

tired voice because said Lord Henry it

is the only thing that is final let us

have our coffee in the music room Dorian

you must play Chopin through me the man

who ran away with my wife played Chopin

beautifully poor Victoria I was very

fond of her the house is quite lonely

without her Dorian said nothing but went

into the next room and sat at the piano

after the coffee had been brought in he

stopped playing Harry he said looking

over to Lord Henry do you think basil

was murdered

Lord Henry yawned everyone likes

who would want to murder him he was not

clever enough to have enemies of course

he was a wonderful painter but a man can

paint like Velazquez and yet still be

rather boring basil was really rather

boring the only thing that interested me

about him is that he worshipped you I

was very fond of basil said Dorian sadly

but don't people say he was murdered Oh

some newspapers do but I don't think it

is likely I know there are awful places

in Paris but basil was not the sort of

man to go to them what would you say

Harry if I told you that I had murdered

basil said the younger man he watched

him carefully after he had spoken no

Dorian you would not murder anyone it is

ordinary people a murder it is their way

of finding the extraordinary pleasure

that art gives us a way of finding the

extraordinary pleasure do you think that

a man who has murdered could do it again

don't tell me that Oh

anything becomes a pleasure if you do it

too often cried Lord Henry laughing that

is one of the most important secrets of

life I believe though that murder is

always a mistake one should never do

anything one cannot talk about after

dinner but let us pass from poor basil I

wish I could believe that he has died

some romantic death but I can't he

probably fell into the Seine off a bus I

can see him now lying on his back in the

dirty green water during the last ten

years he had not been painting well

Lord Henry walked across the room and

touched the head of a strange gray bird

that he kept in the music room then he

turned to face Dorian yes

he continued taking his handkerchief out

of his pocket his paintings seemed to me

to have lost something when you and he

stopped being great friends he stopped

being a great artist what was it that

separated you

I suppose he bored you

if so he never forgave you by the way

what happened to that wonderful portrait

he did of you I don't think I've ever

seen it since he finished it I told you

years ago that it was stolen oh I

remember you never got it back what a

shame it really was wonderful

I remember I wanted to buy it I wish I

had it now I had never really liked it

said Dorian I am sorry I sat for it the

memory of the thing is hateful to me how

sad you look don't be so serious play me

some music Torian and as you play tell

me in a low voice why you still look so

young

I am only ten years older than you are

and I have gray hair and yellow skin you

are really wonderful Dorian Harry please

you have never looked more charming than

you do tonight you remind me of the day

I first saw you you were very shy and

absolutely extraordinary you have

changed of course but not an appearance

you are still the same

I am not the same Harry yes you are the

same I wish I could change places with

you Dorian the world has cried out

against us both but it has always

worshipped you it always will worship

you life has been your art Dorian got up

from the piano and passed his hand

through his hair yes life has been

beautiful he said quietly but I am NOT

going to have the same life Harry and

you must not say these things to me you

don't know everything about me I think

that if you did even you would turn away

from me you laugh don't laugh why have

you stopped playing Dorian let us go to

the club it has been a charming evening

and we must end it charmingly there is

someone I want to introduce to you young

Lord pool

he has already copied your ties and he

very much wants to meet you

he is quite charming and he reminds me

of you I hope not

said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes

but I am tired tonight Harry I won't go

to the club

it is nearly 11:00 and I want to go to

bed early please stay you have never

played so well as tonight it is because

I am going to be good

you answered smiling I am a little

changed already you can't change to me

Dorian said Lord Henry you and I will

always be friends come round tomorrow we

shall go to lunch do you really want me

to come Harry certainly the park is

quite lovely now I don't think that have

been such flowers since the year I met

you very well I shall be here at 11:00

said Dorian goodnight Harry

chapter 13 it was a lovely night he

walked home with his coat on his arm

smoking his cigarette two young men an

evening dress passed him he heard one of

them whisper to the other at his poor

Ian gray he remembered how pleased he

used to be when he was stared at or

talked about he was tired of hearing his

own name now when he reached home he

found his servant waiting up for him he

sent him to bed and threw himself down

on the sofa in the library he began to

think about some of the things that Lord

Henry had said to him was it really true

that one could never change there had

been a time when he had been good and

innocent he had corrupted himself and

become a terrible influence on others he

had even got pleasure from this

corruption yet his soul had once been

the purest of all was all that gone was

there no hope for him in one terrible

moment of passion he had asked to stay

young for all time all his failure had

been because of that he had not been

punished but perhaps punishment was what

he had needed punishment cleaned the

soul the mirror

Lord Henry had given to him so many

years ago now was standing on the table

he picked it up remembering that

horrible night when he had first noticed

the change in the picture once someone

who had loved him passionately had

written him a mad letter it had ended

with these words the world is changed

because you were made of gold he

repeated them to himself and suddenly

realized that he hated his own beauty

throwing the mirror on the floor he

broke the glass into little pieces with

his foot

it was his beauty that had spoiled him

it was better not to think of the past

nothing could change that he had to

think of his future Alan Campbell had

shot himself one night and his terrible

secret had died with him the interest in

basil hallward's disappearance would

soon pass away he was perfectly safe

there what worried him was the death of

his own soul basil had painted the

portrait that had destroyed his life he

could not forgive him that it was the

portrait that had done everything the

murder had just been the madness of the

moment as for Alan Campbell he had

killed himself it was nothing to do with

Dorian Gray a new life that was what he

wanted that was what he was waiting for

perhaps it had begun already

he would never again spoil innocence he

would be good he began to wonder if the

portrait in the locked room had changed

was it still as horrible as it had been

perhaps if his life became pure the face

in the portrait would become beautiful

again he would go and look he took the

lamp from the table and went upstairs as

he opened the door a smile of happiness

passed across his young face yes he

would be good and the ugly thing he had

locked away would not frighten him any

more he felt happier already he went in

quietly locking the door behind him

walking straight over to the portrait he

took off the purple curtain that was

covering it

an angry cry of pain came from him he

could see no change the thing was still

hateful more hateful even than before

the red mark on the hand seems brighter

and more like new blood and why was the

red mark larger than it had been it was

all over the fingers now there was blood

on the painted feet and blood on the

hand that had not held the knife did it

all mean that he should go to the police

that he should tell the whole story and

be put to death he laughed he felt the

idea was absurd if he did tell him now

who would believe him there was nothing

left of the murdered man anywhere he had

destroyed everything belonging to basil

Hallward he himself had burnt the bag

and the coat they would simply say he

was mad was this murder to follow him

all his life

was he always going to suffer because of

his past yet what could he do go to the

police never there was only one thing

they could use against him and that was

the picture itself he would destroy it

why had he kept it so long once it had

given him pleasure to watch it changing

and growing old recently he had felt no

such pleasure it had kept him awake at

night when he had been away he'd been

frightened that another person would see

it just the memory of it's spoiled many

moments of happiness he would destroy it

he looked around and saw the knife that

had killed basil Hallward he'd cleaned

it many times until there was no mark

left on it it was bright and it's Sean

it had killed the painter now it would

kill the painters work and all that it

meant it would kill the past and that

was dead he would be free he picked up

the knife and pushed it into the picture

there was a cry and a

the cry was so horrible that frightened

servants woke and came out of their

rooms two gentlemen who were passing in

the square below stopped and looked up

at the great house

they hurried on until they met a

policeman and brought him back

the policeman rang the bell several

times but there was no answer except for

a light in one of the top windows the

house was all dark after a time he went

away and stood in the garden of the next

house and watched whose house is that

asked the older of the two gentlemen mr.

Dorian Gray's answered the policeman

they looked at each other as they walked

away and laughed cruelly they knew who

Dorian Gray was inside the house the

servants were talking in low whispers to

each other

old mrs. leaf was crying Frances was as

white as death after about a quarter of

an hour they went fearfully upstairs

they knocked but there was no reply they

called out everything was still they

tried the door it was locked

finally they got on the roof and came

into the room through the window when

they entered the room they found a

portrait hanging on the wall it showed

mr. Dorian Gray as they had last seen

him young and beautiful lying on the

floor was a dead man in evening dress he

had a knife in his heart he was old and

horribly ugly it was not until they saw

his rings that they recognized who the

man was
