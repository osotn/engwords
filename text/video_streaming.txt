Streaming media and webcasting often are used synonymously.
Webcasting embraces both streaming and file download.
Streamed media is delivered direct from the source to the player in real time.

A normal unicast stream over IP uses a one to one connection between the server and the client
(the media player).

The development of streaming has benefited from a very wide range of disciplines.
We can thank the neurophysiologists for the research in understanding the psychoacoustics of
human hearing that has been so vital to the design of audio compression algorithms.
Similar work has led to advances in video compression.
The information technology engineers constantly are improving content delivery within the
framework of the existing Web infrastructure.

L7 - application, presentation, session, transport (TCP/IP), network (IP), Link (ARP), physicals

UDP - ignore data errors.

E-mail			SMTP		TCP
Remote terminal 	Telnet		TCP
Web			HTTP		TCP
File transfer		FTP		TCP
Remote file server 	NFS		UDP
Streaming media		RTSP		UDP
Voice-over IP		-		UDP
Network management      SNMP		UDP
Routing protocol	RIP		UDP
Name Translation 	DNS		UDP

Real time protocols: RSVP, RTCP (RT Control P), RTSP (RT Streaming P), RTP, SDP (session desc P).

Intimately linked to real-time delivery is the quality of service (QoS).
To ensure the reliable delivery of packets, the network bandwidth would have to be reserved for the stream.

RTP = transport protocol. Includes extra data fields not present in TCP, it provides a time stamp
and sequence number to facilitate the data trasport timing:
	- sequence number	16bit to detect packet loss
	- Timestamp		jitter calculation
	- Source identifier: SSRC
Run on UDP:

RTCP is used in conjunction with RTP. It gives feedback to each participant in an RTP session
that can be used to control the session.

SDP = session description protocol - media desc format

RTSP - application level protocol for the control of real time multimedia data.
Extensible framework rather than a protocol. It allows interactive, VCR like control of the playback:
Play, Pause, so on. Similar to HTTP, but has state of a session.

RTSP support the use of RTP as underlying data delivery protocol: choice - UDP, multicast UDP, TCP.

WWW = World Wide Web
Universal adoption of the web browser as the user interface.
Original Web was text based.

Terminal <========> Mainframe

Client app <======> Database server

Web client <======> Multi layer model: Web server, application server, database server

The web browser is becoming the de facto thin client.
So, although a stand alone media player can request files directly from the content server and
play stand alone, the players most often are embedded in the web client.

WWW is the generic name for all the web pages that can be accessed via the Internet.
At the heart lies the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). Hypertext is electronic text that has
cross links within the document and between documents.

HTML is a language developed to describe how text, graphics, and other information are formatted
into documents, and how those documents are organized and linked together.
Only text - images and media files are referenced by linked.

XML - extensible Markup language - for generic data exchange between applications.

HTTP = Hyper Text Transport Protocol for delivery of HTML files.
It is used for application level communication between the browser and the web server:
	- requests			- responsed
The headers indicate the purpose of a request - URI = URL / URN
HTTP uses RTSP, SMTP, FTP = over TCP/IP.

A basic web browser will render HTML files into a screen image.
Text is sent as straight ASCII like format; the font properties are sent separately as tags and
rendered by the browser to give the appropriate display. Text formatting codes give positional
information for the text, and enable the author to use other devices like tables and forms.

The source files for bit-mapped images are potentially very large, which leads to long download
times - unpopular with users.

GIF = graphic interchange format = raster graphic into compact file.
PNG = portable network graphics
JPEG = joint photographic experts group.

Animating pages: is a halfway house to streaming. = Macromedia Flash
GIF, Flash, DHTML

Video Formats
=============
Capture or ingest
Frame rates - 25 or 30 frames per second.

Video compression
================
- lossy (1:20)  and - loseless (1:3)

JPEG
The compression of a single image in the spatial domain is called intraframe - within the frame.
Video editing systems have used an extension to JPEG called motion JPEG, where the video
sequince is compressed as a sequence of individual frames.

A sequence of video images has a little change from one picture to the next, except at scene
changes. This redundancy can be exploited by transmitting only the difference between
successive pictures. - interframe (additional 3:1)

Visual perception:

====================
CSI interface (15 pins) = camera serial interface
 - or Ethernet, USB, HDMI

v4l2 (video4linux) + ffmpeq from /dev/video0 + rtsp stream
GStreamer + VLC 

Raspberry Pi with multi camera adapter, Jetson Nano, 


Delay - 1) as transport for rtsp using UDP instead TCP
	2) VLC отключить кеширование сетевых потоков в настройках
