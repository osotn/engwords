Tom: Sam!
Sam: Hi Tom!
T: Hi Sam. Escaped for a few
minutes?
S: I've just been to the bank.
T: Oh yeah?
S: To see about a loan to
 improve the kitchen.
T: Oh right. How did it go?
S: I don't really know. You know
 banks... they never say much
 at first. And then they say no!
T: Yeah, the same thing happened
 to me.
S: At the bank?
T: No, at the estate agent's.
 They weren't very helpful.
S: Yeah, right, finding
 somewhere to live. It's really
 difficult, isn't it?
T: Yeah, it is. Sorry. I've got
 to get back to work. Are you
 going this way?
S: Yeah. Erm, Becky said it's
 been hard work.
T: Yeah, we missed out on the
 perfect flat.
S: Hmm, I know feeling.
T: Oh?
S: It was just like that when I
 was looking for the cafe.
T: But you found a good place.
 The cafe's great. And it's in
 a good location.
S: In the end. Someone else got
 it first - then they changed
 their mind.
T: Oh right.
S: So you never know.
T: Well, I've learnt one thing.
S: What's that?
T: The next time we find the
 perfect place, I'll say yes
 straight away.
