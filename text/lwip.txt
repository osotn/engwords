book - design and implementation of the lwIP TCP/IP stack
---

is implementation of the TCP/IP protocol stack.

In order to make lwIP portable, OS specific function calls and data structures are not
used directly in the code.
Sychronization provided is semaphores.
The message passing is done via mailboxes - post and fetch.
Post - not block process.

pbuf is lwIP - packet.

ip_input() - incoming IP packets.
ip_output()

ip_route()

forwarding packets - packet be forwarded if no same IP.
ip_forward()

use IPC: shared memory, message passing, semaphores

netbuf - network buffer
netconn - network connection


8. IP processing
----------------
Can send, receive and forward packets.
But cannot send and receive fragmented IP packets.

For incoming IP packets, processing begins when the ip_input() function is called by
a network device driver.
An outgoing packet is handled by the function ip_output(), which use the fucntion
ip_route() to find the appropriate network interface to transmit the packet on.
Then to ip_output_if().
IP address, the gw field.

ip_forward().
