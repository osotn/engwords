A. What do you do?
To find out what someone's job is you say:
 " What do you do ?"

I work for a large European car market. I work on car design. In fact, I run the design department and I manage a team of designers: 20 people work under me. It's very interesting. One of my main responsibilities is to make sure that new model designs are finished on time. I'm also in charge of design budgets.
I deal with a lot of different people in the company. I'm responsible for co-ordination between design and production: I work with managers at our manufacturing plants.
