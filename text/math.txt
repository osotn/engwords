Discrete mathematics with applications - Susanna Epp
----------------------------------------------------

Discrete maths describes processes that consist of sequence of individual steps.

Variable in a computer program is similar to a mathematical variable because
it creates a location in computer memory (either actual or virtual) into which
values can placed.

Set is a collection of elements.
Notation  x ∈ S means that x is an element of S.
          x ∉ S means that x isn't

Set may be specified using the set-roster notation by writing all of its elements
between braces {}.

Symbol ... is called an ellipsis and is read "and fo forth".

Axion of extension: says that a set is completely determined by what its elements
are - not the order in which they might be listed or the fact that some elements
might be listed more than once.

= {1, 2, 3} - set-roster notation

R - set of all real number
Z              integer
Q              rational, or quotients of integers

N - natural numbers.

Set builder notation a set and let P(x) be a property that elements of S
may or may not satisfy.

{x ∈ S | P(x)} - the set of all elements x in S such that P(x) is true.

If A and B are sets, then A is called a subset of B, written A ⊆ B, if, and
only if, every element A is also an element of B.

Let A and B is sets. A is a proper subset of B if, and only if, every element of
A is B but there is at least one of B that is not in A.

Given elements a and b, the symbol (a, b) denotes the ordered pair consisting of
a and b together with specification that a is the first element of the pair and
b is the second. Two ordered pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are equal if, and only if,
a = c and b = d. Symbolically:
    (a, b) = (c, d) means that  a = c and b = d.

Ordered n-tuple

1.3 The language or relations and functions
-------------------------------------------

A functioin F from a set A to set B is a relation with domain A and co-domain B
that satisfies the following two properties:
    For every element x in A, there is an element y in B such that (x,y) ∈ F
    For all elements x in A and y and z in B
        if (x, y) ∈ F and (x, z) ∈ F, then y = x.

If A and B are sets and F is a function from A to B, the given any element x in
A, the unique element in B that is related to x by F is denoted F(x), which is
read "F of x".

1.4 The language of graphs
--------------------------

The dots are called virtices (plural of vertex)
The line segments joining vertices are called edges.

When an edge connects a vertex to itself, it is called a loop.

A directed graph, or digraph, consists of two finite sets: a nonempty set
V(G) of vertices and a set D(G) of directed edges, where each is associated with
an ordered pair or vertices called its endpoints. If edge e is associated with
the pair (v, w) of vertices, then e is said to be directed edge from v to w.


2. The logic of compound statements
-----------------------------------

~ denotes not
∧ denotes and - conjunction
∨ denotes or  - disjunction

Double negative property  ~(~p) ≡ p

De Morgan's laws:


order of operations specifies that ~ is performed first.
    ~(p ∧ q) = ~p ∨ ~q
    ~(p ∨ q) = ~p ∧ ~q

A tautology is a statement form that is always true regardless of th truth value
of the individual statement substituted for its statement variables.
A contradiction is a statement form that is always false.

2.2 Conditional statements
--------------------------

Let p and q be statements. A sentence of the form "if p then p" is denotes
symbolically by "p -> q" ; p is called the hypothesis and q is called the
conclusion.

    p -> q ≡ ~p ∨ q

Biconditional of p and q is "p if, and only if, q"
    p <-> q

2.3 Valid and invalid arguments
-------------------------------

A fallacy is an error in reasoning that results in an invalid argument.

3. The logic of quantified statements
=====================================

In grammar, the word pridicate refers to the part of a sentence that gives
information about the subject.

    ∀ is called the universal quantifier = for every, for any
    ∃ is called the existential quntifier 
    
    
4. Elementary number theory and methods of proof
================================================

An integer n is even if, and only if, n equals twice some integer.
An integer n is odd  if, and only if, n equals twice some integer plus 1.

5. Sequences, mathematical induction, and recursion.
====================================================

One of the most important tasks of methematics is to discover and characterize
regular patterns, such as those associated with processes that are repeated.

Sequence - repeated processes.
The main mathematical tool used to verify conjectures about sequences is
mathematical induction.


A sequence is a function whose domain is either all the integers between two
given integers or all the integers greater than or equal to given integer.

   a_m, a_m+1, a_m+2, ..., a_n.

   a_k read "a sub k" : a_k is called a term, k is called a subscript, or index
   
Lagrange introduced the capital Greek letter sigma, ∑

  n
  ∑ a_k  - read the summation from k equals m to n of a-sub-k
 k=m

  n
  ∑ a_k  = a_m + a_m+1 + a_m+2 + ... + a_n
 k=m

k - the index of the summation, m the lower limit of the summation, and n the
upper limit of the summation.

The notation for the product of a sequence of numbers is analogous to the
notation sum. The Greek capital letter pi, ∏, denotes a product.

  n
  ∏ a_k = a_m ∙ a_m+1 ∙ a_m+2 ... a_n - product from k equals m to n a-sub-k.
 k=m
 
Properties of summations and products:

  n          n         n
  ∑ a_k  +   ∑ b_k  =  ∑ (a_k + b_k)
 k=m        k=m       k=m

     n        n
 c ∙ ∑ a_k =  ∑ c ∙ a_k
    k=m      k=m
    
  n          n         n
  ∏ a_k  ∙   ∏ b_k  =  ∏ (a_k ∙ b_k)
 k=m        k=m       k=m


n Factorial denoted n! = n ∙ (n - 1) ∙∙∙ 3 ∙ 2 ∙ 1

0! = 1

Resursive definition for factorial:

 n! = 1 if n = 0
 n! = n ∙ (n - 1)!

"n choose r" 
 
  / n \        n!
 ||   ||  = ---------- - C = combinations (binomial coefficients).
  \ r /      r!(n-r)!

6. Set theory
==============

Let S denote a set and a - an element of S.
 a ∈ S means that a is an element of S
 a ∉ S means that a is not an element of S
 
        A = { x ∈ S | P(x) }   | means "such that"
        A is the set of all x in S such that P of x.

        A ⊆ B <-> ∀x, if x ∈ S then x ∈ B.
        A ⊈ B <-> ∃x such that x ∈ A and x ∉ B

        A is proper subset of B <-> A ⊆ B and ∃x such that x ∈ B and x ∉ A

        A = B <-> A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A

        A ∨ B  = union
        A ∧ B  = intersection
        A - B  = difference 
        !A     = complement
        
            ∅         = empty (null) else

        A ∧ B  = ∅  - disjoint

        P(A) - power set of A is the set of all subsets of A
        
        P({x, y}) = {∅, {x}, {y}, {x, y}}
