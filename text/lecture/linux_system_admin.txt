The Free software movement came about in the 1980s as a response to the proliferation
of proprietary and restricted software.
The movement's philosophy is that the computer computers and software not prevent
cooperation between users, and instead have the goal of liberating everyone in
cyberspace.
Users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software.
