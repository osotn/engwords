What is Linux?
- Linux is the kernel that powers a Linux Operating System.
- Kernels are programs that talk directly to the hardware and manage resources and process
- Kernels need a whole operating system to be useful
- When a Linux Kernel is bundled with operating system software and shipped together, 
  that is called a Linux Distribution.

Linux Distributions
 - Red Hat Family
 - Debian Family
 - Source Code Distributions
 - System V Init vs SystemD

Hardware Considerations
 - Can you machine boot the installation media?
 - How much hard drive space do you need?
 - How much RAM do you need?
 - Will your video card work?
 - Will your wireless card work?
 - What other hardware needs to work?
