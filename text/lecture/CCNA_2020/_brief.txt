Day 1
Network Devices

A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.

* router
* switch
* firewall
* server
* client

A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server.

A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients.

Client --- The Internet --- Server

Switches:
    - Cisco Catalyst 9200
    - Cisco Catalyst 3650

Switches:
    - have many network interfaces / ports for end hosts to connect to (usually 24+)
    - provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN
    - do not provide connectivity between LANs / over the Internet

Routers:
    - ISR 1000
    - ISR 900
    - ISR 4000

Routers:
    - have fewer network interfaces than switches
    - are used to provide connectivity between LANs
    - are therefore used to send data over the Internet

Firewalls
    - ASA5500-X
    - Firepower 2100

    - monitor and control network traffic based on configure rules.
    - can be placed 'inside' the network, or 'outside the network'.
    - are known as "next generation firewalls" when they include more modern
        and advanced filtering capabilities.

Network firewalls:
    - are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks
Host based firewalls:
    - are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host
        machine, like a PC

Day 2
Interfaces and Cables

10/100/1000Base-T Ports (1-24) - Ports are Auto-MDIX
RJ-45 = Registered Jack

Ethernet is a collection of network protocols / standards.

Speed is measured in bits per second (kbps, Mbps, Gbps, etc)


Ethernet copper

Ethernet         10   Mbps  =   10BASE-T  100m        T = twisted pair
Fast Ethernet    100  Mbps  =  100BASE-T  100m
Gigabit Ethernet 1000 Mbps  = 1000BASE-T  100m
10 Gig Ethernet  10   Gbps  =  10GBASE-T  100m


UTP Cables = Unshielded Twisted Pair

Full-Duplex

Straight through cable
Crossover        cable

Auto MDI-X (Medium dependent interface crossover)

               MDI        MDI-X      Auto MDI-X
MDI         crossover    straight       any
MDI-X       straight     crossover      any
Auto MDI-X     any         any          any


MDI:    1/2 Tx, 3/6 Rx  = NIC, Router, Firewall
MDI-X:  1/2 Rx, 3/6 Tx  = Hub, Switch

SFP Transceiver (small form factor pluggable)

Fiber - optic

single - mode  (SM)      = longer, core diameter is narrower, expensive (laser based transmitter)
multi    mode (MM)      = core diameter is wider than single - mode fiber, cheaper (LED - based)

1    Gbps  = 1000BASE-LX  550m (MM) / 5km (SM)
10   Gbps  =  10GBASE-SR  400m (MM)
10   Gbps  =  10GBASE-LR  10km (SM)
10   Gbps  =  10GBASE-ER  30km (SM)


EMI (eletromagnetic interference)
vulnerable to EMI

Emit (leak) a faint signal outside of the cable


Day 3. OSI Model & TCP/IP Suite
-------------------------------

Networking models categorize and provide a structure for networking protocols
and standards.

Protocol is a set of rules defining how network devices and software should work.

OSI = Open Systems Interconnection' model by ISO

    7. Application    - HTTP
    6. Presentation   - 
    5. Session
    4. Transport
    3. Network
    2. Data Link
    1. Physical Layer

Encapsulation and de-encapsulation

Same layer interaction

Data in the application layer is in 'application format'
It needs to be translated to a different format to be sent over
the network.
The presentation Layer job is to translate between application
and network formats.

Session layer controls dialogues (sessions) between communicating hosts.

L4 Transport - Segment = L4 Header + Data;
L3 Network   - Packet  = L3 Header + Segment
L2 Data Link - Frame   = L2 Header + Packet + L2 Trailer

PDUs: data, segment, packet, frame
(protocol Data Units)

A  All                                                                Acronyms
P     People                                                 Pointless
S           Seem                                     Students
T               To                              Teach
N                 Need                       Not
D                     Data                 Do
P                         Processing Please
