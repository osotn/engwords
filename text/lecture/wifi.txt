802.11 Wireless Networks
========================

The most obvious advantage of wireless networking is mobility.

Base station = access points.

Wireless. In a certain frequency band.
Each band has an associated bandwidth, which is simply the amount of frequency
space in the band.
Radio spectrum controlled by licensing. FCC - US.

ISM = Industrial, Scientific, and Medical.

The most familiar ISM-band is the microwave oven, which operates within the 2.4 GHz
ISM (ai-es-em) band => effective for heating water.
802.11a device in 5GHz band.
ISM bands are generally license 

MAC = media access control - 48 bit.

802 IEEE family.

CSMA/CD = Carrier Sense Multiple Access network with Collision Detection.

LLC = Logical Link Control.

Chapter 3. 802.11 MAC Fundamentals

Differences between the wireless network environment and the traditional wired
environment create challenges for network protocol designers.

On a wired Ethernet, it is reasonable to transmit a frame and assume that the
destination receives it correctly.
Even narrowband transmissions are subject to noise and interference, but
unlicensed devices must assume that interference will exist and work around it.
The designers of 802.11 considered ways to work around the radiation from
microwave ovens and other RF sources.
802.11 Link Layer protocols incorporates positive acknowledgments.
Frame ----->
      <----- Ack

Wireless networks have fuzzier boundaries, sometimes to the point where each node
may not be able to directly communicate with every other node in the wireless netowork.

Collisions resulting from hidden nodes may be hard to detect in wireless networks
because wireless transceivers are generally half duplex; they don't transmit and
receive at the same time.
To prevent collisions, 802.11 allows stations to use Request to Send (RTS) and
Clear to Send (CTS) signals to clear out an area: RTS frame and CTS frame, data frame,
final acknowledgment.

RTS   --------------->
      <-------------- CTS
Frame --------------->
      <-------------- ACK

Uses interframe space:
    -   SIFS (Short interframe space) for highest priority transmissions, such as RTS/CTS frames, ACK. High priority transmissions can begin once the SIFS has elapsed.

Retry counters are incremented when frames are retransmitted.
