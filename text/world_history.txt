INTRODUCTION
‘The State of the World’

The choice of Beijing, capital of China, as the host city for the 2008 Olympic Games has produced an extraordinary, if brief, historic marriage of East and West. The games symbolize the world of classical Greece, whose legacy has played such an exceptional part in the development of the Western world.

Greek civilization gave the West professional medicine, geometry, ethical speculation, democracy, an ideal of participatory citizenship, codified law, the first history, a science of politics and an artistic heritage imitated again and again down the ages. Many of our common terms today—from economics to psychiatry—are Greek in origin.

China, on the other hand, is seat of the most ancient and continuous of civilizations. Always the site of the largest fraction of the world’s population, China for thousands of years, despite waves of invasions, sustained a way of life and a social structure which proved remarkably enduring. Chinese values and intellectual life were not, unlike Greek civilization, diffused widely outside the frontiers of what was loosely defined as ‘China’. Western critics in the 19th century regarded China as a stagnant culture, unmoved for centuries, but the artistic, scientific and intellectual life of China, though very different from that of the West, was rich and diverse. A good case can be made for arguing that China has been a fixed point throughout the period of recorded history, where Greek culture has been anything but continuous, relying for much of its survival on the intercession of the Arab cultures of the Middle East that succeeded the Roman Empire, in which aspects of Greek thought were kept alive and then re-exported to late medieval Europe.

The China of the 2008 Olympics is still a central part of the world story, but it has come part way to meet the West. From the late 19th century traditional Chinese society crumbled under Western impact. A nationalist revolution overthrew the emperors and the old way of life after 1911. A second communist revolution transformed China into a more modern industrial state after 1949. Over the past 25 years China has undergone a third revolutionary wave by embracing the fruits of modern global capitalism and becoming one of the world’s major economic players. China has not become an Asian ‘West’, but has adapted what the West has had to offer and has turned China into a world ‘superpower’. The relationship between East and West has come full circle. For centuries the West pushed outwards into the world exporting, usually violently, a version of Western civilization. China was long resistant to this pressure; now China can exert pressure of its own, challenging the monopoly hitherto enjoyed by the remorseless march of Western economics, political models, consumerism and popular culture.

The meeting of Greece and China weaves together two of the central threads of world history. But the Olympics are also a symbolic fusion of ancient and modern. Although the original games are far removed from the glossy, commercialized, technically sophisticated and ruinously expensive modern version, their revival is a reminder that there are easily understood reference points back to the Europe of more than 2,000 years ago. Boxing, wrestling, javelin - throwing and running are simply what they are, the same for a modern audience as they were for the Greeks. Even the marathon, the icon of the current Western obsession with keeping fit, describes a Greek legend, when a soldier runner covered 26 miles non-stop under a gruelling sun from the Battle of Marathon to Athens to warn of the approaching Persian fleet, only to drop dead from the effort on his arrival. Distant though the ancient world seems, the span of recorded human history is remarkably short in relation to the long history of prehistoric man and the infinitely longer history of the earth. The span can be covered by just a hundred human lives of 60 years, stretched out one after the other. Only 50 human lives will take you back to those first Olympic Games.

To think about the past as something connected by a continuous thread of human activity runs the danger of imposing a false sense of unity, but for much of the earth’s surface, over long periods of time, fundamental change has been absent. Anthropological evidence has for a long time been able to describe practices and beliefs that are clearly connected with a world so distant that it has been transmuted into myth. One hundred human lives laid end-to-end is not very many. To put it another way: it is possible to house an artefact from every major civilization of the past 5,000 years in a single cabinet and to recognize that until the last few hundred years those artefacts—whether a pot, a fertility doll, an arrow - head, a shoe, a coin — bear a remarkable underlying similarity. The recorded history of the world can be read at one level as a unitary experience, a brief 4 percent of the time modern hominids have been evolving, a hundred human lives.

Of course these lives were not the same wherever they were lived. Whatever homologies can be detected between peoples and civilizations, the experience of world history over the past 6,000 years is a series of fractured narratives, divided geographically and segmented by differing cultures, religious practices and political orders. The whole course of world history has been a process of cultural exchange and discovery, of imperial expansion and decline; sometimes links once made were then ruptured again; at other times communication enriched both cultures. In the past 500 years that process of discovering, mapping and understanding the world as a whole has accelerated, but for most previous civilizations the ‘known world’ was only what was immediately known. The modern concept of ‘world history’ which this book encapsulates was meaningless to most human civilizations through most of human history. For large areas of the globe there was no written culture so that ‘history’ survived as myth or folk memory, dating was arbitrary or non-existent, and the world was circumscribed by the very limited geographical reach of particular peoples. Rome was an exception, but even for Romans the known world was centred on the Mediterranean and the barbarous (meaning alien) outside was scarcely understood or valued. China for centuries regarded itself as the centre of the universe, and the outside world, to the extent that it intruded at all, was supposed to revolve like so many blighted planets around the Chinese sun. The history of the world is a very Western idea and it has become knowable only in the last century or so as Europeans and their descendants overseas produced sophisticated archaeological techniques and scholarly skills to unlock many of the remaining secrets of the past. When the English novelist H. G. Wells wrote his famous Outline of History, published in 1920, he was able to do so only on the foundation of an outpouring of new research in the last decades of the 19th century. Wells was preoccupied, he wrote in his introduction, with ‘history as one whole’, and he was one of the first to attempt it.


The more that came to be known about the many civilizations and cultures that made up human history, the more tempting it was, like Wells, to try to see history as a whole and to explain the process of historical change as a uniform one. This ambition had roots in the 19th century, where it was famously attempted by the German thinkers Georg Hegel and his erstwhile disciple Karl Marx, who both suggested that historical change was dynamic, the result of shifting patterns of thought or the transition from one economic system to another, each stage of human development incorporating the best from the past but each an advance on the one before it, until humankind finally reached an ideal society. The 19th-century view, coloured by the remarkable technical progress of the age, was to try to see a purpose behind historical change—not a mere random set of events, or a set of parables or myths to educate the present, but a triumphant account of the ascent of man. Neither Hegel nor Marx was a historian, and they both regarded China as a backwater that had somehow failed to move like the rest of the world. The 20th century witnessed more historically sophisticated attempts to find a unity in world history. The German philosopher Oswald Spengler published just after the First World War two volumes of an ambitious study of the pattern of all world history. Each civilization, Spengler argued, had a natural life-cycle, like any organism, of birth, growth, maturity and death, a run of approximately 1,000 years each. He called his volumes The Decline of the West in order to argue against the optimism of the previous century and to demonstrate that Western civilization, for all its belief that it represented the full flowering of human history, was doomed to go the way of the rest. The British historian Arnold Toynbee thought Spengler’s view of history too schematic, but he produced 10 volumes of A Study of History between 1934 and 1954 in which he too detected a common pattern in all previous civilizations which explained their birth, rise to cultural fruition and eventual collapse. Both Spengler and Toynbee rejected the idea that the purpose of history was the triumph of the West, but they both thought that history could be understood as a single, repeated pattern, from ancient Egypt to the modern West.

Few historians now accept that world history works like this. The rise and fall of civilizations evidently has causes, many of which are explored in the pages that follow. But it does not follow from this that history ought to progress, or that it follows internal laws or patterns of development. History does not move forward entirely blindly, but its progress is more often than not accidental, not patterned, and the circumstances of its development contingent rather than purposive—a product of a particular set of circumstances at a particular time rather than a necessary progress from one stage to the next. The same objection can be raised to the popular idea that there are turning points in history, key battles or events that have determined the course of history. Some events are clearly more important than others. History might now be written differently if the Roman army had not defeated Hannibal at Zama in 202 BC, but this was just one event in a much wider world of human activity, insignificant in India or China of the 3rd century BC. On balance human history moves forward on a broad front, less affected by ‘turning points’ than might be expected. If one set of events had never happened, there would just be a different narrative which would now be accepted as part of the past as readily as any other. History has neither pattern nor purpose. It is simply the record of what has been.

There are nonetheless broad common factors that have shaped the development of human communities wherever they have settled. The most important element has been the continuous and complex relationship between mankind and the natural world. Natural phenomena have defined a great deal of the human story. Until quite recently most natural forces were beyond human capacity to control or mediate or even to understand. Some still remain so. In the spring of 2008 a ferocious cyclone, which laid waste large parts of southern Myanmar, and a powerful earthquake in China, killed at least 150,000 people between them. Natural disasters—earthquakes, tidal waves, volcanic eruptions, soil erosion, rising sea levels, crop failure—have been a constant feature of all history. The shaping of the landscape determined patterns of settlement, forms of husbandry, the possibility of exploration and trade. The seas and rivers have been both barrier and pathway. The siting of cities, artificial additions to the landscape, has been determined by access to river communications, or the existence of a natural harbour, or the natural defensive walls provided by high outcrops of rock or hillside. For the past 5,000 years and the introduction of widespread agriculture, the relationship between population size and food supply has added a further natural factor restricting or enhancing the prospects of particular societies, or creating violent tensions between communities that lived by hunting and those with settled pastoral traditions. This competition is not confined to the ancient past, when, for example, waves of hunters from the plains of Eurasia descended on Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries; the near extermination of the North American buffalo in the 19th century by white hunters, an animal on which some Native American tribal societies depended, opened the way for the vast grain - growing prairie belt and the emasculation of the Native American population.


The supply of food, or its absence, famine, is a constant through human history. It exercised the ancient Egyptians, who developed complex irrigation systems to compensate for a buoyant population surrounded by desert; 3,000 years later Adolf Hitler argued that Germans needed ‘living space’ in Eastern Europe to provide a proper balance between population and food supply; the contemporary world, trying to support a vastly greater population, witnesses famines in Africa side-by-side with an overabundance of food in the richer West. A new food crisis in 2008 has prompted the bleak conclusion that food output must expand 50 per cent by 2030 to meet demand. For most people through most of recorded history the search for food has been unyielding. In hunting communities, as long as there existed a wealth of animal life or fish, food was not a problem. In settled, agricultural communities, on the other hand, the supply of food was restricted either by problems of soil or changeable climate or by the maldistribution of food between rich and poor, or both. Tilling the soil was no guarantee of a decent diet; a Roman feast or a groaning Victorian banquet gives no clue as to how inadequate was the food supply for the slaves who grew and garnered it in Roman Italy, or for the Victorian poor, most of them cut off from the land and dependent on a monotonous starch - rich diet. In post - Renaissance Italy there developed one of the most sophisticated cuisines in the world, informed by a wealth of gastronomic master - works, but the later peasant workers of the Po Valley suffered debilitating pellagra from eating a stodgy maize - based diet that inflated their abdomens and eventually killed them. In settled civilizations, an adequate, varied, artistically presented or innovative diet was the preserve of the rich. It was no accident that the Russian Revolution of February 1917 began with a demonstration for bread by hungry women in St Petersburg (Petrograd).

The relationship between mankind and environment has changed a good deal over the past 200 years. Larger and more regular food supplies together with changes in healthcare have provoked a population explosion. Global population was around 800 million in the 18th century; currently it is an astonishing 6.7 billion. A result has been the massive expansion of the agricultural base, partly from utilising virgin lands, partly from raising yields artificially through plant- and stock-breeding or the addition of chemical fertiliser. These changes have provoked deforestation and the transformation of natural habitat. Heavy hunting has brought thousands of land and sea creatures to the edge of extinction. The world’s urban population has grown dramatically since 1900 and now stands at just over 50 per cent of the whole, producing huge sprawling cities and high levels of human pollution. To meet the daily needs of such a population has meant expanding industrial production, depleting the earth’s natural resources, and creating a growing chemical imbalance in the atmosphere that has damaged the ozone layer and threatens through so-called ‘global warming’ to undermine the fragile basis on which 6 billion people can subsist. Demands for a higher living standard from Western populations already rich in resources, and for catch-up living standards in much of the rest of the world, has accelerated the depletion of resources, the transformation of the landscape and the unnatural climate change. The rich United States has 5 per cent of the world’s population but generates annually 25 per cent of the ‘greenhouse gases’ that cause climate change. The most alarming scenarios are now painted of the capacity of man to forge new natural disasters to which there will be no answer—enough methane gas perhaps to cause a global explosion in a century’s time, or the release of bacteria from the frozen icecaps millions of years old, from which current populations would have no prospect of immunity. The relationship between man and nature has about it a profound irony. The attempt to master the natural world has simply given nature new and more terrible powers.

Only in one respect has it proved possible to tame nature sufficiently to alter human society for the good. Over the past 150 years, in itself a fraction of the long history of man, it has proved possible to understand and then prevent or cure most medical conditions. For all the rest of human history, disease and disability were an ever - present reality for which there was almost no effective relief. The establishment of cities and animal husbandry combined to create ideal conditions for the establishment of a cluster of endemic epidemic diseases which periodically killed off wide swathes of the human host. The earliest epidemics in the cities of the first civilizations in China, Egypt or Mesopotamia included smallpox, diphtheria, influenza, chickenpox and mumps. With the opening of trade routes and regular invasions, disease could be spread from populations that had developed some immunity to those biologically vulnerable. Athens was struck by a devastating plague in 430 BC which undermined its political power; the Antonine plague in the late-2nd-century AD Roman Empire killed around one-quarter of the populations it infected, probably with smallpox. Bubonic plague, transmitted by fleas carried on rats, killed around two-thirds of its victims. Plague originating in Egypt in 540 AD spread to the Eastern Mediterranean where again one-quarter of the population died. The famous Black Death in the 14th century swept from Asia to Europe, killing an estimated 20 million and reducing Europe’s population by one-quarter. Epidemics died out partly because the pathogens had no other victims to kill. Modernity was no safeguard either. Cholera coincided with the industrialization and urbanization of Europe and produced regular pandemics in Asia, the Middle East and Europe between the 1820s and the 1890s. ‘Spanish influenza’ struck Europe at the end of the First World War with populations unnaturally weakened by lack of food; it was the world’s worst pandemic, killing 60 million people in just two years.

The attempt to understand and explain the nature of disease, and if possible cure it, goes back to the very earliest periods of recorded history. Classic Chinese medicine (now usually described as Traditional Chinese Medicine or TCM) is thought to date back almost 5,000 years. The standard text on ‘Basic Questions of Internal Medicine’ (known as Neijing Suwen) was written, according to legend, by the Yellow Emperor around 2,600 BC; the earliest surviving version dates from at least 2,000 years ago. Early Chinese medicine was rooted in a broader philosophical system based in one case on Confucianism, in the second on Taoism. Confucianism rejected the idea of anatomical or surgical invasion in the belief that the body was sacred; instead the use of acupuncture or massage was preferred, influencing internal disease by external means. Taoism saw health related entirely to achieving harmony between the different elements of the world, the Yin and the Yang. Disease was a consequence of lack of harmony. Chinese medicine focused on herbal remedies and acupuncture as means to restore that harmony rather than more violent medical intervention. Close observation of morbid symptoms was regarded as essential to understand what combination of remedies was needed. During the brief Sui dynasty (581–618 AD) a group of doctors composed The General Treatise on the Causes and Symptoms of Disease which comprised 50 volumes and described some 1,700 conditions. The classic texts retained an enduring influence down to the 20th century when successive modernising regimes tried to substitute Western medicine with only limited success.

The other classic tradition arose in Greece from the 5th century BC based on the teachings of the secular theorist Hippocrates, born around 460, whose famous ‘oath’, that doctors should at the least do no harm, is still sworn by Western doctors today. Like Chinese medicine, Greek medicine relied on explaining disease as an absence of harmony in the body between four elements or ‘humours’ that composed it. The elements were blood, choler (yellow bile), phlegm and black bile. These humours corresponded to the elements identified by Greek science as universal components—air (blood), fire (choler), water (phlegm) and earth (black bile). Cure for any imbalance was based on a range of options—bleeding, diet, exercise and occasional surgery. These views, revived in medieval Europe, exercised a continuing influence down to the time when modern medical science made its first appearance in the European Renaissance, and even beyond it. The problem for Greek as for Chinese medicine was the strong prejudice against direct anatomical research on human cadavers. In all pre-scientific medical systems an absence of proper understanding of the function of the body and the cause of disease meant that cures were largely accidental. Recent tests on 200 Chinese traditional herbal remedies for malaria found that only one, by chance, contained anything that might contribute to a cure.

Only the onset of serious research on how the body worked—perhaps the most famous example was William Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the blood, published in 1628—made it possible to understand how the body was affected by particular conditions and to suggest prophylaxis. Even then the growing understanding of the body did little to help prevent epidemics until the onset of vaccination (introduced in late-18th-century Britain for smallpox) and the path-breaking research of the French chemist, Louis Pasteur, and the German doctor Robert Koch, which by the 1880s had confirmed that disease was caused by bacteria, each different micro - organism responsible for a particular disease. The discovery of antibiotic properties in penicillin mould in 1928 completed the therapeutic revolution. From the mid-19th century onwards the older medical traditions, which had limited or no medical efficacy, were superseded by a science - based medicine which has pushed the frontiers of biochemistry, neurology, physiology and pharmacology almost to their limits and has, at least temporarily, conquered almost all known diseases and a large number of internal medical disorders.

Only the identification of the HIV virus in the 1980s, which attacks the body’s immune system, made it clear that even the most scientifically advanced medicine may not in the future be able to stem new and unexpected forms of epidemic. For the fortunate few generations in the West who have been the full beneficiaries of the medical revolution, the transformation has been extraordinary. For all the rest of recorded human history there was no effective cure for most diseases and humans survived only because of a complex struggle between the micro - organisms and the human immune system. Death was ever - present and social attitudes and religious beliefs had to be rooted in the expectation of high levels of mortality. For those who survived there were disfiguring illnesses, crippling medical conditions, poor eyesight, chronic toothache, and so on. For women throughout history there was the debilitating cycle of births and the ever-present risk of maternal death. Pain, like premature death, was a permanent visitor.

To make matters worse, throughout human history both death and pain have been inflicted unnaturally, the product of deliberate violence on the part of human communities. Man, and almost always the male of the species, is a uniquely aggressive and punitive creature. Although attempts have been made over the past century to demonstrate that other animal species indulge in deliberate violence, animal violence is instinctive, not conscious. Mankind, on the other hand, has throughout recorded history, and evidently long before that, been able to premeditate the use of violence directed at other humans. Some anthropologists, following the 18th-century French philosopher Jean - Jacques Rousseau, have tried to argue that early man was most likely peaceable, and that only the tensions generated by more complex forms of social life introduced higher levels of violence. But the range and sophistication of pre-historic weapons, first stone, then iron and bronze, makes the idea of a pacific prehistoric state implausible. It is of course true that with settled communities, centred on cities, violence came to be organized through the use of armies. The evolution of a specialized human function for organising and legitimating the use of violence is evident in the very earliest recorded history. The soldier, armed with an ever more lethal armoury, runs in an unbroken line from all corners of the ancient world where complex civilizations arose. In tribal communities, without settled urban life, inter - tribal and intra - tribal violence was often ritualized, the young males of the tribe using violence as a rite of passage or a sacred obligation.

There is no single answer to the question of why violence should be such a hallmark of world history, but it can be found on almost every page. The German legal theorist Carl Schmitt, writing in the 1920s, claimed that the human community has always been divided between ‘friend’ and ‘foe’, those who are included in the group and those who are excluded. Simplistic though the distinction might seem, the concept of the alien, the other, the barbarian, the enemy, or the excluded also runs as a thread through all history. Treatment of the ‘other’ has always been harsh, even in the modern age with its vain efforts to impose some kind of restraints or norms on military behaviour and state violence. Yet even this distinction leaves a great deal unexplained. Human beings do not just fight each other in pitched battles using soldiers who know what to expect. They punish human victims in hideously painful and savage ways. Coercive social relationships have been far more common than consensual ones. Victims, even those from among ‘the included’ who are guilty of crime, have been tortured, executed, beaten, imprisoned in ways so ingeniously atrocious and gratuitously cruel that it is difficult not to assume that violence is the normal human condition and the very recent and limited experience of peace and respect for the individual a merciful historical anomaly. Violence is also universal, not some characteristic of ‘savage society’ as self-righteous Victorian imperialists like to think. Civilizations, however sophisticated, have indulged in violence of every kind. Religions have often led the way in devising grotesque ways to seek out heresies and exorcize devils. At the Museum of Torture Instruments in Guadalest in Spain (by no means the only such museum) are displayed roomfuls of fearful devices designed to extract confessions from across early-modern Europe, including the unhappy victims of the notorious Spanish Inquisition—iron crowns with spikes which tighten around the victim’s head, sharp stakes that could impale the whole length of a human body without killing the victim immediately. Human beings have devoted a deplorable amount of effort to inflicting suffering, and seem to have done so with few moral qualms.

There have been many attempts to explain why wars happen, or why human history is so soaked in blood. There is no single concept of war (though there is ‘warfare’, the art of fighting) that can embrace all the many forms of war or the thousands of separate historical reasons why particular wars break out, evident from the pages that follow. Early - 20th - century anthropologists were inclined to argue that war might have had some important function in primitive societies or in the age of early state formation but they could see no justification for it in the modern age. The idea that war, and other forms of violence, were a throwback to a past age now thinly papered over with ‘civilization’ was urged by the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud when he reflected on the reasons for the prolonged and deadly fighting in the First World War: ‘the primitive, savage and evil impulses of mankind have not vanished in any individual, but continue their existence, although in a repressed state’. Freud thought war rapidly exposed the savage persona inside and later argued that the more ‘civilized’ a people became, the more likely it was that the dam of repression would burst and uncontrollable violence result.

Whether this really is the mechanism that releases violence, Freud proved all too right in his prediction. In the late 19th century it was still just possible to imagine that the barbarities of earlier history, when cities were sacked, their populations put to the sword, fine buildings burned, was a thing of the past (though this did not prevent European troops on a punitive expedition from destroying the stunning Summer Palace in Beijing in 1860, an act of wanton vandalism that witnesses compared with the sack of Rome by the Goths). But the 20th century has been the bloodiest in all of human history, witness to somewhere between 85 and 100 million violent deaths, and millions more wounded, maimed, tortured, raped and dispossessed. It includes the deliberate murder of the European Jews which must rank with anything else in scale and horror from the past 6,000 years. It will be difficult for historians in a few hundred years’ time to see what separates the Mongol sack of Samarkand in 1220, which left only a few of the inhabitants alive, from the Allies’ destruction of Hamburg in 1943, which burnt the city to the ground and killed 40,000 people in hideous ways in just two days. The second was, of course, quicker and more efficient, but the moral defence usually mounted, that war is war, is a maxim as comprehensible in the ancient world as it would have been to Genghis Khan or Napoleon. So-called civilization displays precisely Freud’s divided self—capable of self-restraint and social progress, but capable of sudden lapses into barbarism.

The impact of famine, disease and war on human history was famously illustrated by the English 18th-century clergyman, Thomas Malthus, who argued in his Essay on the Principle of Population, published in 1798, that throughout history the dangers of overpopulation were always checked by the operation of these three elements. It is tempting to turn this argument on its head and wonder how it is that the human species survived at all under the multiple assault of violence, hunger and epidemic but it took another English biologist, Charles Darwin, with the publication of The Origin of Species in 1859, to explain that species survived through natural selection. The survival of Homo sapiens was thus biologically explicable; the stronger survived, the weaker perished. In a crude sense that was true, and for decades thereafter it was assumed that harsh though the realities of history had been, they had been necessary hardships to produce a biologically and intellectually progressive species. Both writers have in the end been confounded by a further paradox of the modern age: population has risen to levels often predicted as insupportable, but growth has scarcely been dented by the incidence of disease or violence or hunger, while natural selection has been overturned by modern medicine and welfare policies. The most violent and deadly century has at the same time been the century with the highest survival rates.

Grim though the past has often been, history has not been an unmediated story of suffering borne by an uncomprehending and victimized humanity. From the very earliest times human societies needed to make sense of the chaos and dangers around them, or to justify the hardships they faced, or the reality of unpredictable or premature death or to find some wider moral universe which sanctioned acceptable forms of behaviour and penalized others. Religion was able to satisfy all these needs and religious beliefs, like warfare, have been a constant for at least six millennia. Consideration of religion raises awkward questions about the nature of ‘world history’ because for most human societies through most of time, the material world described by modern historians has only been one part of the universe of human experience. Religious communities are connected to other unseen states and unknowable sites which have been, and for many still are, as profound a part of reality as the political structures and economic systems of the visible world. Belief in a world of spirits or an afterlife, or in unseen and divine guardians, or in a sublime universal ‘other’ has made historical experience multi - dimensional, natural as well as supernatural. For medieval Christians the world was one link in a complex chain between heaven and hell, which included the nether world of purgatory where souls were left to wait entry to paradise. For ancient Egyptians the other world was so real that kings talked and walked with the gods, and when they died took with them their household, animals, and furnishings. So widespread was the belief that the dead, or at least the kings, nobles and priests, needed to take possessions with them beyond the grave that modern knowledge of past cultures has been enormously expanded by the votive offerings and funerary furnishings found in excavated graves.

Belief in the supernatural, the divine, a world of the spirit, the reality of a soul that could live on beyond the decay of the earthly body, magic, superstition and witchcraft created for the inhabitants of all but the most recent communities a sphere of experience that was always larger than the material world around them. Belief was used to explain the apparently inexplicable, to ward off evil, to promote well-being, induce harmony of being and to prepare the mortal body for the world or worlds to come. The link with a world beyond mere physical observation has proved remarkably enduring, even in the secular, liberal West. In southern Italy images of saints and the Madonna are still carried through villages to offer protection against floods or volcanic eruptions or to encourage rainfall. The concept of ‘the Limbo of the Infants’, introduced as a term by the Catholic Church around 1300 to describe a haven for the souls of babies who died before there was time for baptism, in which they enjoyed a natural happiness, but were denied access to heaven, was all but set aside in 2007 when the Church announced that unbaptized infants should be entrusted to the possible mercy of God. Protests from parents anxious that their dead children should have a sure destination forced the Church to admit that Limbo was still a possibility. All attempts to provide a secular alternative to traditional Islam have foundered on the continuing vitality of the values and practices of the faith which is bound to a world beyond this one. Suicide bombers are recruited on the promise that they will be welcomed at once by the souls of the faithful when they cross the threshold of death.

Religions of every kind have exerted an extraordinary psychological power. This has been served in a number of ways. For thousands of years the finest buildings and monuments have been dedicated to religious purposes; in tribal societies the sacred—totems, ancestral graveyards—have exerted powerful fears and provoked an instinctive reverence. The numerous cathedrals, mosques and temples built in Christian, Islamic and Buddhist communities from medieval times onwards as gateways to the divine are among the richest architecture in the world, constructed in societies where for the poor the monumental buildings were awe-inspiring expressions of the spiritual. Religions were also the source of sanctioned behaviour. The rules laid down for social practice, custom, family life, or sexual conduct, are almost all religious in origin. A great many religions have been vehicles for constructing a male - centred society in which women were compelled to accept an ascribed and restricted gender role or risk severe forms of punishment or social discrimination. Many moral codes or legal systems were constructed by lay authorities—for example, Justinian’s Codex, or the Code Napoleon—but they relied on a conception of acceptable behaviour that was derived from the core moral teaching of the Church. In traditional Islam there should ideally be no distinction between religious precept and state law. In early Chinese history the emperors were accorded divine status, making the law, but making it as gods. In Japanese society, where the emperors also enjoyed quasi - divine status, to die willingly for the emperor was a moral obligation that overrode all others.

Religious belief was always difficult to challenge because the threat that unbelief or heresy posed was a threat to an entire way of viewing the world. For a great many communities governed by animist or polytheistic systems of belief there were no reasons, and usually no means, for questioning the ground in which such belief was rooted. There was no question of earning salvation, but simply obeying the customary rites and endorsing the beliefs of a given system. Monotheistic religions, in which respect for the deity and reverence for doctrine earned the right to salvation, were altogether more problematic. Arguments about Christian doctrine brought regular schism, provoking the rift between Orthodox Christianity in Eastern Europe and Western Catholic Christianity in 1054, and further schism between Catholic and Protestant Christianity in the 16th century. Fear of heterodoxy, or of the diabolical, provoked Catholicism into regular heresy hunts and the extraction of confessions through torture. Protestant and Catholic were burnt at the stake for their faith in the struggle over the Reformation. Radical Protestantism was also fearful of idolatry or witchcraft and the last witches were famously burnt in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692. Islam was also schismatic. In 680 AD the faith divided between Sunni and Shiite sects over disagreements on doctrine (including the Shia insistence that Allah could take human form), and the two branches are still engaged in violent confrontation throughout the Middle East. Convinced of the rightness of their cause, monotheistic religions enjoy a strong imperative to convert; those outside the pale, regarded as pagans or infidels, are damned. Conversion was seen as an obligation, part of God’s purpose to ensure that among the many competing claims to a divine order only one could be the right one.

To claim no religious allegiance has been a recent and limited option, confined largely to the Western world. Atheism became publicly admissible in the 19th century without fear of punishment but the public denial of God still attracts outrage. Secularists over the past two centuries have been keen to separate Church and state, but have not necessarily been irreligious. The strident rejection of the supernatural was identified with 19th-century socialism whose world view was materialist. Atheism appealed to a progressive intelligentsia hostile to what they saw as stale Christian convention. When the German poet - philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously announced in Thus Spake Zarathustra, published in 1888, that ‘God is dead!’, he challenged what he saw as the great lie, dating back 2,000 years, and found a limited intellectual audience more than willing to accept a godless reality. In the early 20th century atheism was formally adopted by the Soviet Union, and communist China after 1949, but in neither case was it possible to eradicate belief. Atheism is now widely regarded as a declining intellectual force in an age of religious revivalism. The wide popular hostility to Richard Dawkins’s recently published The God Delusion (2006) is testament to how necessary it is even for societies where church attendance is moribund that the material world is not just all there is.

For much of recorded history what was known or believed to be knowable was bound up with religion. Religious institutions and the priesthood were the depositories of knowledge passed down, like the famous Jewish Talmud, from generation to generation. The earliest work of ‘wisdom literature’ in ancient Egypt, perhaps in the world, was attributed to Imhotep, high priest of Heliopolis under Djoser, king between 2,654 and 2,635 BC. Religious buildings housed valuable manuscripts, not only sacred books but treatises on many subjects. During the early Christian era in Europe, in what use to be known as the ‘Dark Ages’, monasteries and churches kept alive traditions of teaching, writing and recording. The Venerable Bede, based at the monastery in Wearmouth-Jarrow in the north-east of England in the early 8th century, helped to collect together an estimated 300–500 volumes, one of the largest libraries of books in the then Western world. Western education was dominated by the Church until the 18th century. Knowledge of this kind was limited in several ways. First, it was confined to a very small elite who could read and write. A distinct literary or official language was developed which could be fully understood only by the favoured few. Although the earliest writing can be dated back to the Sumerian civilization in present-day Iraq around 5,000 years ago, and then appearing in Egypt and China, the overwhelming majority of all humans who lived between then and the last few centuries were illiterate. Knowledge for them was limited to what could be conveyed orally, or crudely illustrated. For most people information was passed on through rumour, superstition, ritual, songs, sagas and folk tales. Second, it was limited by the theological or philosophical priorities of those who held the key to knowledge, reinforcing existing views of the known world, or of man’s relation to the universe, or of social hierarchy. Knowledge was used instrumentally, rather than for its own sake, confirming the existing order rather than encouraging critical or subversive discourse.

Knowledge in this sense did not inhibit technique. From the earliest settled communities onwards rapid strides were made in the practical skills associated with metallurgy, construction, irrigation, sculpture, and the production of artefacts of often stunning originality and beauty. The contrast between the last 6,000 years and the previous tens of thousands of years is remarkable. Early man made painfully slow progress in the development of sophisticated tools of stone or bone; humans in settled communities, with a division of labour and access to trade, could transfer technologies or fashions in a matter of years. By the time of the late Roman Empire, as any visit to a museum of classical archaeology will confirm, the range and sophistication of everything from daily products to major pieces of engineering was as advanced as anything that could be found for another thousand years. Practical skill was not, nevertheless, knowledge. Understanding of the natural world, like understanding of the supernatural, was conditional. It was possible to build the most technically remarkable and artistically splendid cathedral but still to believe that the earth was flat and hell really existed.

The development of a critical, sceptical, speculative science that did not endorse existing beliefs but deliberately undermined them, was a historical development of exceptional importance. The foundations of a speculative intellectual life were to be found in ancient Greece, whose philosophers, poets and playwrights produced work of real originality whose central concerns, despite the passage of 2,000 years, engaged the enthusiasm of educated Europeans when the classics were rediscovered in the late medieval period. Nineteenth - century intellectuals could write as if little separated their age from that of Plato or Aristotle or Aeschylus. The critical breakthrough in understanding the nature of material reality by thinking critically about accepted world-views was begun, however, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and associated mainly with the rise of a body of experimental or deductive science based on close observation. The key names are well-known. The Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus dared to argue that the earth revolved around the sun in a book only published the year of his death, in 1543; the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei extended these observations and in many other ways paved the way for much modern physical science, utilising recent developments in the mechanical sciences; the Englishman Thomas Hobbes laid the foundations of modern political science and human psychology in his Leviathan, published in 1651; in 1687 the mathematician Isaac Newton in his Principia Mathematica announced the law of gravity and ushered in a new age of mechanical physics. The scientific and philosophical revolution precipitated by the late 17th century in Europe opened the way to developing a modern understanding of nature and natural laws and above all accepting that such things were intrinsically knowable, not part of a Divine Plan whose purpose was not to be questioned. The new principle, according to the late 18th-century Prussian philosopher, Immanuel Kant, was sapere aude—‘dare to know’.

Those who pioneered a critical, scientific view of the world ran great risks. In 1616 the Catholic Church banned Copernican teaching, and placed Galileo under house arrest for challenging scripture. Galileo was fortunate: a few years before, in 1600, Giordano Bruno, another Copernican, was burnt at the stake in Rome. Hobbes was forced into exile, suspected of atheism; John Locke, who wrote the founding text of modern liberal representative government in the 1680s was also forced to write in exile, and his works circulated in parts of Europe in secret, too subversive for open sale. Writers of the 18th-century ‘Enlightenment’, during which critical thinking began to flourish for the first time, had to steer a careful line between what could or could not be said. Rousseau was also banned for life from his native city of Geneva for his radical democratic views. But it was a tide that could not be held back. By the early 19th century most of the modern Western sciences had been established on a firm scientific basis; political and social theory exploded traditional claims to authority (expressed most clearly in the founding of the American Republic in 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789); organized religion in its Western guise was shown to be unable to defend its major contentions about the nature of the universe and of man’s place in it and an alternative, naturalistic, rational model of the world was substituted. The triumph of free expression now seems irreversible, but the revolution represented by modern thought was not inevitable and its progress was subject to fits and starts. It is still not entirely clear why the prevailing authorities in Europe came to tolerate the new intellectual wave when a century before it might have been violently suppressed. The publication in 1859 of On Liberty by the English philosopher John Stuart Mill summed up what had been achieved in modern Europe. There was no other freedom, Mill asserted, more fundamental than the right to say what you like without fear that you will be silenced.

The formal acquisition of scientific, material knowledge about all aspects of the natural world and its application to human societies has been responsible for transforming world history more fundamentally than any other development in the past 6,000 years. Whatever case can be made for showing that there are strong lines of continuity throughout world history, the possibilities opened up by transcending the narrow world view of a God-centred and God-given universe have been unprecedented. It is a story intimately bound to the wider history of the rise of Europe (which with European expansion to America came to be regarded as the Western world) over the past 500 years. Historians have often been tempted to see this is as a happily progressive narrative while the rest of the world stagnated. From a Western perspective the idea of ‘the triumph of the West’ has an evident plausibility. Yet it begs the larger question of why Europe did evolve in very different ways, not only from the other civilizations existing alongside, but from all previous civilizations. What has been distinctive about the West, as Karl Marx argued in the mid-19th century, is the fact that it proved capable of expanding world-wide; Marx thought that no other culture or civilization would be capable of withstanding what Europe had to offer or what it forced upon them.

There is no agreed or straightforward answer to the question ‘why Europe?’ Geography was clearly favourable—a temperate climate, generally adequate food supplies, population growth steady but not excessively large, few of the debilitating, parasite-borne diseases that affected large parts of Africa and Asia with elephantiasis, river-blindness, bilharzia or malaria. The long European shoreline, never very far from any human habitation, encouraged the development of seaborne trade and exploration and the development of early sea power. Seafaring technology was one of the earliest and most important of the technical revolutions and Europeans exploited it fully. Europe also succeeded in stemming the tide of regular invasion which had characterized European history for almost a thousand years from the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. The Tatar invasions of the 13th century and the expansion of the Ottoman Turkish Empire into south-eastern Europe during the early modern period were checked sufficiently to allow central and western Europe to consolidate the state system, to build a settled network of cities, and a regular trading network. The military organization of Europe was transformed by the application of gunpowder and the development of cannon and musket - fire. Although these innovations were usually used against other Europeans, they gave Europeans a clear advantage whenever they found themselves fighting non-European peoples. It is sometimes argued that post-Reformation Protestantism, with its emphasis on individualism, played an important part in making Europe different, but the earliest explorers and imperialists were Catholic Portuguese and Spanish, while the Americas were discovered by an Italian from Genoa, Cristoforo Colombo. The long history of the Crusades against the Arab Middle East showed that there was nothing passive about Catholic Christianity.

The distinctive characteristic of European societies as they solidified into an early version of the modern states’ system was their willingness to look outwards towards the wider world. The voyages of discovery were not isolated examples of a lucky piece of exploration, but rapidly embraced the whole globe, making it clear in the process that the earth was round rather than flat. Only Europeans embraced the world in this way: map-making, navigation, inland exploration, elaborate descriptions of native communities and exotic fauna and flora, all contributed to creating a view of the world fundamentally different from the view from Constantinople or Beijing. Not only did Europeans discover large areas of the hitherto unknown (at least to Europeans) but they began a process of aggressive settlement across the Americas, in parts of Africa and India and into the archipelagos of the western Pacific ‘spice islands’. If occasionally briefly reversed, European expansion proved irresistible and European appetites insatiable. The Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés captured the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán in 1520 with 300 Spanish troops and some local allies aided by the fact that around half the city’s 300,000 inhabitants had died of imported smallpox. Once the imperial toeholds were established across the oceans, Europeans never abandoned them. They became a source of remarkable wealth, helping eventually to make Europe richer than any rival civilization, and making it possible to defend and extend the imperial frontier.

Wealth itself would not have made Europe distinctive. The rulers of China and India were fabulously rich. What made the difference was how that wealth was used. The application of rational organization and scientific technique made possible a remarkable economic revolution. An important fraction of the wealth generated in Europe was mobile wealth, mobilized to develop yet further wealth by banks and commercial houses, which developed across Europe from the late 17th century. This was the engine that made commercial capitalism possible and it was fuelled by an acquisitive urge that was subject to few customary or religious restrictions. From the late 18th century the mobile wealth was used to fund a second revolution of technique. Although inventiveness was nothing strictly European—Chinese scientists and engineers had anticipated many European discoveries, including gunpowder—the critical difference was the application of invention. The development of steam technology in Britain made possible the mobilization of new and efficient forms of energy quite distinct from the water or horse-powered technologies of other cultures. The development of gas and later generated electricity as an energy source, the mastery of turbine technology, the perfection of rail locomotion, were all uniquely Western, a blend of European and American innovation. In a mere hundred years the gap between Western technique and the rest of the world was unbridgeable, making possible the rapid expansion of European states as imperial powers. The British American colonies won their independence in 1783, and European settlers, enjoying the same technical advantages and territorial ambitions, occupied the whole area of North America between Mexico and Canada by the middle years of the 19th century.

The economic and technical revolutions relied on a high level of social and spatial mobility. Europeans moved abroad in large numbers, bringing with them Christianity, guns, and trade. In western Europe there were few barriers to social mobility, allowing new classes of successful bankers, merchants and manufacturers to play an influential part in public affairs. The establishment of secure property rights and respect for individual wealth-making removed any legal inhibitions on the right to make money. The publication of Adam Smith’s classic The Wealth of Nations in 1776 provided a sound intellectual basis for the claim that the interests of communities were best served by allowing the free play of market forces and individual pursuit of economic well-being. Economic individualism and belief in the benign concept of the market had no equivalent in other cultures. Internal mobility was also important. The new industries attracted large numbers of rural workers who were no longer tied to the soil, at least in western Europe. Rapid population growth from the late 18th century, which threatened to put a severe strain on food supplies, was absorbed into the new cities; at the same time rising agricultural yields and the application of modern techniques (fertiliser cycles, threshing machines, stock breeding) made it just possible for the mobile urban population to be fed. The new wealth could then be used to fund overseas food production and imported foodstuffs. In 1877 the first refrigerated food was carried on board ship between Argentina and France making it possible to bring meat and fruit half-way across the world.

The economic revolution was accompanied by other important changes. In Europe and the United States the idea of education for all replaced the traditional distinction between illiterate mass and the educated few. Education was basic for most people, but opportunities for higher forms of training or for university expanded throughout the 19th century and became general in the twentieth. Civil rights and the rule of law were applied in most European states and the settler communities overseas, and limited progress was made towards representative forms of government. One of the most striking aspects of the move to greater emancipation was the gradual recognition in the liberal West that women should have equal rights—social, sexual, political—with men, even if the principle has not always worked as it should. Finally, the idea of the modern nation-state, in which identity was derived from being a citizen of a particular nation, defined by territory, shared culture and language, although far from universal even in Europe in the 19th century (and certainly not applied to Europe’s empires), set the model that has been subsequently established worldwide. The United Nations now counts 195 sovereign states, all but three as members.

The impact of Western wealth, military advantage, technology and ambition on the rest of the world was catastrophic. India was conquered, the Mughal emperors overthrown, and British rule imposed. China succeeded in keeping the West at bay, but at the cost of regular punitive expeditions, and the final sapping of China’s traditional political system by Western-educated Chinese who wanted China to adopt modern politics and economics. The Ottoman Empire crumbled under the remorseless pressure of Europe, which took over the whole of North Africa and encroached on the Ottoman Middle East. The Empire finally collapsed in 1919 at the end of the First World War. Everywhere else traditional societies, long isolated from any contact with a wider world, were visited, annexed, fought over and incorporated into the Western orbit. What resulted was usually an unstable mix of tradition and novelty, the old order sufficiently challenged or undermined that it could no longer function effectively, the new order mediated by surviving social traditions, religious practices and native cultures. The one exception was Japan. Contact with the West in the 1850s was perceived to be an immediate threat. In 1868 the Tokugawa Shogunate was overthrown, the Meiji emperor restored, and a rapid process of modernization undertaken to shield Japan from Western imperialism. Within forty years Japan’s modern armed forces could defeat the much larger Russian army and navy in the war of 1904–5; in the 1930s Japan invaded large parts of China and in 1941 Japanese forces launched a swift and successful campaign against American and European territories in the Pacific and South-East Asia which was reversed only by the exploitation of Western technologies yet more advanced.

The changes ushered in by the rise of European and American power have developed exponentially. The history of the past 250 years shows a dizzying transformation: global horizons have narrowed with mass communication and the development of a homogenized consumer culture; a level of knowledge and technical achievement unimaginable a century ago makes it possible to explore planets millions of miles distant, to revisit the earliest moments of the universe, to understand the genetic codes that dictate human biology, to harness lasers and micro-electronic components to produce a technical base not only of exceptional sophistication, but one that is also democratic in its reach. Some sense of the sheer speed of change can be illustrated in numerous ways, but few examples are more remarkable than the difference between the colonial wars of the late 19th century, fought with Gatling machine guns, rifles and small artillery pieces and the Second World War fought only forty years later with tanks, high-speed aircraft, radar, radio, missiles, and, in its late stages, with jet aircraft and nuclear weapons.

The Western experience, for all its technical and social achievements, has nonetheless been profoundly ambiguous. There have been perhaps no other civilizations which have been so publicly anxious about the prospects for their survival, so fearful of pride before a fall. The two world wars, both generated in Europe, compromised that claim to be the heartland of modern civilization and a source of social progress and moral authority, which had been relayed throughout the last decades of the 19th century. Exporting ideas about civil rights and nationhood accelerated the decline and disappearance of the old European empires. The transfer of the British crown colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997 marked a symbolic end to a long history of coercive European expansion and acknowledged China’s growing international stature. The export of Western technology and commercial skills resulted in the collapse of many European industries and the transfer of large-scale manufacturing to the rapidly growing economies of eastern and south-eastern Asia. The global reach of Western commerce and the remorseless march of English as the global language has produced a backlash against what are perceived to be new forms of imperialism, and against the crass failure of Western states to understand the complex differences that still mark off communities in Asia, Africa, Latin America or the Middle East from the Western model. Islamic terrorism is only one of the many fruits of hostility to the idea that somehow the Western model ought to be appropriate in any cultural or geographical context.

Where, then, is this history going? Accelerated change can be read several ways: it could either mean speeding downhill to the edge of the precipice, or climbing rapidly to a richer, more secure and more peaceable world. Historians would do well do be humble in the face of the future. The unpredictable and unpredicted can be found throughout the chapters that follow. How few commentators and Sovietologists thought in the late 1980s that the Soviet bloc would possibly collapse in a matter of a few years; how many observers thought, wrongly, that HIV/AIDS would provoke an unstoppable pandemic which would decimate the world’s population. One thing can be said with certainty: for all the talk of a new unipolar world built around the massive military power of the United States and the appeal of the Western model, the foreseeable future will have China, Russia, India and the Middle East, the great bulk of the world’s population, developing in ways that are not consistent with an ideal Western model, capable of exerting a growing influence on global economic structures and the distribution of political influence, able perhaps to restore at least some of that diversity in historical experience characteristic of all recorded history up to the 19th century.

Taking the longer view there is little to be said. A hundred human lives of 60 years will take us to 8,000 AD. Perhaps the acceleration of history will provoke a sudden crash long before that. There remain the awful paradoxes that the more ‘progress’ there has been, the more violence, discrimination and crime has been generated and the more economic desires are satisfied, the nearer the earth moves to ecological crisis. As Nietzsche remarked more than a century ago, ‘the universe does not need man’. Human history may well be finite. On the other hand, the history of the world hitherto has shown man to be a remarkably adaptable, ambitious, unscrupulous, technically adept creature. This history so far is no simple parable of survival and triumph; the future of the world may have to be just that.

HUMAN ORIGINS AND EARLY CULTURES
Recorded history is only the tip of an iceberg reaching back to the first appearance on earth of the human species. Anthropologists, prehistorians and archaeologists have extended our vista of the past by hundreds of thousands of years: we cannot understand human history without taking account of their findings. The transformation of humankind (or, more accurately, of certain groups of humans in certain areas) from hunters and fishers to agriculturists, and from a migratory to a sedentary life, constitutes the most decisive revolution in the whole of human history. The climatic and ecological changes which made it possible have left their mark on the historical record down to the present day.
Agriculture made possible not merely a phenomenal growth of human population, which is thought to have increased some 16-fold between 8000 and 4000 BC, but also gave rise to the familiar landscape of village communities which still characterized Europe as late as the middle of the 19th century and which even today prevails in many parts of the world. Nowhere are the continuities of history more visible. The enduring structures of human society, which transcend and outlive political change, carry us back to the end of the Ice Age, to the changes which began when the shrinking ice-cap left a new world to be explored and tamed.

FROM c. 5 MILLION YEARS AGO
HUMAN ORIGINS
Global cooling between five and six million years ago saw savannahs replace the tropical forests of sub-Saharan Africa. The appearance of this new environment was in turn matched by an evolutionary pulse that gave rise to new carnivores and omnivores. Among them were the hominines, the ancestors of modern man.
The earliest hominine fossils, discovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, are the fragmentary 4.5-million-year-old remains of Ardipithecus ramidus. Better evidence is available of the later and more widespread Australopithecenes, or “southern apes”. Skeletal and fossilized footprints of Australopithecus afarensis, dated to between three and four million years ago, indicate a serviceable if not fully bipedal gait, hands still partly adapted for specialized tree climbing and a brain approximately one-third the size of ours. This species is the probable ancestor both of the robustly built Australopithecines boisei, aethiopicus and robustus, all with large teeth and herbivorous diets, and of our genus, Homo, meaning “man”. A major discovery thrown up by fieldwork since the 1950s has revealed that these closely related but nonetheless distinctive species not only lived at the same time but side by side in the same habitats. Finds of more species are expected.
From between two and three million years ago, there is evidence of important evolutionary trends in Homo: brains became much bigger, a process known as encephalization; and full bipedalism was attained—as the 1974 discovery of the fossil skeleton known as ‘Lucy’ shows. As larger brains need better diets to sustain them, the increase in brain size could only have occurred as a result of significant evolutionary pressures. The problem was compounded because hominines stayed the same size, with the result that their bigger brains could be achieved only by reducing the size of another organ, the stomach, a trade-off which in turn reduced the efficiency of the digestive tract, which in turn demanded a still better diet.

EARLY TECHNOLOGIES
The most convincing explanation of this development—the expensive tissue hypothesis—holds that a move towards an energy - rich diet, particularly animal proteins, was responsible. And indeed the earliest - known stone tools, found in Gona, Ethiopia, suggest that 2.5 million years ago meat was a central part of hominines’ diet, with the sharpened stones used to cut flesh and pound marrow rich bones from carcasses either scavenged or brought down and then defended against carnivores. Burnt bones found in southern Africa indicate that by 1.5 million years ago hominines had learned to “cook” their food, a development which again would have compensated for smaller stomachs by breaking down animal proteins before digestion took place.

OUT OF AFRICA
This pattern of development was the basis for the first colonization, by Homo erectus, 1.8 million years ago of areas outside sub - Saharan Africa. Then, around 500,000 years ago, Homo heidelbergensis migrated into north Africa and the Near East, reaching northern Europe about 400,000 years ago (however there is also good evidence in northern Europe for hominines 700,000 years ago). Homo erectus and heidelbergensis are sometimes considered to have shared a common ancestor, a type designated as Homo ergaster, and best known from the skeleton found at Nariokotome in Kenya’s Rift valley. By perhaps 1.5 million years ago, all three had brains of about 1000cc (61cu in) and an adaptable stone technology: the weight and careful shaping of the edges of their distinctive handaxes, whether pointed or oval, made them effective butchery tools.
Stone technology was not the only factor in the evolutionary pressures that led to larger brains. It was also to do with allowing hominines to remember, to manipulate, to support and to organize others in more complex ways. Perhaps paradoxically, as hominines developed these more sophisticated social structures, so they simultaneously became less reliant on one another and better adapted to living in smaller groups. This in turn allowed them to colonize harsher barrier habitats such as the Sahara at the margins of their homelands from where they could colonize new, more temperate areas beyond.

MODERN HUMANS
From about 500,000 years ago, this early burst of colonization came to a halt. Instead, though there were undoubtedly many dispersals of populations and much intermingling of genes, regional groups of separate populations living side by side such as the Neanderthals developed. But from 100,000 years ago, another major dispersal began when anatomically modern people—Homo sapiens sapiens—emigrated from sub-Saharan Africa. By 50,000 years ago, Australia had been reached, by boat; 33,000 years ago, the western Pacific islands were colonized; 15,000 years ago, the Americas were reached. Major expansion into the Arctic began about 4500 years ago as the continental ice sheets retreated. Finally, 2000 years ago, humans began to settle the deep Pacific islands from where they reached New Zealand around 1200 years ago, 1000 years before the island’s discovery by Captain Cook.

FROM c. 200,000 YEARS AGO
THE SPREAD OF MODERN HUMANS
DNA studies have revealed that the first anatomically modern humans—Homo sapiens—arose in Africa between 200,000 and 140,000 years ago. Though much has still to be discovered about their origins and dispersal, by almost 28,000 years ago Homo sapiens had become not only the sole human species but the first truly global one.
The earliest modern-looking human skulls yet found are about 130,000 years old and come from the Omo basin in Ethiopia and Klasies River Mouth in southern Africa, the latter one of the best - researched sites of early human habitation. Perhaps 100,000 years ago, these early populations began to disperse, migrating northwards out of Africa. These migrations were followed by a process known as “bottlenecking” in which population levels among the dispersed peoples remained small for thousands of years. It is possible that a contributory factor to bottlenecking was the eruption of Toba in northwest Sumatra 71,000 years ago, an environmental catastrophe on an extraordinary scale: parts of India were covered with ash up to 3m (10ft) deep, global temperatures were lowered for a millennium. At the same time, the restricted populations generated by bottlenecking had the side effect of encouraging rapid changes in genetic structures thereby increasing the pace of evolutionary change.
Archaeological and genetic evidence then point to a further rapid expansion of modern human populations about 50,000 years ago. The archaeological evidence in particular highlights growing sophistication and the mastery of a wide and increasing range of skills. In some regions, lighter, multi-component weapons have been found, including spears made from skilfully produced stone blades fixed to wooden shafts and handles. There is evidence, too, of textiles and baskets, and of more orderly layouts of camp-sites, including cold-weather dwellings and underground food stores. Trading networks also increased dramatically. Raw materials, particularly stone, which had previously been traded over distances of less than 80km (50 miles), were now traded over several hundreds of kilometres (there is good evidence for this in eastern Europe).

THE NEANDERTHALS
Homo sapiens was by no means the only human species in the world of 50,000 years ago. In East and southeast Asia lived the descendants of those Homo erectus populations who had colonized the region over a million years earlier. Among other human populations the best known are the Neanderthals, distinguished from modern humans by their distinctive large and low - crowned heads with prominent brows and big teeth and powerful stocky bodies well adapted to cold. By contrast, the incoming modern people had an African body pattern—slender with long legs and small torsos — that copes better with heat stress. The Neanderthals had brains as large as modern humans and were in many ways highly successful. They adapted well to a wide range of habitats and climates ranging from the relatively arid Middle East to the cold of central Europe; their use of tools was sophisticated; and they were effective hunters of animals in prime condition such as bison, horse and reindeer. The burial of their dead, often with some elaboration, also indicates signs of a recognizably modern humanity. They almost certainly had language, too. But what the Neanderthals seem not to have possessed is the degree of social flexibility and cultural tradition that more than any other characteristic singles out Homo sapiens and explains our ultimate success in becoming the only global hominine.

This social and intellectual sophistication reveals itself in a number of ways but the result of it was almost always the same: the evolution of more complex social relations which allowed early humans to thrive in a much wider range of habitats and societies than previous hominine species had managed before. Whether living in large or small groups, Homo sapiens was able to overcome its environment to an unprecedented degree. The most striking evidence is provided by the wide variety of artefacts that have been discovered: engraved stones, ornaments, figurines, exotic shells, amber and ivory and, most famously, cave paintings. That the latter were frequently inaccessible and could have been seen only with ladders and artificial light suggests that a variety of factors motivated their creators. Whatever the explanation, these early works of art are an evocative monument to the humanity of these early hunters.
It is significant that the Neanderthals had almost no cultural traditions of this kind. A few incised bones have been found; similarly, the very occasional exotic piece of raw material occurs. By almost 28,000 years ago, both Neanderthals and Homo erectus were extinct. Modern humans had already colonized Australia 20,000 years before, and were set to colonize the Americas before 12,000 years ago. Henceforth modern humans were the sole surviving hominine in the world.

20,000 TO 10,000 BC
THE ICE AGE WORLD
By 10,000 years ago, humans had colonized almost the whole of the habitable world. It was an achievement made in the face of the last of a series of Ice Ages, when vast sheets of ice periodically advanced and retreated. The human species today is the product of this long process of adaptation to the varied conditions of the Ice Ages.
There have been eight Ice Ages in the last 800,000 years, each interspersed with warmer periods from 30,000 to 10,000 years known as interglacials, brief and extreme parts of this cycle. The Ice Ages were periods of exceptional cold away from the equator. Ice sheets advanced across the frozen wastes of the northern hemisphere as temperatures fell by up to 15 degrees centigrade. With so much of the earth’s water locked into the ice sheets, sea levels fell by up to 150m (500ft). As they did so, land bridges appeared, linking many major land areas and present-day islands into larger continental land masses.
Equatorial regions were also affected: as rainfall diminished, half the land area between the tropics became desert. With each advance of the ice, the plants and animals of the northern hemisphere withdrew to warmer latitudes. As the ice retreated, so they moved northwards again. Humans, too, must have migrated with these changing climates. Yet despite the extremes of cold, the human species continued to develop, spreading from its original African homeland to east and southeast Asia and to Europe. Mastery of fire and the invention of clothing were crucial to this achievement, as were new social and communication skills.

ICE AGE HUMANS
The height of the last Ice Age or LGM (last glacial maximum) was reached about 20,000 years ago. As the ice expanded, human populations contracted into a small number of more favourable habitats. Across almost the whole of the Eurasian landmass between the ice to the north and the deserts to the south, from the glacial cul-de-sac of Alaska to southern France, productive grasslands and steppes were created. Rich in seasonal grasses, they sustained large herds of mammoth, bison, horse and reindeer, all of them important food sources for Palaeolithic (the period of the emergence of modern man, about 2.5–3 million years ago to 12,000 BC) hunters.
Much the same sort of habitat seems to have developed in North America. By the time modern humans migrated there about 15,000 years ago, the rolling grasslands were teeming with animal life: giant bison with a six-foot horn spread; towering beaver - like creatures called casteroides; camels; ground sloths; stag moose; two types of musk - oxen; several varieties of large, often lion - sized cats; mastodons; and three types of mammoth. So effectively did the new human population hunt them that by about 10,000 years ago almost all of them were extinct, including the horse, re - introduced to the New World only by Europeans following in the wake of Columbus.
South of the Eurasian mammoth steppe lay an extensive zone of drier conditions. Indeed parts of the Sahara, the Near East and India became almost entirely arid, forcing their populations along permanent watercourses such as the Nile. Similar patterns of settlement are found in Australia, where cemeteries discovered along the Murray River bear marked resemblances to those along the Nile.
Modern humans were late arrivals in western Europe, replacing Neanderthal populations only from about 35,000 years ago. Yet the new communities developed remarkable levels of cultural expression. In southwest France, the Pyrenees and northern Spain, hundreds of caves decorated with paintings of symbols and animals have been discovered, evidence of a rich cultural tradition.
By 12,000 years ago, the last Ice Age was drawing to a close. As temperatures rose, vegetation spread and animals re-colonized the cold northern wastes. With them went hunters and gatherers. By 10,000 BC in Central America and the Near East, people had begun to move beyond their existing resources and to investigate new ways of producing food and manipulating plants and animals in the first experiments in farming.

8000 TO 4000 BC
FROM HUNTING TO FARMING: THE ORIGINS OF AGRICULTURE
The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture irreversibly changed human society, but it involved the domestication (selective cropping and planting, or herding and rearing) of relatively few plants and animals and occurred independently in a very few areas. The earliest evidence of agriculture comes from the Levant 10,000 years ago, from where it spread to Europe, northern Africa and central Asia.
Ten thousand years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age, the human population numbered only a few millions and all their food came from wild plants and animals. Then people began to domesticate some species, so that today almost the entire world population depends for food on a relatively small range of crops and domestic animals. During the 150,000 years that preceded the “agricultural revolution”, anatomically modern humans had colonized most of the the globe and had learned to survive as foragers, subsisting on a great diversity of plant and animal foods. Foragers moved seasonally in small groups to obtain their food supplies and population densities remained low for many millennia.

FORAGING TO FARMING
By 8000 BC, some groups of foragers had settled down and occupied favourable sites year-round. Their populations increased, as restraints on fertility imposed by the seasonally mobile way of life were relaxed, and they ranged less far for their food. This profound change in human behaviour led to the beginnings of agriculture, enabling more people to be supported on a given area of land—although at the cost of the greater effort needed to cultivate crops and raise domestic animals. The effects of settling down, population increase, and growing dependence on agriculture led to increases in the number and size of settlements, to the development of more complex, less egalitarian societies, and, eventually, to urban life and civilization.
The earliest evidence of agriculture consists of the remains of wild species that have been altered in their morphology or behaviour by human intervention. Foremost among the crops are the cereals and pulses (peas, beans and other herbaceous legumes), the seeds of which provide carbohydrate and some protein and are easily stored. They sustained early civilizations and are still staples today. They were domesticated from wild grasses in subtropical regions, for example wheat, barley, lentil, pea and chickpea in southwestern Asia; rice, soya and mung bean in southern and eastern Asia; sorghum, other millets and cowpea in tropical Africa; and maize and the common bean in Mexico. Root crops have also become staples in many areas, such as the potato, which was domesticated in the Andes and is now a major crop of temperate areas, and manioc (cassava), yams, taro and sweet potato, all of which were native to the tropics.

DOMESTICATION OF ANIMALS
Whereas cereals and root crops were brought into cultivation and domesticated in all the habitable continents except Australia (where agriculture was introduced by European settlers in the 18th century AD), animals were domesticated in relatively few areas, principally in western Asia, where there is evidence for the early domestication of sheep, goats, pigs and cattle, followed later by asses, horses and camels. Some forms of cattle and pigs, as well as chickens, were domesticated in southern and eastern Asia, and cattle and pigs may also have been domesticated independently in Europe. Very few animals were domesticated in the Americas—turkey in North America and llama, alpaca and guinea pig in South America—and none in tropical Africa or Australia.

THE SPREAD OF FARMING
The earliest known transition to agriculture took place in the “Fertile Crescent” of southwestern Asia during the Neolithic period starting about 8000 BC. Sites in the Levant have yielded charred seeds and chaff of barley, wheat and various pulses, as well as the bones of domestic goats and sheep. Grain cultivation began here about 1000 years before goat and sheep pastoralism. Dependence on agriculture increased very gradually, paralleled by the spread of village settlement, the development of techniques of irrigation and terracing, and the cultivation of fruits. By the end of the Neolithic in southwestern Asia, about 6000 years ago, agriculture had spread west and east into Europe, northern Africa and central and southern Asia.
Agriculture began independently in China between 7000 and 6000 BC, in the Americas by about 3000 BC and in tropical Africa by about 2000 BC. By the time of the 16th century AD European expansion in the agricultural and pastoral economies occupied most of Eurasia, Africa and Central and South America.

10,000 TO 4000 BC
BEFORE THE FIRST CITIES: SOUTHWEST ASIA
The period 10,000 to 4000 BC witnessed three critical developments: the origins of settled life; the first farming; and the first cities. The origin of agriculture is often referred to as the “Neolithic revolution”, but archaeology reveals only gradual changes in techniques of food acquisition over thousands of years, which by 8000 BC led to villages dependent on food production.
The earliest changes visible in the archaeological record relate not to food production but to social relations, indicated not only in the tendency to reside in one location over longer periods and in the investment of labour in more substantial and more permanent structures, but also in the growth of ritual, an important factor in social cohesion. Indeed it is possible that this “symbolic revolution” was of greater immediate significance than the economic changes we associate with the origins of agriculture.
Lakeshore and riverine sites were important for their rich and varied resources, while the utilitarian date palm flourished in marsh areas in southern Mesopotamia, rich also in fish and waterfowl. The earliest permanent settlements tend to be found at the junctions of discrete environmental zones, with greater access to a variety of resources (for example Abu Hureyra on the boundary of the dry steppe and the Euphrates flood plain, and Ain Mallaha in the Jordan valley). The importance of ritual house fittings and skull cults, perhaps suggestive of the increasing importance of the family and property, is attested at some of the earliest sites (Qermez Dere), while 9th-millennium villages in Anatolia, with early evidence for the cultivation of cereals, contain impressive ritual buildings (Çayönü, Nevali Çori). The carving of stone (Göbekli Tepe, Jerf al Ahmar, Nemrik) and the working of copper (Çayönü) are found well before the appearance of true farming villages. The early use of clay for containers is attested at Mureybet on the Euphrates (9000 BC) and at Ganj Dareh in the Zagros; white lime plaster vessels are characteristic of the latest pre-pottery Neolithic phases, especially at sites in the Levant and Anatolia.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF VILLAGES
Among the best-known pre-pottery Neolithic sites is Jericho, in the 9th millennium BC already a settlement of some 1.5ha (4 acres) with, uniquely, a rock-cut ditch and stone wall with a huge circular tower ascended by means of an internal circular stair. A millennium later Basta and Ain Ghazal in Jordan are farming settlements of over 9.5ha (24 acres). Human skulls on which faces had been realistically modelled were kept by the inhabitants of these sites, while at Ain Ghazal deposits of cultic statues have been recovered.
In the 7th and 6th millennia BC, developed Neolithic villages appear over much of the landscape. They are characterized by economies dependent on domesticated plants and animals, and on sophisticated technological developments (for example an “industrial” area of two-stage pottery kilns, and the presence of lead and copper at Yarim Tepe around 6000 BC). Well-fired painted pottery characterizes these villages, which are often classified by their ceramic styles. One of the most spectacular early pottery sites is Çatalhöyük, 13ha (32 acres) in area, with extensive evidence for wealth in the form of valuable commodities such as obsidian and semi-precious stones. The house fittings bear elaborate ornaments including wall paintings and the plastered skulls of wild cattle.

TRADE AND TEMPLES
An important development attested in the Neolithic villages of north Mesopotamia and Syria is the earliest record-keeping, effected by the use of combinations of small clay tokens and the stamping of distinctive clay or stone seals onto clay lids and other fastenings (most importantly at Sabi Abyad in the Samarran period and slightly later at Arpachiyah). Such simple methods of validating social contracts and other transactions formed the basis of later literate urban recording systems.
Mesopotamia had no metals or semi-precious stones, and by the 5th millennium BC demand for such luxury goods led to the establishment of small colonies in Anatolia, even as far as the Malatya plain (Değirmentepe) and the sea-borne exploitation of the resources of the Persian Gulf (Dosariyah, Abu Khamis), even as far as the Musandam peninsula. The first temples were built at this time in southern Mesopotamia, precursors of the institutions around which the earliest urban states were organized. There was a temple on the same site at Eridu for 3500 years, striking evidence of the continuity of tradition which was one remarkable feature of the world’s earliest city-states.
Despite their precocious development, sites like Jericho and Çatalhöyük did not form the focus of more complex polities. By 4000 BC the foundations of literate, urban civilization had been laid in Mesopotamia, where it was the organizational and economic potential of the highly productive irrigation economy in the south and the powerful, strategic positions of sites like Nineveh in the north, controlling access to areas rich in raw materials, that saw the growth of the world’s first complex states.

7000 TO 2000 BC
EARLY EUROPE: THE COLONIZATION OF A CONTINENT
Farming first spread from the Near East to southeast Europe c. 7000 BC and then along the Mediterranean coast and across central Europe, reaching the Low Countries by 5000 BC. After a brief pause it spread to Britain and northern continental Europe by 4000 BC. It was only c. 2000 BC that farming reached the more northerly parts of European Russia and the Baltic.
The earliest farming villages in Europe, dating to immediately after 7000 BC, were on the western side of the Aegean (eg Argissa) and on Crete (eg Knossos), but by 5500 BC such villages were distributed widely across the Balkans. They consisted of clusters of mudbrick buildings, each with a similar layout of hearth and cooking and sleeping areas. Their economy was based on keeping sheep and cultivating wheat and legumes. Such villages were situated in areas of good soil with a plentiful water supply and were often occupied for hundreds of years.

AGRICULTURAL VILLAGES
Villages of this kind spread inland as far as Hungary but from here northwards a new pattern developed. The mudbrick dwellings were replaced by wooden long-houses whose remains did not build up into settlement mounds. Agricultural settlement spread in a broad band from northeast France to southwest Russia on soils produced by the weathering of loess—a highly fertile windblown dust laid down during the Ice Age. Over this area the characteristic pottery was decorated with incised lines in spiral or meandering bands, a uniformity which reflects the rapid spread of settlement between 5500 and 5000 BC. Cattle were more important than sheep in the forested interior of Europe but wheat continued as the main cereal crop. The settlers did not clear wide areas of land but practised intensive horticulture in the valleys around their settlements.
At the same time as it was spreading into continental Europe, aspects of an agricultural way of life were also spreading westwards along the northern shore of the Mediterranean, reaching Spain by around 5500 BC; in this zone environmental conditions were much closer to those where agriculture started and fewer adjustments had to be made.
Alongside the early agricultural communities, small groups of foragers pursued their way of life in areas untouched by the new economy. Hunting populations were rather sparse in the areas first selected by agriculturists, and the rapidity with which farming spread across the loess lands may in part reflect a lack of local competition, but elsewhere foragers were more numerous. They were especially well-established in the lake-strewn landscapes left by the retreating ice sheets around the Alps and on the northern edge of the North European Plain.
There has been much debate about whether the spread of agriculture was due to the expansion of colonizing populations from the southeast or to the adoption of the new way of life by existing foragers. Current evidence from archaeology and the analysis of the DNA of modern populations suggests that there was a colonizing element, probably associated with the expansion through the Balkans and the loess lands of central Europe, but that in most of Europe the dominant process was the adoption of agriculture and its material attributes by existing populations, perhaps in part because of the prestige of the new way of life.

MEGALITHIC EUROPE
In much of western Europe, farming was first adopted around 4000 BC and the clearance of land in rocky terrain provided the opportunity to build large stone (megalithic) monuments as burial places and mortuary shrines for the scattered hamlets of early farmers. Some of the earliest megalithic tombs were built in Brittany and Portugal around 4500 BC, but particularly elaborate forms were made in Ireland and Spain up to 2000 years later. Alongside the tombs, other kinds of megalithic monuments were constructed in some regions, such as the stone circles of the British Isles.
From 4500 to 2500 BC, important developments occurred which were to change the established pattern of life. Early metallurgy of copper and gold developed in the Balkans from 4500 BC, although whether this was an independent invention or came from the Near East is still in dispute. Fine examples of the products come from the rich Copper Age cemetery of Varna on the Black Sea coast.
From around 3500 BC there is evidence of contact between eastern Europe and the steppe zone north of the Black Sea; some link this to the spread of Indo-European languages to Europe. The time around 3500 BC also saw the rapid spread across Europe of wheeled vehicles and the plough, both associated with the first large-scale use of draught animals. These slowly changed the nature of agricultural production. Widespread clearance of forests took place and flint mines produced stone for large quantities of axes. It was only after 2000 BC that stone axes were superseded by metal ones in western Europe.

AFRICAN PEOPLES AND CULTURES
Archaeology is revealing evidence that strongly suggests that the evolution of humans began in Africa. Virtually every stage of our development—stretching back over 5 million years—can be traced in the African record. Almost throughout this vast span of prehistory our ancestors lived in mobile groups engaged in scavenging, gathering and hunting.
From about the 10th millennium BC onwards, conditions in large parts of Africa were wetter than they are today, and human settlements began to spring up by lakes and rivers, from the Rift valley and Sudanese Nile valley in the east, across what are now the central and southern Saharan regions, to the Senegal River in the west. These earliest African settlements were based on fishing and were characterized by certain shared aspects of material culture, most notably barbed, bone harpoon heads. Such similarities between the disparate settlements have led to the view that these communities were part of one cultural complex. However, there is considerable local variation in associated stone-tool industries, and it may therefore be more accurate to consider the appearance of these sedentary hunting-gathering-fishing communities as the result of a broadly contemporary, but independent, adaptation of different groups of people to the changing environment.
It was this ability to adapt to changing circumstances that led to the gradual transition to food production, that is, the cultivation of domesticated plants and herding of domesticated animals. It must be stressed that our current understanding of African food production is far from comprehensive. However, the view that food-producing techniques spread from the Fertile Crescent via the Nile valley to the rest of Africa is no longer tenable as far as plant cultivation (with the exception of wheat and barley) is concerned, and it may not be so for cattle domestication. From the 7th millennium BC onwards there is evidence of cattle-herding in present-day Algeria and the Egyptian Western Desert at Nabta Playa, which may be indicative of local domestication. At about the same time barley, wheat and domestic small stock, such as sheep and goats, were introduced from the Near East into the Nile delta. In central and southern Sahara early food production involved a move from fishing to livestock herding. The domestication of plants in these regions seems to be associated with progressive dessication after about the 5th millennium BC. As water and grazing land disappeared in the emerging desert, cattle-herding communities dispersed. These climatic and demographic factors initiated, or perhaps accelerated, the independent development of tropical agriculture.

However, it was only in the Nile valley that the advantages of food production led to state formation before about the 1st millennium BC. This is seen most spectacularly in the rise of dynastic Egypt at the end of the 4th millennium; but as early as about 2400 BC there is evidence of a substantial town at Kerma, near the third cataract, which includes fortifications, facilities for copper-smelting and eight large mound graves. Because of the many Egyptian artefacts recovered from the site, Kerma was once thought to have been an Egyptian colony. But there is plentiful evidence to support the view that it was a Nubian site and that the indigenous people had a prolonged, primarily commercial, contact with Egypt. Kerma reached a political and cultural peak during Egypt’s Second Intermediate Period (c. 1720–1550 BC) but failed to survive the militaristic imperialism of the New Kingdom. The kingdom of Napata, which succeeded Kerma, did not emerge until about 900 BC.


TO 300 BC
PEOPLES OF THE AMERICAS
First colonized by Siberians during the Ice Age, the Americas then developed in complete isolation from the rest of the world. Nonetheless, ways of life and forms of social organization evolved in much the same ways as in the Old World, though languages and customs were distinct as was much of the technology that was developed.
When were the Americas first peopled and by whom? Long controversy is now deepening with the results of new research on genetics. But the general view remains that humans first entered the Americas from Siberia around 15,000 years ago. A second Asiatic immigration in about 8000 BC brought the first speakers of the Na-Dene languages of northern and western North America, and then came the ancestors of the Aleuts and Inuit. From this point on, the Americas remained almost entirely isolated from further human contact until the European discovery of the continent 500 years ago.
Linguistic diversity today shows that these early colonists soon spread. Archaeology confirms that the southernmost tip of South America was inhabited by 9000 BC and northernmost Greenland by 1750 BC (by “Independence” cultures). The way of life—travelling in small bands, gathering, fishing and hunting—encouraged such wide dispersal. Yet in some areas large groups assembled regularly. Buffalo hunts on the Great Plains of North America called for extensive cooperation. Gatherings on this scale would have been annual highlights for the people involved. They continued in remoter areas into the early 1900s, allowing anthropologists to discover something of the organization, knowledge and skills of this largely unchanged way of life.

THE FIRST SETTLEMENTS
With the end of the Ice Age, peoples in the temperate and tropical zones of the region came to rely increasingly on both non-migratory prey and migratory wildfowl, on shellfish beds and on seasonal farming, all of which encouraged settled ways of life and population growth. Along the west coast of North America and the southeast coast of South America, fishing was to remain a mainstay but elsewhere—in Mesoamerica, the Central Andes and Amazonia—gathering and hunting gradually declined in favour of farming. Both cause and effect, villages were flourishing in many areas by 1500 BC.
The most widely grown crop was maize, though manioc (cassava) became important in lowland South America and potatoes and cotton in the Andes. Other early crops included gourds, squashes, beans, tomatoes, avocados, chillies and aloes. Turkeys and dogs were kept for food in Mesoamerica, guinea pigs in the Andes. Herding was restricted to the Andes, where llamas were important as pack animals, and both llamas and alpacas were raised for wool.
Settled village life did not preclude long-distance trade. Sea shells and metal tools and ornaments were circulated widely in eastern North America. Pottery provides evidence that sailors ranged along much of the west coast of South America as well as north to Central America. It is not known whether it is diffusion of this kind or a common and older Siberian heritage that explains the cultural similarities widespread among native Americans even today.

EARLY CIVILIZATIONS
Settled life permitted rising populations. Similarly, the need for farm labour may have encouraged the trend. But how were larger groups to live together? Across the continent, political leaders emerged. They used religious institutions to reflect and mould new forms of organization. Across the eastern half of North America, families gathered around ceremonial earthworks for festivals. Their tombs suggest that funerals were political occasions, too. There is evidence from these burial places of distinctions between rich and poor, governors and governed.
In the Central Andes, temples stood guard over warehouses built to store seasonal surpluses and precious imports. Community assets were the objects not only of local rivalry but of outsiders’ jealousy as well. Gruesome sculptures at Cerro Sechín may depict warfare. Later, around 700–400 BC, the Chavín cult transcended local rivalries. Associated with ideas about supernatural spirits, its rites, architecture, sculpture, goldwork and fine textiles were used in many districts, probably partly to justify the privileges of chieftains. These ideas were to last long (see p. 36).
In Mesoamerica during the same period religion was almost certainly used to the same ends by the Olmecs, whose cult was also widespread and also part of a tradition that lived on. Chiefs seem to have claimed pivotal roles in the organization of the cosmos. Earthworks, rock art, sculpture and decorated pottery served the cult and illustrated it. Again probably for the same reasons, the Maya adorned their pyramids with similar religious and political symbols.
All the while, chiefs were supposed not to order their people but to depend on them. The break came in Mexico, in about 500 BC, with the foundation of Monte Albán as a new capital for the Zapotecs. Whether or not this move was prompted by a need for local cooperation in managing water resources or by common interests in defence, it was soon evident—from the site’s architecture, its symbolism, and the rulers’ effects on the surrounding villages and their conquests further afield—that a more powerful and centralized form of rule had arisen: the state. From the same period at Monte Albán is the earliest evidence for hieroglyphic writing: dated records of conquest.


TO 500 BC
SOUTHEAST ASIA BEFORE CIVILIZATION
With its long coastlines, mountain ranges and great river valleys fed by heavy seasonal rains, both the mainland and islands of southeast Asia provided a wealth of resources for early humankind. The diversity of flora and the abundance of metal ores allowed the growth of agricultural communities from at least the 4th millennium BC.
There seems little doubt that Homo erectus, the ancestor of all modern humans, was established in southeast Asia west of the biogeographical boundary “Wallace Line” more than one million years ago. But only Java, with its favourable geological conditions, has provided the skeletal evidence; elsewhere only discoveries of stone tools along river terraces and in some limestone fissure deposits reveal his passing.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE
Abundant archaeological evidence for modern human hunter - gatherers comes only in the Late Pleistocene, and mainly from sites in the limestone mountains: among the best known are Tham Khuong and Nguom in northern Vietnam, Lang Rongrien in Thailand, Leang Burung in Celebes, and Tabon Cave in the island of Palawan in the Philippines. From about 40,000 years ago a varied range of flake stone tools have been found in these caves, left by people who exploited a wide range of plants, small and large animals and molluscs. This way of life persisted until about the 6th millennium BC, with changes in the toolkit from flake tools to pebble choppers—the Hoabinhian tradition, called after the region in north Vietnam where it was first described.
From at least 6000 BC village settlements with evidence for rice-growing and pottery-making have been found in southern China, but perhaps because there has been relatively little research on early village sites in southeast Asia no settlements of rice farmers older than 3000 BC have been found in northern Vietnam and inland areas of Thailand, although Phung Nguyen in the Red River valley of Vietnam and Ban Chiang and Non Nok Tha in northern Thailand have all been well investigated. But the best evidence for late Neolithic occupation of southeast Asia comes from Khok Phanom Di, a 7m (23ft)-deep village mound occupying about 5ha (12 acres) near the coast southeast of modern-day Bangkok. Here over 150 burials and rich occupation layers dated to between 2000 and 1400 BC provide evidence of intensive exploitation of the sea and adjacent mangrove forests, and the beginnings of social differentiation.

METAL TECHNOLOGIES
From early in the 2nd millennium BC bronze tools were added to the existing stone, bone and antler toolkits in central and northeast Thailand and northern Vietnam, where we can refer to a true Bronze Age from about 1500 to 500 BC. The best known Bronze Age locations in Thailand are Ban Chiang and Ban Na Di in the northeast and Nil Kham Haeng near Lopburi in the Chao Phraya valley. In Vietnam more sites of this phase are known including Dong Dau, Viet Khe, Cau Chan, Trang Khen, Lang Vac and Dong Son on the Ma river where a rich burial ground has been excavated since the 1920s and given its name to the late Bronze Age culture of the region, best known for its great bronze drums. These are widely distributed from Yunnan in southwest China to Thailand, Malaya and many parts of Indonesia where they seem to have been traded in antiquity as objects of great prestige and magical power.

INFLUENCE FROM INDIA
In western and peninsular Thailand, Malaysia, Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia and the Philippines bronze metallurgy seems to have arrived only with iron after about 500 BC and to have been introduced from India as maritime trade routes were extended across the Bay of Bengal. In graves of this period are found glass and semi-precious stone jewellery of great aesthetic and technical sophistication together with iron tools and weapons, while in inland areas large moated-mound settlements and well laid-out cemeteries mark the emergence of powerful chiefdoms whose rulers, attracted by the rituals and prestige of Indian culture, soon adapted these to enhance their own status and power. Sites such as Ban Don Ta Phet, Khao Jamook, Khuan Lukpad, Ban Prasat, Non U-Loke, Ban Lum Khao and Ban Chieng Hian in Thailand, and Giong Ca Vo, Giong Phet, Doc Chua, Long Giao, Hang Gon and Hau Xa in southern and central Vietnam have all produced rich examples from this last stage of prehistoric culture on the mainland of southeast Asia, as have Plawangan and Lamongan in Java and Gilimanuk and Sembiran in Bali, where glass beads imported from south India and a potsherd with a Brahmi inscription serve to mark the end of prehistory.

TO 1770
AUSTRALIA
About 40,000 years ago, when lower sea levels linked Tasmania, Australia and New Guinea, man first ventured onto Sahul, the greater Australian continent. That journey from a southeast Asian homeland was a pioneering one, as it involved at least one major sea crossing. The original Australians were therefore among the world’s earliest mariners.

PLEISTOCENE AUSTRALIA
The strange new world that greeted these newcomers was of enormous size, and ranged from tropical north to temperate south. Some of the edible plants found in more northerly latitudes were related to those of Asia and were therefore familiar; but this was not so of the animals. In addition to the mammals that have survived until today, there was a bewildering assortment of giant forms: 3m (10ft) tall kangaroos, various enormous ox - like beasts, a large native lion and rangy, ostrich - like birds. This megafauna was a rich and easily available food source but it was reduced and eventually killed off by the advancing human tide.
Consequently, it was on the plentiful supply of fish and shellfish along the coasts and in the rivers that the newcomers focused their attention, and it was in these areas of Australia that the first human settlements were concentrated. Most of the sites are lost to us, for between 40,000 and 5000 years ago the sea level was lower than it is at present, and the sites now lie offshore, on the continental shelf.
The Pleistocene inhabitants of Australia used red ochre to create elaborate rock paintings, thus laying the foundations of a rich and long - lived Aboriginal custom. Their stone core implements and crude scrapers belong to what is known as the Australian Core Tool Tradition. This tradition, which underwent remarkably little change in more than 40,000 years, is pan-Australian, but there are a number of regional elements that have links with New Guinea and southeast Asia. One of these is the edge-ground axe, which has been dated to 22,000 years in Arnhem Land. Similar ground-stone tools found in Japan are up to 30,000 years old. Ground-stone tools were ultimately developed in most other parts of the world also, but only in a much later period.


ABORIGINAL SOCIETY
About 5000 years ago, following the end of the last ice age, the sea rose to its present level; and while Aboriginal settlements were still concentrated along the coasts there was a rapid increase in the exploitation of inland resources. At about this time a range of small, finely finished flake implements especially developed for hafting sharp tools, and known as the Australian Small Tool Tradition, appeared across the continent. The dingo was also introduced.
Political, economic and religious development continued and by the time the first European settlement arrived in the 18th century, there were about 750,000 Aborigines living in around 500 tribal territories. Although the Aborigines’ way of life was still based on hunting and gathering (they never became full-scale agriculturists) they had developed very intricate and finely balanced relationships with their environment. In desert areas, small nomadic groups ranged over thousands of square kilometres, while in richer parts of the continent there were settled, permanent villages. Fish traps were constructed, grasses and tubers were replanted to assist nature, and fire was used systematically to burn old vegetation and encourage the growth of rich new plant cover and the abundant new game it attracted. Rare goods, such as ceremonial axes, shells and ochres, were traded from one side of the vast continent to the other, as were stories down the accompanying “song lines”.

TO THE 1700S
MELANESIA AND POLYNESIA
Melanesia and Polynesia were first settled, from around 50,000 years ago, by modern people from southeast Asia. These adventurous people were the world’s first great blue-water sailors and seaborne colonists. They moved in waves, initially into New Guinea and its adjacent islands, and over time they gave birth to the Melanesian and then the Polynesian traditions. There were many great migrations, and the furthermost Pacific islands were reached as late as AD 750.
The Pacific islanders’ ancient ancestors, the early people or Homo erectus, lived in southeast Asia two million years ago. During this period, the Pleistocene, sea levels meant that the land mass of southeast Asia included much of the western part of what is now the archipelago. Remains of these people have been found in Java, part of the ancient continent known as the Sunda shelf, which is, for the most part, submerged today.

FIRST MIGRANTS
Around 50,000 years ago, Homo sapiens, or modern people, arrived in the region. These people were hunters and gatherers who drifted the short distance to the ancient continent of Sahul (modern-day Melanesia, which at the time was attached to Australia) around 40,000 years ago. Skulls of Homo sapiens found in the area date back to this time. These people had settled the New Guinea highlands by 25,000 years ago. Eight thousand years ago rising seas following the end of the last ice age caused the separation of New Guinea from the continent of Australia.
A second wave of southeast Asian immigrants known as the Austronesians, or Lapita people, arrived in New Guinea 6000 years ago. Lapita is their distinct, red - slipped pottery, often intricately decorated with geometric patterns, which can be traced right across the western Pacific. These new migrants were aided by their revolutionary new technologies, such as the sail and the outrigger canoe, and the development of root crops (taro) and pig and chicken farming. These advances made it possible for the Austronesians to discover and settle the islands across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. Recent archaeology, genetic mapping and linguistic analysis show that this was not a rapid “express-train” migration, as initially thought, but rather a “slow-boat” penetration. Most of the rest of island Melanesia was settled as recently as 4000 years ago, and Fiji (the blurred boundary between Melanesia and Polynesia) was reached as late as 3500 years ago.
In the Tonga (reached 3200 BP (before present)) and Samoan (3000 BP) regions, the Melanesian material culture gradually evolved over a thousand years of relative isolation into what we now call Polynesian. Polynesian mariners using sophisticated navigation techniques and large ocean-going canoes reached and settled the Marquesas as late as AD 300, and from there the remaining Polynesian islands were discovered and settled. Early evidence shows settlement of Easter Island by AD 400, there to give birth to an extraordinary culture. The Society, Cook and Hawaiian Islands were settled by AD 600 and New Zealand by AD 750. Coconuts from southeast Asia reached Panama by AD 1500, and the sweet potato, though native to eastern Polynesia, travelled in the other direction, reaching highland New Guinea in the 16th century.

ISLAND RESOURCES
Between AD 750 and 1300, a multitude of largely independent cultures evolved on these little “island universes”. In the New Guinea highlands, where farming flourished, population density was the greatest in the world and easily sustainable. On most Pacific islands a balance was reached between population and natural resources; in less hospitable places, such as Easter Island and New Zealand, initially abundant resources became very depleted and, by the time of European contact in the 17th and 18th centuries, populations were in conflict and decline. When the Maoris arrived in Aotearoa (New Zealand) from about AD 750, they found large numbers of a flightless bird, the Moa. Some of these were gigantic, up to 3m (10ft) high and weighing up to 250kg (550lb). Unafraid of man, the Moa proved a readily available food source, and over the next 400 years they were hunted to extinction. The first Maoris thus established themselves with a Moa-fed burst in population numbers, while succeeding generations had to battle hard to sustain themselves.

TWO
 
THE FIRST CIVILIZATIONS
About 6000 years ago, in a few areas of particularly intensive agriculture, the dispersed villages of Neolithic peoples gave way to more complex societies. These were the first civilizations, and their emergence marks the start of a new phase of world history. They arose, apparently independently, in four widely dispersed areas (the early civilizations of America emerged considerably later): the lower Tigris and Euphrates valleys; the valley of the Nile; the Indus valley around Harrappa and Mohenjo-Daro; and the Yellow River around An-yang. The characteristic feature of them all was the city, which now became an increasingly dominant social form, gradually encroaching on the surrounding countryside, until today urban civilization has become the criterion of social progress. But the city possessed other important connotations: a complex division of labour; literacy and a literate class (usually the priesthood); monumental public buildings; political and religious hierarchies; a kingship descended from the gods; and ultimately empire, or the claim to universal rule. A dichotomy already existed between the civilized world and the barbarian world outside. The onslaught of nomadic peoples eager to enjoy the fruits of civilization became a recurrent theme of world history until the advent of effective firearms in the 15th century AD tilted the balance in favour of the civilized peoples.


3500 TO 1500 BC
THE BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION IN THE EURASIAN WORLD
Urban civilizations developed independently in four different areas of Eurasia, as the exploitation of fertile river valleys allowed complex forms of social organization. The sudden growth of cities was a dramatic development in human history, and was accompanied by the beginnings of literacy. From this period it becomes possible to write true history.
The development of urban societies seems to have been triggered by a sudden concentration of population in certain river valleys, which in some cases may have been a result of climate change which made the surrounding areas outside the valleys less attractive for habitation. The need to exploit the fertile land of these valleys and their alluvial plains to feed a growing population then led to the development of irrigation and flood -   control mechanisms. In Mesopotamia and China this involved the construction of canals to carry water away to the land around the Tigris - Euphrates and the Yellow River, while in Egypt and India the annual flooding of the Nile and Indus provided fertile silt in which crops were grown.

THE FIRST CITIES

Mesopotamia c. 3500 BC          leading cities
Egypt       c. 3100 BC          single unified kingdom
Indus       c. 2500 BC
China       c. 1800 BC          the Shang dynasty

The concentrated populations were able to produce surplus crops which could be exported to areas beyond the rivers in return for raw materials and precious items not locally available, above all bronze. The food surplus also made possible social groups not directly involved in agriculture, whether specialized craftsmen or rulers and military leaders. It was when ambitious individuals and families succeeded in diverting resources into the construction of monumental ceremonial centres that provided a focus for the populations living near them that the first true cities appeared. This took place in Mesopotamia in c. 3500 BC and in Egypt in c. 3100 BC, while the Indus valley cities appeared in c. 2500 BC, and in China urbanism began in c. 1800 BC.
The political development of these different regions was not uniform: in Egypt a single unified kingdom emerged almost immediately, extending from the Nile delta south to the first cataract; in China the earliest civilization is associated with the Shang dynasty, although the Shang rulers may have just been leaders of a loose confederacy. In Mesopotamia, by contrast, no one city was able to establish control for any period, and competition for dominance between the leading cities characterized the history of the area for nearly three millennia. The situation in the Indus valley is less clear, but the major cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro appear to have coexisted until the decline of the Indus cities after about 2000 BC. It appears that in all these civilizations, religious, political and military power was concentrated in the hands of a few ruling families.
Trade and exchange were important in the expansion of the first civilizations. The possession of prestige goods and the desire to acquire more resources were instrumental in the emergence of the first empires in Mesopotamia. During the 3rd millennium BC goods were being traded between the Indus and the Mediterranean. In the 2nd millennium BC urbanization spread to Anatolia and the Aegean, and the cultural influence of the Near East can be seen in the bronze - working of the Balkan communities. However, in many parts of Eurasia, including the fertile river deltas of the Ganges and Mekong, the landscape did not favour concentrations of population, and village communities remained the norm until the 1st millennium BC.

The development of writing occurred almost at the start of each of the four civilizations. The earliest known use of writing in China was for divination: the Shang rulers used prepared turtle shells and ox scapulae heated in a fire to establish the will of the gods, and the result of the enquiry was scratched onto the shell or bone. In Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus valley writing was used mainly for administrative activities, with inventories and accounts being inscribed on clay. Early examples of writing have often survived because clay tablets were accidentally baked, fixing the messages permanently. Clay inscriptions spread to Crete and Greece by around 1500 BC. In Egypt and Mesopotamia the use of writing developed rapidly, as large public inscriptions, including law - codes, were erected by the rulers as monuments to their wisdom, justice and power. It is from monuments such as these, celebrating their victories or their public works, that the earliest true history can be reconstructed.

c. 3500 TO 1600 BC
THE EARLY EMPIRES OF MESOPOTAMIA
The broad plain through which the Tigris and Euphrates rivers flow gave birth to the world’s first cities. Irrigation systems made it possible to support substantial populations and complex administrative structures. With urbanization came more developed economies and trade, while competition between cities led to warfare and the first empires.
The earliest cities appeared in Mesopotamia in the second half of the 4th millennium BC: at Uruk, Ur, Tell ‘ Uqair and Susa vast and elaborately decorated ceremonial complexes were built as the centres of urban settlements, probably under the leadership of families eager to display their power and their respect for the gods. The fertile plains and valleys watered by the Tigris and the Euphrates produced food surpluses sufficient to support these elaborate new centres and their complex social structures.
The cities were the basic political units of Mesopotamia. Religion was fundamental to their social organization: the rulers of cities presented themselves as favoured servants of the gods, while lower down the social scale agricultural workers had a necessary role in producing the materials for sacrifices and offerings to the gods. The cities established diplomatic and trade relationships with each other, although little is known of the mechanisms for this. Finds of goods from Uruk, the predominant city in Mespotamia from around 3500 BC, have come from as far afield as Susa and Syria. The effect of trade and gift - exchange between cities encouraged the development of a common culture from the edges of the Persian Gulf to Mari in the northwest and Ashur in the north. Although other languages were spoken, the early use of Sumerian as a written language has led to the use of the term “Sumerian” to describe the culture and society of early and middle 3rd millennium.

THE EMPIRE OF AGADE
Towards the end of the 3rd millennium powerful leaders attempted to expand their influence over a wider area. The first was Sargon (c. 2296–2240 BC), who created a new political centre at Agade, also known as Akkad, before conquering the cities of southern Mesopotamia and claiming authority over areas as far west as Byblos. The empire of Agade was enlarged by Sargon’s grandson Naram-Sin (2213–2176 BC), but within a generation of his death it had disappeared, as its subject cities reasserted their independence. The rise of Agade had long - lasting effects on the region, with Akkadian (whose variants included Babylonian and Assyrian) replacing Sumerian as the main language of Mesopotamia.
A century later the rulers of the Third Dynasty of Ur (Ur III: 2047–1940 BC), beginning with Ur-Nammu, built an empire in southern Mesopotamia, but in common with the other early Mesopotamian empires it was not long-lasting and its decline left a number of important cities competing for power. The centre of activity moved to northern Mesopotamia, and a new elite emerged—the Amorites—who had previously been excluded from power. The most successful Amorite leader was Shamshi-Adad I, who established a short-lived empire in Assyria in the years after 1750 BC. After his death the region returned to a period of competing rulers, as reflected by the assessment of an advisor to Zimri-Lim of Mari (c. 1714–1700 BC): “There is no king who is strong by himself: 10 or 15 kings follow Hammurabi of Babylon, as many follow Rim-Sin of Larsa, Ibalpiel of Eshnunna and Amutpiel of Qatna, while 20 kings follow Yarim-Lim of Yamkhad.” Soon after this Hammurabi was able to establish an empire of his own, and Babylon became a leading power in the region for the first time.

THE LAW CODE OF HAMMURABI
Hammurabi is most famous for his law code, inscribed on a large stone with a carving of the king in the presence of Shamash, the Babylonian sun god. Although it is presented as a practical collection of laws including the principle of punishment with “an eye for an eye”, the primary function of the document was probably to advertise the achievements of Hammurabi’s reign. After his death, his successors in the First Dynasty of Babylon ruled for about 90 years before the city was raided by the Hittites, and a new phase in the history of Mesopotamia began (see p. 34).

c. 3100–1000 BC
ANCIENT EGYPT
The history of the ancient Egyptian state is one of successive periods of unification and fragmentation. Counterbalancing this is a pattern of civilization—characterized by such features as the use of writing, an organized system of religion and divine kingship, and dependence on the annual Nile floods for the fertility of the land—which links the different periods together through a span of 3000 years.
Tradition dates the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt to 3100 BC, but it is more accurate to see the emergence of a unified state around this time as the outcome of formative processes stretching back into prehistory. The 4th-Dynasty pyramids at Giza, the largest of which was built by Khufu (Cheops), are the most famous examples of Egypt’s monumental funerary architecture, which expressed the divine status and power of the pharaohs of the Old Kingdom. Construction projects on this scale were possible only because of the enormous wealth of the state, derived mainly from agriculture. The pharaohs controlled this resource through a system of assessment, taxation, collection and redistribution. Central rule broke down at the end of the 6th Dynasty. Although the reasons for this are not entirely clear, it is probable that a series of low Nile floods and consequent famines were one factor in the loss of political and social stability that marks the onset of the First Intermediate Period (from c. 2181 BC).

MIDDLE KINGDOM REUNIFICATION
Egypt was reunified under Mentuhotep of Thebes, and a new era, known as the Middle Kingdom, began. Thebes became an important centre, and its god, Amun, was identified with the sun god, Re, who had been closely connected with royalty since Old Kingdom times. During the 12th Dynasty, which represented the high point of the Middle Kingdom, trading expeditions were sent to Palestine, Syria, and south to Nubia, where the Egyptian presence was consolidated by the construction of several forts clustered around the second cataract. During the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1720–1550 BC) power devolved to various local rulers until foreigners from the east, known as the Hyksos, extended their authority over a large part of Egypt. The Hyksos were eventually expelled by the independent rulers of Thebes, who reunified Egypt from the south.

EXPANSION AND DISUNITY
During the New Kingdom, military conquests created an Egyptian empire stretching from the Euphrates in the north to Nubia in the south. Within Egypt, imperial expansion was matched by magnificent construction works of tombs and temples. The cult of the most important god Amun-Re was temporarily set back when Akhenaten (c. 1364–1347 BC) built a new capital at Amarna, where the worship of the Aten or solar disc was promoted.
Under Rameses II Egypt reached a pinnacle of wealth and power, but there are clear indications that from the reign of Rameses III onwards there were growing external and internal problems. Egypt’s empire in Syria and Palestine was lost. Its eastern and seaward borders were threatened by the sea peoples. On the western border, despite the victories of Rameses III, the Libyans posed a continuing and destabilizing problem. Internally, royal power was eroded by such factors as weak rulers, administrative inefficiency and the growing authority of the high priests of Amun at Thebes. By the end of the 20th Dynasty (c. 1069 BC) Egypt was once again a disunited land.

1600–1000 BC
THE NEAR EAST
The period after 1600 BC saw the fertile lands of Mesopotamia and the Levant become the battleground between rival empires: Hittites, Mitannians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Elamites and Egyptians. After 1200 BC, however, these powers collapsed in a dramatic sequence of events that is still not fully understood by historians. The resulting two centuries of upheaval marked the end of the Bronze Age in the Near East.
Much of the detailed knowledge of the relationships between the warring empires comes from the “Amarna letters”. This collection of documents written in Akkadian (the international language of diplomacy in this period), consists of correspondence between the Egyptian pharaohs Amenophis III, Akhenaten and Tutankhamun (1390–1327 BC) and the rulers of the other great powers. The letters reveal the dynastic marriages and gift - giving that typify relations between rulers: the personal and the political were intimately bound together.
The most important new power in the region was the Hittite empire in central Anatolia. The Hittites had been expanding their power from their centre at Hattushash since the reign of Hattusili I (c. 1650–1620 BC). Mursili I (c. 1620-c. 1590 BC) led an expedition that destroyed Aleppo and Babylon, but it was Tudhaliya I (c. 1420–1400 BC) and Suppiluliuma I (1344–1322 BC) who made the Hittites an imperial power. The empire consisted of a large number of small territories governed by client kings who owed their position entirely to the “Great King” who ruled from the capital, Hattusa. Client rulers were required to raise troops for the king’s campaigns, and to provide labour and goods for the central administration. They were often bound to the king by marriage ties.

The Hittites faced frequent pressure on their borders from Arzawa to the west and the Gasga to the north, but their biggest rivals were Egypt and the kingdom of Mitanni to the south. Mitanni first appears in the historical record in c. 1480 BC, when its ruler, Parrattarna, is described as controlling Aleppo. For the next 140 years Mitanni was a major power, controlling Assyria by 1400 BC. Mutual concern about Hittite power saw an alliance between Mitanni and Egypt, and the last independent ruler of Mitanni, Tushratta, married his daughter to Amenophis III and, after the pharaoh’s death, to his son Amenophis IV (Akhenaten). Tushratta was assassinated in c. 1340 BC, and his son Shattiwaza was installed as a vassal of the Hittites. Hostility continued between the Hittites and the Egyptians, leading to the great but inconclusive battle of Kadesh in 1275 BC between the pharaoh Rameses II (1279–1213 BC) and the Hittite king Muwatalli (1295–1271 BC).

Assyrian expansion began under Ashur-uballit I (1353–1318 BC), as Mitanni began to collapse under Hittite pressure. Adad-nirari I (1295–1264 BC) seized what was left of Mitanni from the Hittites, and Assyrian power grew to its greatest extent in the reign of Tikulti-ninurta I (1233–1197 BC), who conquered Babylon and installed a series of puppet rulers. Up until then Mesopotamia had been through a period of stability, ruled from Babylon, which came under the control of the Kassites in c. 1595 BC. Little is known about their origins, but they were noted for their horses and chariots, and maintained power for four centuries.

The Assyrian attack on Babylon led to counter - attacks from Elam to the southeast. The Elamite kings Kiden-Hutran (c. 1235–1210 BC) and Shutruk-Nahunte (1185–1155 BC) led campaigns into Mesopotamia, the latter capturing Babylon. Despite a Babylonian revival under Nebuchadnezzar I (1126–1205 BC), the general upheaval that brought an end to the Bronze Age saw both Babylon and Elam more or less disappear from the historical record within a few years.

Around 1200 BC there was a wave of destruction throughout the eastern Mediterranean from Greece to Syria and Palestine. Fifty years later several cities in Mesopotamia were also destroyed. There are reports from the city of Ugarit of attacks from the sea, and the Egyptian pharaohs Merneptah (1213–1203 BC) and Rameses III (1184–1150 BC) describe battles with “sea peoples”. Although this obscure group was once considered the cause of widespread destruction it is now thought that they were merely taking advantage of a widespread breakdown in political organization. Earthquakes, drought, interruption to the supply of metals, and many other things, have been suggested as the cause of the collapse. It is likely that no one explanation will suffice, and that a number of external factors, combined with the fragility of the centralized power structures of the Bronze Age kingdoms, led to the dramatic end of the civilizations of the Bronze Age.

300 BC TO AD 1300
PEOPLES OF SOUTH AMERICA AND
 THE CARIBBEAN
By 300 BC most people in South America had become farmers, although some hunter - gathering persisted in the southern part of the continent where farming was difficult. By 750 BC, complex societies were developing in the Andes. As in Mesoamerica, they went through phases of growth and decline, but in the central Andes there was a degree of cultural unity in that artistic differences between the highlands and lowlands were not as marked.

SOUTH AMERICA
The coast of the central Andes is best known, archaeologically, for the graphic pottery of the Moche, dating from AD 100 to 600. It reveals much about daily life and religion. The Moche were the first to assert themselves more widely by conquest. Both pottery and tombs show that, like their contemporaries in Mesoamerica, Moche kings exhibited their authority in elaborate rites.
Yet from about AD 600 the coast succumbed to conquest from the Tiahuanaco and the Huari. Both these civilizations developed elements of the earlier Chavín cult (see p. 19). The city of Tiahuanaco was centred on the Titicaca Basin in Bolivia where the people grew potatoes and herded llamas and alpacas. Renowned for their stone buildings and sculpture, their expansion seems to have been achieved through the establishment of religious and commercial colonies. The reasons for its collapse about AD 1200 are not fully understood, but may have been related to climate change that affected agricultural production. The Huari are often considered to have been the precursors of the Inca. Among the hallmarks of Huari civilization was a network of roads and logistical, perhaps administrative, bases. Following two centuries of political fragmentation, the Moche tradition was revived among the Chimú, consummate engineers who developed vast irrigation systems. They controlled parts of the Andean coast until their destruction by the Incas (see p. 143).
In the northern Andes and southern Central America, along the Amazon and in the plains southwest of the Amazon, there were other large populations. Much of the most telling evidence for them is in the form of extensive field systems. In northwestern South America chiefdoms had emerged, and in the southernmost parts of Central America superb sculpture, goldwork and pottery indicate powerful patrons.

THE CARIBBEAN
There is some evidence that peoples exploiting wild food resources occupied Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic about 4000 BC. However, it was between 500 and 250 BC that farmers began migrating to the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico from the Orinoco and other rivers in northeast South America. They introduced the cultivation of manioc (cassava) and brought with them dogs and a distinctive red and white pottery known as Saladoid. Between AD 500 and AD 1000, the population in these islands expanded and spread to parts of the islands of Hispaniola (today Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Cuba and Jamaica. Most of these people were probably Arawak speakers. With population growth the societies became more complex and chiefdoms emerged. These people were later known as Tainos.

300 BC TO AD 1300
PEOPLES OF MESOAMERICA
Many societies in the Americas changed little in the 2000 years before 1300. In Mesoamerica, however, complex societies were developing by the end of the first millennium BC. They then underwent cycles of growth and decline that included periods of outstanding intellectual and artistic achievement.
By 300 BC, almost every way of life that the Europeans would later encounter had developed in Mesoamerica: while some societies in northern Mexico continued to live by hunting, fishing and gathering, most had adopted farming and some were developing into states that extended their influence by trade or force.

THE RISE OF TEOTIHUACÁN
Earlier developments in Mesoamerica were eclipsed in about AD 100 by the sudden rise of Teotihuacán. The city grew to about 200,000, much larger than cities in the Old World at the time. There are doubts about the nature of the city’s economy but the centre—with the Temple of Quetzalcoatl and the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon—was clearly planned for rites that involved human sacrifices. The city also possessed thousands of artisans who produced many items for foreign trade, including many articles made of obsidian, which they obtained from mines they controlled at Pachuca. Whether or not in association with trade, the Teotihuacános’ influence spread widely through present-day Mexico and Guatemala and was apparent in their distinctive pottery, crafts and architecture. In the 7th century AD Teotihuacán was attacked either by insiders or outsiders, or both, and its power destroyed, although it continued to function as a town.

THE RISE OF THE MAYA
At the same time the small but brilliant kingdoms of the Maya flourished. Their capitals were pyramid - studded ceremonial centres with densely settled suburbs. Voluminous inscriptions reveal a sophisticated but typically Mesoamerican concern with astrology. For a long time it was not understood how these cities in a tropical forest were supplied with food. It now seems they built terraces, drained fields and made extensive use of game and fish. However, whether it was on account of the chronic wars that are recorded, or of popular discontent, or of environmental degradation by excessive population—or of all of these factors—most of the towns were abandoned between AD 790 and the mid-9th century. Many districts revived later in what is known as the Post-Classic period, but the Maya never regained their grandeur.

THE RISE OF THE TOLTECS
The Maya “collapse” followed the dissolution of Teotihuacán in about 700. But between these poles of power a new generation of thriving towns had emerged, including some of Teotihuacán’s protégés, such as Cholula, which established their independence from the traditional order. They appear to have been eclipsed in turn by the Toltecs, soldiers and probably traders, whose influence subsequently extended throughout Mesoamerica and beyond. In about 1175 their reign, too, ended, possibly on account of refugees from the north driven south by changing climatic conditions. Meanwhile, two Nahua-speaking migrations from central Mexico had extended Mesoamerican influence to societies on the Pacific coastal plain as far south as Costa Rica.

300 BC TO AD 1300
PEOPLES OF EARLY NORTH
 AMERICA
The early cultures of North America were predominantly agrarian - based, with small communities developing in and around areas where the natural environment provided rich sources of food. By AD 700 three distinct cultures had developed. These were more urban and culturally diverse, and they were heavily influenced by Mexican civilizations. By the beginning of the 15th century, however, these cultures were in decline.
By 300 BC, the area stretching from Ohio to West Virginia had already been settled. Small communities and villages developed in river valleys, where natural food resources (such as mammals, birds, fish and vegetable foods) were both abundant and close at hand. Horticulture also developed around this time: sunflowers, marsh elder and squashes were cultivated.
Archaeological evidence from this period points to the existence of chiefdoms: the elaborate burial sites, such as that at Hopewell in Ohio, are excellent indicators of the social, religious and trade networks through which imported goods, as well as ideas, filtered. By AD 700, three distinct cultural traditions had emerged in southwestern North America: the Hohokam, Mogollon and Anasazi. Their area of influence covered much of the territory that is now Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, and also extended south into Sonora and Chihuahua.

The Hohokam, Mogollon and Anasazi cultures all had contact with Mexico, and this contact became a significant influence on their development. Excavations have revealed ball courts and Mesoamerican-style mosaics, bracelets, effigy vessels and figurines. The architectural layout of the towns (which were used as economic, religious and trading centres) also reveals Mexican influence, and the Mexicans may even have established Casas Grandes in Chihuahua as the “capital” of the Mogollon culture.
The first true towns in North America appeared in the Middle Mississippi Valley from AD 700. They were characteristically built on large, flat - topped, rectangular mounds, which supported temples and mortuary houses for the elite society and more modest timber houses for the town’s merchants and officials. A town generally consisted of up to 20 mounds grouped together around a plaza and enclosed by a defensive wooden stockade. The towns had substantial populations: it is estimated that some reached 10,000 inhabitants.
The large rural population (about 200 people per square km) was based predominantly in the fertile river valleys surrounding the towns. Again, Mexican influence here is evident: after AD 700, a hardier strain of maize, popular in Mexico, was introduced and cultivated. In addition, the introduction of the bow and arrow to replace the spear - thrower and dart meant more efficient hunting of the abundant game on the uplands.
By the time 16th-century French explorers discovered the area, the population had advanced to a ranked, matrilineal society headed by a chief who ruled four well-defined classes. Archaeological evidence from Mississippi to Minnesota and from Oklahoma to the Atlantic coast also bears witness to the widespread existence of a religion known as the Southern Cult. Reaching its peak in 1250, the cult was strongly influenced by Mexican practice, especially in regard to the importance of the four cardinal points and the significance placed upon death.
Disease, caused by unhealthy overcrowding and poor sanitation, heralded the slow decline of the early North American cultures after AD 1300. However, their demise was a but a pale foreshadowing of the destruction that was to befall these cultures when Europeans arrived in the New World.

TO 475 BC
THE BEGINNINGS OF CHINESE CIVILIZATION
Geographically and climatically China has a range of favourable conditions for human settlement, which took place 500,000 years ago. A turning point was reached at about 1600 BC when China entered the Bronze Age. It was then that Chinese culture took shape, as written languages, philosophies and stable socio-political and economic structures gradually emerged.
China has been inhabited continuously by humans since very early times. Remains of early hominines, which are similar to those from Java, have been found across large areas of southeast China. In about 500,000 BC Peking Man—Homo erectus—was living around Pohai and in the southeast and possibly in central and southern China as well. Homo sapiens first appeared in Palaeolithic cultures in the Ordos region, in the north and in the southwest in about 30,000 BC. Later Mesolithic cultures flourished in the north, south and southwest and in Taiwan.

EARLY AGRICULTURALISTS
Neolithic agricultural communities, the immediate ancestors of Chinese civilization, arose around 7500 BC in what is now southern China and in the loess - covered lands of the north and northeast, where the well-drained soil of the river terraces was ideal for primitive agriculture. One of the best early sites is Pan-p’o, with round and rectangular houses, pottery kilns and a cemetery area. In the valley of the Yellow River, early agriculture depended heavily on millet, but in the Yangtze delta area evidence of rice - paddies dates from the 5th millennium BC. By 3000 BC, more sophisticated skills developed, including the carving of jade, and small townships rather than villages began to emerge.
Around 1600 BC China entered the Bronze Age with its first archaeologically proven dynasty, the Shang (c. 1520–1030 BC). Chasing copper mines, the Shang moved their capital at least six times, and three, at Cheng-chou, Erh-li-t’ou and An-yang, have been excavated. Many smaller Shang sites have been found and some are now known from the Yangtze valley in central China indicating the Shang expansion southward. In addition, the Shang had trade relations with most of the northern and central east Asian mainland.

THE CHOU DYNASTY
In the 11th century BC the Shang territory was conquered by the Chou, of different ethnic origin, who inhabited the northwest border of the Shang domain. The Chou gradually extended their sovereignty, including the entire middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and parts of the middle basin of the Yangtze. At first their capital lay near Hsi-an. The Chou territory was divided into numerous domains among the king and the elites—a system of delegated authority similar to the later European feudal system.
Until the 8th century BC the Chou constantly extended their territory. About 770 BC, however, internal disorders broke the kingdom into numerous units and forced the Chou king to abandon his homeland in the Wei valley and move to the eastern capital at Lo-yang, where his power diminished. Over the next two and a half centuries wars caused more than 100 petty units to be swallowed up by some 20 of the more powerful ones, among whom there emerged a clear pecking order.
The Shang and early Chou periods were differentiated from their predecessors by their political organization and their bronze technology, and also by the use of writing; their culture was already recognizably “Chinese”. Their cities maintained a hierarchy of nobles, royal officers and court servants. They drew support from communities of craftsmen working in bronze, jade, wood, stone, ceramics and textiles. Peasants working the various domains that belonged to the landed classes produced revenues and foodstuffs. Market activities were common and mint currencies were in use.
Bronze was used for ritual objects and a wide range of weapons and tools, with the exception of farming equipment. Farmers working in the fields continued to use stone implements, growing rice, millet, barley and hemp and raising pigs, poultry and silkworms.
Towards the end of the period, the old social order began to collapse. The more powerful units employed bureaucrats rather than the hereditary nobility of older times. A new group of administrators (shih) emerged. A leading figure among this group, Confucius, formulated a new ethos, which was to have currency far into the future and far beyond China’s territory.

TO 1392
KOREA
The area now known as Korea was the mountainous eastern edge of the Eurasian continent until the Yellow Sea formed and the west coast emerged to define a peninsula. Peoples migrated into and through the peninsula to the islands. Chinese political culture and Buddhism followed on, and states emerged. With Chinese aid, one of three competing kingdoms conquered the peninsula, but instability led to anarchy by the late 9th century. The successful kingdom created a bureaucratic state with strong aristocratic characteristics and established a Korean identity.
During the last glacial maximum, “Korea” was high ground across a low plain (Yellow Sea) at the eastern end of Eurasia. Sea levels rose and a peninsula appeared between 14,000 BC and 6000 BC. Humans from 22,000 BC; villages from 10,000 BC; rice between 6000 and 4500 BC. Bronze was worked from 1000 BC and dolmens appeared.
By 108 BC, the Han Empire had established colonies to trade for iron. Only the Lelang colony near Pyŏngyang survived until AD 313, when it was destroyed by a tribe from the middle reaches of the Yalu River, the Koguryo, who first revolted against the Chinese in AD 12. Over several centuries, the south politically evolved into Paekche in the southwest, Silla in the southeast, and the iron-rich principalities of Kaya in between.
By the 6th century, the peninsular states were importing Chinese law, bureaucratic government, and land was monopolized by the state to centralize power. Koreans and Japanese fashioned compromises between the Chinese ideal of centralization and the native system of aristocracy, which resulted in semi-centralized political orders based on inheritance. Buddhism permeated every corner of the peninsula by 540 and was exported to Japan.

An alliance between T'ang China and Silla destroyed Paekche in 660 and Koguryo in 668. The T’ang had promised to withdraw but betrayed Silla, attempting to seize the whole peninsula. By 676, Silla drove T’ang out, demonstrating that outside powers were unable to succeed on the peninsula without a local ally. T’ang completely retreated, and a new state called Pohai (Korean Parhae, 712–926) formed in Manchuria from tribal elements and Koguryo refugees.
From the 8th century, northeast Asia saw peace: great cities, long - distance trade, and a cosmopolitan, state-oriented Buddhism. Kyŏngju, Silla’s capital, was a world city known to Arab traders. Ch’ang-an may have had nearly two million inhabitants, and Kyŏngju approached 900,000, swollen by slaves from the wars. Monks, merchants and diplomats wandered among Ch’ang-an, Kyŏngju, and Nara in Japan. Thereafter, “Korea” and “Japan” began to form separate identities.
Sillan central control lapsed, and in 918, Wang Kŏn, a general outside the old aristocratic order, emerged to found a new dynasty named Koryŏ. Wang Kŏn peacefully absorbed the Sillan court in 935. His successors inherited the aristocratic pretensions of Silla and the desire to centralize. During the 10th century, a bureaucratic state was created, with examinations, ideology, salary ranks and centralized provincial appointments. Where Silla had conquered, Koryŏ unified. In 1126, the Liao (Jurchen) destroyed the Chinese Song Empire and Koryŏ faced a dilemma of identity: take the opportunity to expand out of the peninsula or accept its limitations. A rebellious faction argued for continental destiny in Manchuria. Kim Pu-sik, the general who suppressed them, produced an official history (Samguk sagi, c. 1145) that defined Koryŏ’s heritage as peninsular. After the Mongols invaded in 1232, an unofficial history (Samguk yusa, c. 1283) reaffirmed a peninsular identity and recorded foundation myths.
Koryŏ nearly slipped into feudalism when abuse of civil privilege sparked a military coup d’etat in 1170. Military dictators did not create a new government, but ruled through the central government. Perhaps Koryŏ never disintegrated into feudalism because of the threat from northern barbarians, a threat Japan never faced. The Mongols invaded in 1232, but the Korean court resisted until 1270. The Koryŏ kings became sons-in-law to the Mongol Khans, and Koryŏ was press-ganged into supporting Mongol efforts to conquer Japan in 1274 and 1281. Both invasion s failed.
From the mid - 14th century, Japanese piracy appeared to ravage Korea. In the north, the Mongols weakened and, in 1368, the new Ming dynasty dislodged the Mongols. Indecision at the Koryŏ court over whether to support the Mongols or the Ming resulted in a coup d'etat in 1388 and a new dynasty, the Chosŏn, was founded in 1392.

TO 500 BC
THE BEGINNINGS OF INDIAN CIVILIZATION
India was the home of one of the oldest civilizations of history, which grew up along the banks of the Indus river. The Indus valley culture and the Vedic culture, which succeeded and was influenced by it, were the basis for the development of later Indian society, in particular for the major religious systems of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.
The early history of India is very difficult to recover. Archaeology can reveal something about the way of life of its earliest inhabitants, but little can be learned from written evidence. The earliest works of Indian literature, the Vedas, were composed in the centuries after 1200 BC, but they were not written down until probably the 5th century.

HARAPPA AND MOHENJO-DARO
Although the subcontinent had substantial human occupation from the Stone Age onwards, the first great Indian civilization was the Harappan culture which emerged in the Indus valley in the 3rd millennium BC. Like the slightly older civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt it was based on flood - plain agriculture, as the cultivation of the fertile land on either side of the Indus was able to provide enough of a surplus to support a complex urban society. Several substantial cities were built, of which the best explored are Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
The Indus civilization also developed writing, and about 2000 seals with short pictographic inscriptions on them have been discovered. The script has not been deciphered, and until it is, little will be known about the political structure or religious beliefs of the Indus civilization.
The presence of cylinder seals from Mesopotamia at Mohenjo-Daro and of Indus seals in Mesopotamia is evidence of trade between the two areas via the Persian Gulf, and tin and lapis lazuli from Afghanistan and Central Asia also made their way to the Indus. However around 2000 BC the ‘Harappan period’ came to an end, as the cities ceased to function and were replaced by a settlement pattern of agricultural villages and pastoral camps.

POST-INDUS INDIA
From around 1500 BC a new culture becomes apparent in India, characterized by a new language and rituals, and the use of horses and two - wheeled chariots. The traditional way to explain the changes was to talk of an “Aryan invasion”, with mounted bands of warriors riding in from the northwest and conquering the indigenous Indus population before moving eastwards to the Ganges. Support for this picture was claimed from one of the Vedas, the Rig Veda, where the Aryans are presented as conquering the cities of the darker skinned indigenous Dasas. Archaeological evidence offers little support for this theory however. The styles of pottery associated with the Indo - Aryans, known as Painted Grey Ware, which appears from c. 1100 BC, is similar to earlier Painted Black and Red Ware, and this may indicate that Indo-Aryan speakers were indigenous to the Indus plain. Whatever their origins, Indo-Aryan languages, from which Sanskrit developed, became widespread through Northern India.

THE SOUTH
Southern India was left largely untouched by the civilizations of the north. There were probably trading links between the Indus valley and the southern tip of the peninsula, but there was no urbanism in the south, where villages were the normal form of social organization. However, some limited form of common culture in the south is suggested by the distinctive megalithic tombs found over most of the area.
In the north, where, unlike the hilly, fragmented geography of the south, great plains lent themselves to large-scale agriculture and the growth of substantial kingdoms, cultural coherence became more widespread as, in the period after 1000 BC, the new civilization spread gradually east from the Indus to the Ganges. Evidence from finds of pottery characteristic of particular periods suggests that there was also movement southwards. The late Vedic texts depict the early first millennium BC as a period of frequent warfare between rival tribal territories. During this period the society of Northern India became increasingly stratified, and this culminated around 600 BC in the emergence of states ruled by hereditary monarchs. Trading networks developed, agricultural activity increased, and this led to a new phase of urbanism in India. Once again cities began to be built, although they were not on the scale of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, being constructed largely from mud-bricks. No known public buildings survive from this period. Yet by the 5th century BC there were political entities that might be called states or polities, most significantly Magadha, with its substantial fortified capital at Pataliputra (see p. 69).

VEDIC RELIGION
Religious practices in India in the first millennium BC were influenced in part by the earlier culture of the Vedas, and animal sacrifice had a central role in it. The religion was polytheistic, and the Rig Veda includes hymns to a number of deities, including the warrior god Indra, the fire god Agni, and Soma, identified with a mind - altering drug of some kind, possibly derived from mushrooms. These cults were the forerunner of Hinduism, and the urban societies that developed along the Ganges were the communities among whom appeared in the 5th century Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, and the Buddha himself.

c. 3000 TO 950 BC
MINOAN AND MYCENAEAN CIVILIZATIONS
In the late 19th century, Heinrich Schliemann and Sir Arthur Evans unearthed the remains of previously unknown civilizations. Although the names of Troy, Mycenae and Knossos were familiar from the poems of Homer, the Bronze Age societies of the Aegean revealed by these excavations had much more in common with contemporary Near Eastern societies than they had with later Greece.
Substantial settlements appeared in mainland Greece and Crete by the end of the 3rd millennium BC. These were subsistence farmers, with households producing goods for their own consumption. The subsequent appearance in Crete of large stone - built complexes marked the emergence of a new form of social organization. There are some parallels between these “First Palaces” and Near Eastern buildings, and they are accompanied by other signs of such influence, including the appearance of a form of hieroglyphic writing in Crete. However, it is likely that local needs as much as outside influence determined the island’s overall development.
There is no agreed explanation for the later destruction of the “First Palaces”, but in their place the large complexes of the “Second Palace Period” emerged. These were not fortified, but they were the focus of the economic and religious life of the Minoan communities.
By 1700 BC Knossos had achieved a dominant position within Crete, and the palace there reveals much information about Minoan society. Surviving frescoes depict scenes of communal activity including processions, bull - leaping, dining and dancing. It is clear from Knossos and other palaces that Cretan society depended upon intensive agriculture—the palaces incorporate large storage areas where crops could be gathered for later redistribution to the population. Outside the towns, especially in eastern Crete, large “villas” had a similar role, and acted as processing centres for grape and olive crops.
The two hundred years of the Second Palace Period witnessed considerable destruction and rebuilding at a number of sites. The eruption of Thera in 1628 BC left its mark on sites in eastern Crete but otherwise appears to have had little long-term impact. More significantly, a little over a century later many Cretan settlements were widely devastated, possibly as a result of invasion from the Greek mainland.

MYCENAEAN GREECE
Mainland Greece did not share in the prosperity of Crete and the Aegean islands until after c. 1700 BC, when rich burials, especially in the “shaft-graves” at Mycenae and in tholos tombs, point to the emergence of a powerful warlike elite. After 1500 BC mainlanders, called Mycenaeans, appear to have been in control of Knossos, where the palace functioned for another century. It was only after then that palaces started to appear on the mainland. While they owed something to Minoan models, and, like them, acted as centres for agricultural storage and redistribution, they were fortified and less luxurious. The Mycenaeans spoke a form of Greek, and wrote in a syllabic script, Linear B, adapted from the still - undeciphered script in use in Crete, Linear A. Documents inscribed on clay tablets reveal a strongly hierarchical society, with the ruler (wanax) at the top, lesser lords below and the mass of the people at the bottom.
Soon after 1200 BC, more or less simultaneously, the palaces on the mainland were destroyed. In the centuries following there is no trace of Linear B writing, nor of the figurative decoration that characterizes Mycenaean art. When written Greek appears again in the 8th century, it uses a version of the Phoenician alphabet.
The absence of firm evidence—mirrored by the lack of firm dates for this period—has led historians to examine myths in the search for historical facts. On this basis it has been suggested that the Mycenaeans fell victim to Dorian invaders from the north, or that a long war against Troy caused revolution in the Greek homeland. Neither finds support from archaeology, and an agreed explanation for the complete social breakdown of Mycenaean society is yet to emerge. One contributing factor may have been major political upheavals further east, cutting off access to the tin needed to make the bronze on which the Mycenaean rulers based their power. Certainly the society which emerged from the “dark age” that followed the collapse was reliant on the more widely available iron.
The massive ruins of the Mycenaean palaces remained visible to the Greeks of later times, and these, together with a tradition of oral poetry that developed over the following centuries, led to the invention of a heroic world, most famously celebrated in the epic poems of Homer, that was very different from Bronze Age reality.

THREE
 
THE CLASSICAL CIVILIZATIONS OF EURASIA
The earliest civilizations arose at a few scattered points in the vast and sparsely inhabited Eurasian landmass. Between 1000 BC and AD 500 the pattern began to change. Although America, Australasia and Africa south of the Sahara still stood outside the mainstream of world history, and were to stay so for a further thousand years, the civilizations of Europe and Asia now formed a continuous belt. By AD 100, when the classical era was at its height, a chain of empires extended from Rome via Parthia and the Kushana empire to China, constituting an unbroken zone of civilized life from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
This was a new and important fact in the history of the Eurasian world. The area of civilization remained narrow and exposed to unrelenting barbarian pressures, and developments in the different regions remained largely autonomous. But with the expansion of the major civilizations and the elimination of the geographical gaps between them, the way lay open for inter-regional contacts and cultural exchanges which left a lasting imprint. In the west, the expansion of Hellenism created a single cultural area which extended from the frontiers of India to Britain; in the east, the expansion of the Chinese and Indian civilizations resulted in a kind of cultural symbiosis in Indo-China. These wider cultural areas provided a vehicle not only for trade but for the transmission of ideas, technology and institutions, and above all for the diffusion of the great world religions. Beginning with Buddhism, and continuing with Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Islam, religion became a powerful unifying bond in the Eurasian world.

550 BC TO AD 752
THE COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL BONDS OF EURASIA
The rulers of the empires of the ancient world had no commercial policies, and were seldom interested in trade. Yet the activities of traders, operating at the margins of society, and rarely mentioned in ancient literature, had a profound effect on the development of the world, transmitting not only goods, but also cultural ideas—and occasionally deadly organisms.
The quantity of goods passing across the Eurasian landmass varied enormously depending on the political conditions of the time. Between 200 BC and AD 200 stable regimes in the Roman Mediterranean, the Persian Parthian empire, the Kushan empire and China under the Han dynasty, helped to stabilize the routes between Europe, Persia and China. Such favourable conditions for the movement of goods and people did not recur until the 8th century AD. These earlier empires, however, were not directly interested in facilitating trade. Chinese campaigns in the area of the Silk Road in Sinkiang, north of Tibet, such as that of Pan Ch’ao against the Kushans in c. AD 90, confronted a military rather than a commercial threat. The Han emperors certainly wanted valuable commodities like horses from Ferghana, but they expected to receive them as diplomatic gifts, tribute or booty from war.

Since the time of Assyrian merchants in Anatolia in the second millennium BC there are examples of communities of traders who settled in foreign territories to import goods from their homelands. In the 8th century BC Greek and Phoenician trading posts were established across the Mediterranean for the same purpose. These “trade diasporas” made possible effective communication between different cultural groups. The people who made up the diaspora communities were not wealthy merchants, but of much lower status. The “Roman” traders who sailed across the Indian Ocean or visited the Chinese court would not have been Italians, but inhabitants of the eastern provinces, who were probably not even Roman citizens.
Trade was not the only way in which goods travelled across this route. The Han rulers of China maintained peace on their northwest frontier by regular gifts of large quantities of silk and lacquerware to the Hsiungnu tribes outside the Great Wall. Some items would have been passed on in dowries or as gifts, and gradually made their way to the Mediterranean where silken clothing was sought by Roman senators, much to the distaste of more austere emperors.
While silk was the major import from China to the Mediterranean, a variety of goods found their way westwards. The Roman writer Pliny (AD 23–79) complains that the desire for eastern goods was draining the empire of its gold and silver, but this is not supported by the archaeological evidence. Glass was certainly sought after, but slaves were probably also a significant item of trade, and there are references in Chinese sources to “Syrian jugglers” reaching the Chinese court.

MARITIME TRADE
Maritime trade developed at the same time as the overland routes, making increased use of the monsoons for trade between southern Arabia and south India. Vital information about the goods traded between the Roman empire and the east comes from A Voyage around the Red Sea, an anonymous handbook for traders written in the 1st century AD, which describes the coastal routes from the Egyptian Red Sea ports of Myos Hormus and Berenice to east Africa and the Ganges delta. The author knows of China as a vast city, but east of India his geographical knowledge is hazy.
The exchange of goods might have profound cultural effects. Begram in Gandhara was the location of the summer palace of the Kushan emperors. A rich hoard from there dating from around AD 100 included lacquer from China and ivory from India, as well as bronzes, glassware and pottery from the Mediterranean. The Kushan interest in Mediterranean artefacts illustrated by the Begram hoard had a profound effect on local practices, acting as a catalyst for the development of Gandharan art which emerged in the 2nd century AD, in part modelled on Greco-Roman styles.

1000–539 BC
THE NEAR EAST
As the Near East recovered from the upheavals of the late Bronze Age, Assyria re - emerged as the great regional power. At its greatest extent Assyrian territory stretched from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, and from southern Egypt to Lake Van. At the height of Assyrian power, internal conflict saw the Babylonians replace the Assyrians as the rulers of the empire, but less than a century later they, in their turn, were overthrown by the Persians.
Our knowledge of this period is drawn largely from Assyrian, and later Babylonian, documents, but some idea of how neighbouring states saw Assyria can be gained from the Hebrew Bible, which contains historical material from the 8th century BC onwards. Although its narrative was revised several times in later centuries, the Bible provides information about the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, which emerged in the area of Palestine in around 1000 BC, initially as a single kingdom with its centre at Jerusalem. Over the next 300 years Israel and Judah came increasingly into the Assyrian sphere of influence, with their kings adopting varying attitudes to the neighbouring superpower.

Assyrian expansion started in the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC), who rebuilt and expanded the city and palace of Nimrud to be his capital. His successor Shalmaneser III (858–824 BC) extended the power of the kingdom westwards, partly by conquest and partly by accepting tribute from the local rulers in Syria and the Levant. In the following century Assyrian expansion turned south and east under three powerful rulers, Tiglath-pileser III (744–727 BC), Sargon II (721–705 BC) and Sennacherib (704–681 BC). Repeating the achievements of the 13th-century kings they conquered the city of Babylon and brought Mesopotamia under Assyrian control.

At this time a new power was growing on Assyria’s northern border in the shape of Urartu. Little is known about this state, which had its capital at Tushpa on Lake Van. Many Urartian sites were heavily fortified, and the state flourished from the 9th to the 7th centuries BC. If the Assyrians did try to conquer it, they had little success. Along with its western neighbours, Phrygia and Lydia, Urartu had grown up after the collapse of the Hittite empire, but a number of “neo-Hittite” city-states also emerged in the region of northern Syria.

A little before 700 BC Egypt was beginning to recover from the disorganization of the Third Intermediate Period after the end of the New Kingdom, and attempted to influence affairs in the Levant. In response Esarhaddon (680–669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (668–627 BC) led campaigns into Egypt, going as far south as Thebes and more or less installing pro-Assyrian rulers in the country. Ashurbanipal also invaded Elam, extending his empire further than ever before. His death in 627 BC however marked the end of Assyrian power: within 15 years his capital, Nineveh, had been sacked, and his empire had come under the control of Babylon.

It has been suggested that the transformation of the neo-Assyrian empire into the neo-Babylonian empire should be seen as the result more of an internal dynastic conflict than of conquest. With the help of the Medes, who were settled on the northeastern borders of Assyria, the first neo-Babylonian ruler, Nabopolassar (626–605 BC), took advantage of quarrels within the Assyrian ruling house to seize control of the whole empire. In the process, Median and Babylonian armies destroyed Ashur, Nimrud and Nineveh, but, with the exception of Egypt, the empire that these cities controlled held together under its new rulers.

When the Egyptians tried to take advantage of the upheaval, Nabopolassar and his successor Nebuchadnezzar (604–562 BC) marched to the Levant, drove the Egyptians away, and at the same time captured Jerusalem and deported its leaders. The wealth of the empire was used to rebuild the cities of Mesopotamia, and above all Babylon. Excavation in the early 20th century revealed the splendour and the sheer size of the city as it was rebuilt by Nebuchadnezzar.

After Nebuchadnezzar’s death there was a period of instability, which ended with a palace coup that placed Nabonidus (555–539 BC) on the throne. Although he had a long reign, his religious reforms appear to have made him unpopular with many leading members of the kingdom. This may have critically weakened Babylonian military strength when, in 539 BC, the city was taken by the Persians under Cyrus I (752).

550 BC TO AD 637
THE EMPIRES OF PERSIA
The Iranian plateau was the heartland of three great empires whose territory stretched from the ancient centres of civilization in Mesopotamia to India. For more than a millennium, the Persian empire was governed successively by the Achaemenid, Arsacid and Sasanid ruling families, and offered a constant challenge to the Mediterranean lands to the west.
The downfall of the Assyrian empire around 612 BC was brought about by the Babylonians and the Medes, a loose confederacy of tribes in western Iran. It was the Persians, however, who proved to be the main beneficiaries. The Persian state emerged in the 7th century BC on the edge of the area dominated by Assyria, and in 550 BC its ruler, Cyrus (559–530 BC), defeated an invading Median army at Pasargadae. The next 11 years saw attempts to stop the growth of Persian power by both Croesus of Lydia and Nabonidus of Babylon. Both were defeated, leaving Cyrus in possession of Anatolia, the Levant and Mesopotamia.
The absorption of Lydian territory into Cyrus’s empire brought Persia into contact with the Greeks. He then turned his attention eastwards, gaining control of much of Afghanistan and south central Asia. Though Cyrus’s successor, Cambyses (530–522 BC), added Egypt to the empire in 525 BC, his death was followed by the first of several upheavals within the empire as uncertainty over the succession encouraged widespread revolts.
These were quickly suppressed by Darius (522–486 BC), who also incorporated northwest India into the empire. The northwestern boundary of the empire remained a problem, but after the failure of expeditions into Europe by Darius and Xerxes (486–465 BC), the Persians protected their interests by a series of peace treaties with the Greek states.
Achaemenid rule was brought to an end by the invasion of Alexander the Great in 334 BC. Dynastic struggles in the 330s may have had an effect, but no entirely satisfactory explanation has been given for the rapidity with which the Achaemenid empire fell.

THE PARTHIAN EMPIRE
After Alexander’s death, Iran and its neighbouring territories became part of the Seleucid kingdom. In the 3rd century BC internal disputes and conflict with other Hellenistic kingdoms weakened Seleucid control of their eastern territories. Bactria broke away to become an independent kingdom, and the provinces of Parthia and Hyrcania were taken over by Arsaces, leader of the Parni in 238.
The early history of the new kingdom of Parthia is uncertain, but under Mithradates I (171–138 BC) its territory was extended into Mesopotamia and as far east as the mouth of the Indus, its success, like that of Sasanid Persia later, largely the result of the use of mounted archers and armoured cavalry. In the years after Mithradates’s death the empire was threatened by the Tocharians and the Shakas in the east, but order was restored by Mithradates II (123–87 BC). From the 1st century BC onwards, in spite of further severe Shaka incursions from the east, the main threat to Parthian security was Rome. But although there were a number of wars between the two empires, they were well matched militarily and Arsacid, or Parthian, rule remained secure until it was challenged from within.

SASANID PERSIA
Considerable autonomy was left in the hands of local ruling families, and it was from one of these in Persis that the new rulers of Persia arose. The first Sasanid ruler, Ardashir, defeated his Arsacid overlord Ardavan in AD 224 and rapidly took control of the whole of Parthia’s empire and the areas beyond. Roman and Byzantine rule in Mesopotamia, Syria and eastern Anatolia was constantly challenged over the next centuries. The last century of Parthian rule had seen the rise of the Kushana empire in the east (see p. 68). This ended in 225 and Gandhara, Bactria and Sogdiana were brought under Sasanid control. From the 4th century this territory was threatened by Hephthalite and Chionite Huns and in the 6th century by the Turks.
The Arabs were a constant presence to the southwest of Persia’s empires. The Achaemenids had established some control over northern Arabia, but in the Parthian period an independent state of Characene emerged at the head of the Persian Gulf, whose rulers styled themselves “kings of the Arabs”. The Sasanids ended the independence of Characene, but maintained friendly relations with the Lakhmid Arab kingdom of Hira in western Mesopotamia which supported them against the Romans. Southern Arabia was never brought under Persian control, and in c. 604, after the Sasanid Chosroes II had ended Lakhmid independence, the Persians were defeated in battle by a confederacy of Arabs from the south. Success created confidence and increased Arab unity to such an extent that with further victories at Al Qadisiyya (637) and Nihavand (642) they brought Sasanid power to an end.

800 TO 336 BC
THE SPREAD OF GREEK
 CIVILIZATION
The Greek heartland is an area of islands and plains divided by mountains. After the collapse of the Mycenaean palace system, a new form of political and religious community emerged here, the polis, or city-state, which became the Mediterranean world’s dominant form of political organization.
The 8th century BC was a period of great transformation in Greece. It saw the appearance of the first monumental public buildings, and with them other indications of the emergence of new communities, including changes in burial practices and artistic styles. At the same time literacy was reintroduced into Greece, with a new alphabet. Though contact with the wider world had not been totally broken in previous centuries, it now increased dramatically, above all on the island of Euboea. Although it is impossible to be certain what produced this transformation, one important factor was the activities of the Phoenicians, who at this time began to explore and settle throughout the Mediterranean.

THE AGE OF EXPANSION
From the middle of the century, following in the wake of the Phoenicians, groups of Greeks began to create settlements around the Mediterranean. The earliest were in Italy and Sicily, but by the middle of the 6th century there were numerous Greek communities in north Africa and, to the east, along the Black Sea coast. These colonies were set up for a variety of reasons. Some of the earliest were trading posts, which over time developed into permanent settlements. Others were formally dispatched as a response to land shortage in the mother city. Others may have been founded by bands of discontented young men looking for a new and better life away from old Greece. It is probable that the experience of the colonists had an effect on the political development of their mother cities.
From its earliest existence, decision - making in the Greek polis lay with an assembly of adult male citizens. Leadership, however, would have been in the hands of the wealthy elite. Increasing wealth and overseas contact in the 7th and 6th centuries led to the emergence in many city - states of powerful individuals, known as tyrants, who were able to impose their will on the community, usually with popular support. The “age of the tyrants” was a period of urban development, with new buildings, in particular enormous temples such as those of Hera on Samos, Artemis at Ephesus and Olympian Zeus at Athens. Citystates published law - codes on large stone tablets, advertising to the world that they were communities governed by the rule of law. Poetry flourished, with the Iliad and Odyssey of Homer and the poems of Hesiod appearing in the early 7th century, followed by the great lyric poets, among them Archilochus, Anacreon and Sappho. Certain religious sanctuaries, above all Olympia and Delphi, gained “pan-Hellenic” status, and became meeting places for the leading members of the different Greek communities.

THE ATHENIAN EMPIRE
The experience of the Persian invasion of Greece under Xerxes encouraged the Greeks in the Aegean and Asia Minor to join together to defend themselves from future threats. Athens, which had by far the largest fleet, took command, turning this alliance of city - states into an Athenian empire. Member states were required to pay tribute to finance the Athenian fleet, which guaranteed security. The existence of the Athenian empire considerably affected life in Athens. The fleet gave employment and status to the poorer citizens, who served as oarsmen and were able to participate in political activity to an extent unequalled elsewhere in the Greek world. A proportion of the tribute, along with some of the booty from successful naval campaigns, was given to the gods, funding great building programmes in Athens. The last three decades of the 5th century were also the period of Athens’ most enduring literary achievements. Following the work of Aeschylus earlier in the century, Sophocles and Euripides wrote tragedies, and Aristophanes his comedies, for performance at the great dramatic festivals, the City Dionysia and the Lenaea. Herodotus, the first historian, lived in Athens for some time, while sophists, philosophers and rhetoricians flocked there to make their names and their fortunes. Athens also produced its own great historian, Thucydides.
At the same time, Athens’ growing power was seen as a threat by the states of the Peloponnese, above all Sparta. After some inconclusive conflicts in the mid-century, in 431 BC Sparta declared war on Athens. This, the Peloponnesian War, developed into a conflict which ended 27 years later in the defeat of Athens and the disbanding of its empire.

THE RISE OF MACEDON
The economies of all Greek city - states were dominated by agriculture, and, except perhaps in Sparta, which relied on the labour of its conquered Messenian subjects (the “helots”), most of the population was made up of small - scale farmers, who were available for military service in the periods of less intense agricultural activity. One effect of this was that even prolonged periods of warfare had little long-term impact on the economies of the city - states involved. Thus within a decade of surrendering to the Peloponnesians, Athens was again at war with Sparta, this time supported by several of her former opponents.
The Spartans had originally defeated the Athenians with Persia’s help. In 387 BC the Persian king attempted to impose a peace settlement on Greece, and the next 30 years saw Athens, Sparta and Thebes vying for dominance in Greece, looking always for backing from Persia. In 359 BC Philip II became king of Macedon. He united the country and took advantage of conflicts elsewhere in Greece to gain control of Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south. This gave him a firm base for involvement in Greek affairs, and, after Philip had brought to an end the “Sacred War” of 356–46, Macedon was left as the major power in Greece. In 338 BC Philip defeated the Athenians and Thebans at Chaeronea, and imposed a settlement on the whole of Greece, the “League of Corinth”. His death two years later left his son Alexander a more or less united Greece, from which he was able to launch his invasion of the Persian empire.

336 TO 30 BC
THE HELLENISTIC WORLD
Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Persian empire transformed the eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern world. The spread of Greek culture and political organisation which followed in his wake shaped the region for a millennium. Greek became the common language, and the city - state the common form of social organisation.
Along with the kingdom of Macedon, in 336 BC Alexander inherited from his father the leadership of a league of Greek states that he had intended to use to campaign against the Persian empire. Through his ambition and brilliant generalship, by the time of his death less than 13 years later at the age of 32, he was recognized as legitimate ruler of an empire stretching from Egypt to India. From the moment he died there was competition between his closest companions and generals. Until the assassination of Alexander’s young son in 307 BC, the contenders, for all that each had ambitions to take over the whole empire, could at least claim to be acting as regents. Thereafter, they were fighting for themselves, rapidly styling themselves as kings, and attempting to carve out areas of personal influence. By 276 BC, a division of the empire into three main kingdoms—Antigonid Macedon, Seleucid Asia and Ptolemaic Egypt—had been established.

CULTURAL LIFE IN THE SUCCESSOR STATES
The basic political units of these new kingdoms was the city - state, some nominally independent, but most owing allegiance to one of the successor kings. The cities of old Greece, such as Athens, retained their prestige, but they were eclipsed by the newly created or reorganized cities of the east, named inevitably after their founders or rulers: Alexandria, Seleucia, Antioch. The new cities had all the elements of their older counterparts, with gymnasia, theatres and temples to the gods, and regular festivals, some including athletics, which might be attended by Greeks from far afield. Citizenship was restricted almost entirely to the Greek and Macedonian minority, and the land was in the hands of citizens or of the kings and their friends. The local populations might farm the land as tenants or as labourers, but they were excluded from administrative positions. The network of cities helped the spread of a common Greek culture and language throughout the region: Clearchus, a pupil of Aristotle, brought a collection of maxims from Delphi in central Greece to the city of Ai Khanoum in eastern Afghanistan. In a number of cities, but above all in Alexandria, with its access to papyrus, and Pergamum, from where parchment got its name, the kings established great libraries, and these became centres for literary work.

Even before Alexander’s conquest, some communities within the Persian empire had adopted aspects of Greek culture. This “Hellenization” continued, at least among the elites: conflict between “Hellenizers” and “traditionalists” in the 2nd century led to violence in Jerusalem. However, especially in Seleucid territories, elements of older cultures, including cuneiform writing, remained important, and in those areas which were to become the Parthian empire (see p. 57), Greek culture was never firmly established.
There were advances in geometry and mathematics, especially with Euclid of Alexandria and Archimedes. The great Alexandrian librarian, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, attempted with some success to calculate the circumference of the earth. However, this was not a period of great technological change. The basis of the Hellenistic economy was agriculture, and this changed little. Merchants continued to trade, and writers of the time praise the range of goods available in the great cities, but there is evidence too of an increasing gulf between rich and poor. Only in warfare were there major developments, with the creation of ever more advanced artillery and siege engines, and the introduction by the Seleucids and the Ptolemies of elephants onto the battlefield.
From the late 3rd century, a new player entered the game. Threats to Roman operations in the Adriatic, and Macedonian support for the Carthaginian Hannibal, led to a Roman invasion of Greece and Asia Minor. The Macedonian phalanx proved inferior to the Roman legions.

THE GROWTH OF ROMAN POWER
Wars gave Roman commanders an opportunity for booty and glory, and initially they withdrew their forces after each campaign; but as Rome acquired more allies in the east, the reasons for maintaining their presence grew. After the battle of Pydna (168) the kingdom of Macedon was divided into four independent republics. 18 years later it was made a Roman province. The involvement of Cleopatra VII in the civil war between Mark Antony and the future emperor Augustus led after the battle of Actium (see p. 75) to the Roman annexation of Egypt, the last major successor kingdom. A few small client kingdoms, tolerated by the Romans for a while, were all that remained of Alexander’s territorial inheritance.

475 BC TO AD 220
THE UNIFICATION OF CHINA
The process of China’s nation - and empire - building began with the political anarchy of the Warring States period but ended with a highly centralized state headed by a single monarch and an efficient bureaucracy that reached village level. The new system attained its full glory under the Han, whose wealth and territory matched the Roman empire.
Throughout the Warring States period (475–221 BC) seven major rivals contended for supremacy. At first, following the decline of the power of the Chou king, the principal contenders were the old-established dukedoms of Ch’i, Ch’u, Han and Wei. But from the beginning of the 3rd century BC the border state of Ch’in established firm control over the northwest and west, adopting the title “king” in 325 BC, and during the latter half of the 3rd century BC it began gradually destroying its rivals.
Throughout China, it was a period of constant warfare, waged on a massive scale by powerful and well-organized political units. But at the same time, this Warring States period coincided with major economic and social changes. The introduction of iron tools from about 500 BC and the use of animal power for cultivation greatly increased agricultural productivity. Population multiplied, commerce and industry flourished and large cities emerged. It was also a period of innovation in technology and science, and of philosophical ferment, in which the main schools of thought—Confucianism, Daoism and Legalism—took shape.
That the Ch’in emerged from this period to unify China under their leadership was at least in part due to the success of the “Legalist” system adopted by them in the 4th century, whereby a universal code of rewards and punishments was established that induced a high level of popular obedience and military discipline. Under this system, a centralized bureaucracy took measures to improve the production and distribution of grain, and organized the population to provide manpower for construction works and for the army, enforcing the system through a ruthless penal code.

THE FIRST EMPEROR
When the Ch’in king, Shih Huang-ti, was crowned the first emperor of China in 221 BC, the “Legalist” institutions were extended throughout the country. But although the emperor tried to eliminate all hostile factions, under the burdens imposed on the people by his military campaigns and vast construction works, his dynasty collapsed in a nationwide rebellion in 206 BC, shortly after his death.
After a period of civil war a new dynasty, the Han, was established by Liu Pang (256–195 BC). Copying the general outlines of the Ch’in system, but softening its harshness and in part restoring a system of feudal principalities, the Han gradually evolved an effective central government and system of local administration. The “Legalist” approach was replaced by Confucianism which emphasized benevolent rule and good statesmanship.

HAN EXPANSION
The Ch’in had taken strong defensive measures against the nomad Hsiungnu (Huns) in the north. Under the emperor Wu-ti (140–87 BC), though probably driven by his generals in the north, Han China again took the offensive against the Hsiungnu, and opened up the route to central Asia known as the Silk Road. A large export trade, mainly in silk, reached as far as the Roman empire. The Han also reaffirmed the Ch’in conquests in the southern region, eliminated the Yüeh kingdoms of the southeast coast, and occupied northern Vietnam. Chinese armies also drove deep into the southwest, seeking to establish Han control. In addition, Wu-ti’s armies placed parts of northern Korea under Chinese administration.

The Han empire grew extremely prosperous and China’s population reached some 57 million. Many large cities grew up and the largest, the capital Ch’ang-an, housed a population of a quarter of a million and was the centre of a brilliant culture. At the beginning of the Christian era the Han empire rivalled that of Rome in size and wealth.
But under a series of weak emperors during the latter half of the 1st century BC, the authority of the throne was challenged by powerful court families. In AD 9 Wang Mang usurped the throne. His reign (the Hsin dynasty, AD 9–23) ended in a widespread rebellion that restored the Han (Later Han, AD 25–220), and the capital was moved to Lo-yang.

THE COLLAPSE OF THE HAN EMPIRE
After some decades of consolidation, in the late 1st century the Chinese resumed active hostilities to drive the Hsiungnu westward to central Asia. But trouble with the Chiang tribes of the northwest and virulent factionalism at court had seriously weakened the Han state by AD 160. A wave of agrarian distress culminated in 184 in a massive uprising led by the “Yellow Turbans”, a religious movement based on popular cults. Although the Han survived in name until 220, power now lay with regional commanders. In 220 the empire was divided into three independent kingdoms, ushering in a long period of territorial fragmentation.

220 TO 618
CHINA AND EAST ASIA
The period after 220 was one of the most chaotic and bloody in Chinese history. Not only was the north lost for long periods to non-Chinese regimes, but the governments in the south often lost effective control as well. Political instability was the norm across the country, and economic growth was minimal until the advent of the Sui dynasty.
The Han empire broke up into three kingdoms in 220: the Wei in the north; the Wu in the south; and the Shu in the west. The militarily strong Wei had conquered the Shu in the southwest by 263, but in 265 a military family, the Ssu-uma, took over the Wei kingdom through a coup d’état. They then proceeded with a series of military campaigns to unify China under the name of the Western Chin dynasty. The target of unification was finally achieved in 280.

THE WESTERN CHIN
The new authorities granted farmers land-holding rights to re-establish household farming in accordance with the Han model. “Salary land” for officials was granted and cultivated by tenants. Overall, this helped the recovery of the agricultural economy. The adoption of a laissez-faire Daoism by the new rulers as the state philosophy was also precedented in the Han. At the same time Buddhism became increasingly widespread.
Politically, however, the ruling class was deeply divided. In the period from 291 to 306, there were numerous assassinations and violent struggles within the royal family, known as the “Wars between Eight Princes”. The unitary empire existed only in name. The weakness of the Western Chin regime created opportunities for the non-Chinese peoples within and on the borders of the empire—the Hsienpei, Hsiungnu, Chieh, Ti and Ch’iang—to move in and establish their own kingdoms, as many as 16 at one time. This was known as the “Five Barbarians’ Disruption of China” and practically ended the Western Chin. The Chinese regime survived under the Eastern Chin only in south China. Its territory was much smaller than the area controlled by the non-Chinese regimes in the north and its authority over the population severely weakened. Tax avoidance became endemic.
During the years of the Eastern Chin, north China saw near permanent conflict among the non-Chinese regimes. The unification of the north finally arrived in 382 under the Ch’ien Ch’in and after their failed invasion of the south in the following year an era of co-existence was ushered in between the non-Chinese regime in the north and the Chinese one in the south. Based on this ethnic division, the period is called the “Northern and Southern Dynasties”.
In the south the Eastern Chin dynasty ended with its overthrow in 420 by one of its generals, who established the Sung dynasty. There followed another three short-lived dynasties, each in turn brought down by either a general or another member of the ruling family, although outside the court there was a measure of peace and prosperity.

THE NORTHERN WEI
In the north a dynasty of Hsienpei descent, the Northern Wei, managed to conquer all of north China in the early 5th century, but split into two lines in 534, to become, in 550 and 557 respectively, the Northern Ch’i and Northern Chou. Although the latter was smaller and poorer, it had a more efficient military organization, and overcame the Northern Ch’i in 577. Within a few years, however, its ruling family was overthrown by one of its partly-Chinese generals, Yang Chien, who went on to conquer the south and establish the Sui dynasty. Although it was itself short-lived, the Sui had at last reunified China.

500 BC TO AD 550
INDIA: THE FIRST EMPIRES
From 500 BC to AD 550 south Asia witnessed a succession of metropolitan empires centred in north India—the Mauryas, the Kushanas and the Guptas. Although centralized political control was often weak, for the first time the entire subcontinent was integrated within a single but diverse cultural field.
By about 500 BC north India sustained 16 well - articulated polities, or “mahajanapadas”, some of which were still essentially tribal republics and others were already monarchies. This region witnessed tremendous change, as the consolidation of settled agriculture led to the emergence of cities and more complex political systems. Such changes made the older sacrificial cult of the Vedas, which had its origins in the pastoral communities of the Aryan tribes, increasingly obsolete. In its place, at the end of the 5th century BC in the heart of the Gangetic plains, the founders of Buddhism and Jainism formulated their radical new teachings.

THE FIRST EMPIRE
During the 5th century BC the number of mahajanapadas diminished to four—Vajji, Kosala, Kasi and Magadha. After a century of wars, the single kingdom of Magadha dominated, with its splendid new capital of Pataliputra. This was to be the nucleus of the first Indian empire. Shortly after Alexander’s incursion into India in 327 BC, the Mauryan prince Chandragupta seized the Magadhan throne. Chandragupta then conquered the land east of the Indus, swung south to occupy much of central India, and in 305 BC decisively defeated Alexander’s successor in the northwest, Seleucus Nicator. The Mauryan empire that Chandragupta founded reached its zenith under his grandson, Ashoka, who established his rule over most of the subcontinent. Ashoka’s empire was composed of a centralized administrative system spread over a number of thriving cities and their hinterlands. After his conquest of Kalinga in 260 BC, Ashoka publicly converted to Buddhism and adopted a policy of “conquest through righteousness”, or dhammavijaya. In a number of public orders inscribed on pillars and rockfaces throughout the subcontinent, Ashoka called for peace, propagated moral teachings (dhamma), and prohibited Vedic animal sacrifices. These edicts, written in Prakrit, are the first specimens of royal decrees in south Asia.

THE KUSHANA EMPIRE
Mauryan rule did not long survive Ashoka’s death in 232 BC. In the 2nd century bc, the northwest was repeatedly invaded, both by Greeks from Bactria and Parthia, and then by new nomad groups themselves displaced from central Asia. First among these were Scythian tribes called the Shakas who overran Bactria and the Indus valley in the 1st century BC. Then the Kushana branch of the Yüeh-chih horde, who had settled in the Oxus valley after 165 BC, gradually extended their rule inland, subduing the Shakas in western India and reaching Varanasi in the 1st century AD. As well as the Oxus and Indus valleys, large parts of Khotan were included in their cosmopolitan empire, centred in Purusapura. Kushana India was a melting pot of cultures. The empire reached its height of power and influence under Kanishka, who patronized Buddhism and became extensively involved in political conflicts in central Asia.
Both the Shakas and the Kushanas took Indian names and were the first kings to adopt Sanskrit at their courts—the first courtly poems in Sanskrit date from this period—though the native kingdom of the Satavahanas of the Deccan continued to use Prakrit. In the northwest Mahayana Buddhism emerged at this time from more conservative teachings known as Theravada, and developed a more eclectic outlook, emphasizing compassion and worship in an enlarged Buddhist pantheon.
In the same period, India’s ancient trading links with the west were revitalized and greatly extended as the Roman empire rose to power. Ports such as Barbaricum, on the Indus delta, and the entrepot of Barygaza exported turquoise, diamonds, indigo and tortoise - shell, receiving in return a flow of pearls, copper, gold and slaves from the Arab and Mediterranean worlds. Much of the Chinese silk traffic found its way to the city of Taxila, before caravans took it further west. Trade led to other exchanges, as Buddhism spread to central Asia and China.
By the middle of the 2nd century AD the south had also witnessed economic development. The Satavahanas of the Deccan developed a powerful empire and established overland and coastal trading networks and the weaker Tamilspeaking kingdoms of the south established ports on both coasts of the peninsula.

THE GUPTAS
In the 4th century, the native dynasty of the Guptas imposed a new rule, based again in Pataliputra. Following the campaigns of Samudragupta and his son Chandragupta II, their suzerainty was acknowledged over an area almost as great as that of the Mauryan empire. Until repeated Hun incursions ended Gupta power in the 6th century, the Gupta period saw the blossoming of earlier cultural trends, and has become known as the “classical” or “epic” age of Indian history.


2300 TO 50 BC
THE PEOPLES OF NORTHERN
 EUROPE
The late Bronze Age saw a number of developments in northern Europe. The use of metals increased, new crops were cultivated, and burial practices were transformed. The “urnfield culture”, with which these changes are associated, spread over a large part of Europe and laid the foundations for the rise of the Celts, whose warrior bands briefly threatened the Mediterranean world.
Central Europe had rich supplies of copper ores, which for several centuries had been exploited to produce bronze for tools and weapons. After 1300 BC the extent of bronze - working increased dramatically, and new techniques, including the lost - wax method of casting, led to major developments in art. Delicately worked gold ornaments found in some rich graves indicate that there were also improvements in gold - working at the same time. In agriculture, the staples of wheat and barley were supplemented by legumes and oil - rich crops such as linseed. There was also an increase in the domestication of animals, with horses having a greater presence, especially to the east.

THE URNFIELD PERIOD
The most dramatic change, however, was in burial practices, and it is this that has given the urnfield period its name. Inhumation had been the usual practice in earlier centuries, but from 1300 BC there was a move towards cremation and the burial of ashes in large communal cemeteries known as urnfields. Although there were differences from region to region, and even within cemeteries, there was a considerable decrease in the quantity of grave goods buried with the dead. Some burials, such as the so-called King’s Grave at Seddin, were particularly rich, and presumably belonged to local chieftains, but most were simple. A change of practice like this may in part have reflected a change in attitudes to death, but it probably also reflected changes in social organization. Large cemeteries containing graves with little social differentiation suggest the emergence of large communities and more developed social structures.
Another feature that points to social change during this period is the large number of fortified sites. These were centuries in which there was fighting between rival communities, and the archaeological evidence points to a growing warrior culture.

THE CELTIC WORLD
The 8th century BC saw the re - establishment of contact with the centres of civilization in the eastern Mediterranean and beyond as well as with the new Greek and Phoenician colonies in the western Mediterranean and the emerging Etruscans in Italy. At the same time the techniques of iron-working were widely adopted. This development had little impact on the Atlantic coasts of Europe, which were still characterized by small - scale trade between communities with little interest in Mediterranean luxury goods. But to the east the Rhône valley provided a trade - route from the Mediterranean, especially after the foundation of the Greek colony of Massilia (Marseilles). It was this that led to the development of a “prestige goods economy” in Burgundy, seen in the rich finds from Mont Lassois and Vix, which acted as staging posts between the Mediterranean and central Europe, as well as farther east at the hill fort at the Heuneburg on the upper Danube. Contact with the steppe communities on the eastern flank of the Celtic world also continued, and by this route goods from the Far East could reach central Europe. This is well illustrated by the discovery in a burial mound beside the Heuneburg site of textiles embroidered with Chinese silk.
Among the chief exports to the Mediterranean from this period onwards was slaves, which raised the status of warriors who were able to trade prisoners of war for prestige goods from Etruria and Greece. This “West Hallstatt system” collapsed when the Etruscans started to make direct contact with the area around the Marne and Moselle. The same period also saw the emergence of a distinctive decorative aristocratic style known as “Celtic” art. Spectacular finds have been made at sites such as Somme-Bionne and Basse-Yutz.
The Celts are the first peoples of northern Europe to appear in the historical record. They are mentioned by several Greek and Roman historians, and these writings give us some insight into their social organization and their religious practices—although they have to be used with caution. Later Celtic traditions are recorded in the epic literature of Ireland and Wales, but it is not clear how much they can tell us about early Celtic Europe. What is not in question is the Celtic interest—and skill—in warfare.

After 600 BC, Celtic war - bands spread out from central Europe into Italy and Greece—Rome was attacked in 390 BC, Delphi in 279 BC—and settled as far south as Galatia in Anatolia and Galicia in Spain. Other areas, such as western France and Britain, were absorbed into the Celtic world by peaceful means, with the native aristocracies adopting the new continental fashions of art and warfare. From the 3rd century BC fortified urban settlements known as “oppida” became more common, and unified Celtic states began to appear.
Celtic social organization was increasingly influenced by the growing power of Rome, and the Celts were the first peoples of northern Europe to be incorporated within the Roman empire. Already by the end of the 2nd century BC the Mediterranean part of Gaul was a Roman province. Julius Caesar’s conquests in Gaul then brought the western Celtic world under Roman control as far as the English Channel by 50 BC. Thus the most economically advanced areas of the barbarian world were rapidly integrated within the Roman world.

900 BC–AD 700
AFRICA
Written sources from this period increasingly help to reconstruct the history of north Africa, the Nilotic Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia. For the rest of Africa, archaeology remains the primary source and, since research and evidence are currently meagre, for large parts of the continent the past still awaits discovery.
In the last millennium BC, north Africa was inhabited by the ancestors of the modern Berbers. At the coast these people came into contact with a variety of foreigners. The first were the Phoenicians, seafaring merchants who established trading settlements westwards from Tripoli and founded Carthage towards the end of the 9th century. Egypt at this time was politically weak and succumbed to a variety of foreign powers, among them the kingdom of Kush, based at Napata, whose kings ruled as the 25th Dynasty (c. 770–664). From the 3rd century BC, Rome began to assert its power in the region, successfully challenging Carthaginian supremacy in the western Mediterranean. Thereafter Roman control was extended along the north African coast and, in 30 BC, Egypt was conquered. By the time the Roman empire began to weaken in the 4th and early 5th centuries AD, Christianity was widespread in its African provinces and remained unchallenged until the Arab invasions of the 7th century brought Islam to Africa.
By the 4th century BC the Kushite kingdom had moved south to Meroë, where it flourished until the 2nd century AD. Its subsequent decline was probably owed, in part, to the rise of the Aksumite kingdom in northern Ethiopia. In the mid-4th century, Aksum adopted Christianity as its official religion. Although Christian influences must have spread southwards from Egypt into Nubia towards the end of the Meroitic period, it was not until the 6th century that Christianity was introduced into the region. In the following century, the Arab invasion of Egypt began a process of Islamization that spread slowly southwards into Nubia. The rise of Islam was also a factor in the decline of Aksum, which had ceased to exist as a political entity by about AD 700.

IRON-WORKING AND FARMING
Almost certainly it was the Phoenicians who introduced bronze - and iron working to north Africa. In west Africa, iron was being used by the mid - first millennium BC. The development of an urban settlement at Jenne-Jeno from about 250 BC onwards, was probably facilitated by the use of iron tools, which helped agriculturalists to till the heavy clay soils of the inland Niger delta. The earliest evidence of iron use in southern west Africa is associated with the Nok culture, famous for its terracotta sculptures. The early iron-using communities of eastern and southern Africa show such a remarkable degree of homogeneity that they are viewed as a single cultural complex, which first appeared on the western side of Lake Victoria around the mid-1st millennium BC and had spread as far south as Natal by the 3rd century AD. In addition to iron technology, this complex is associated with the beginnings of crop cultivation, livestock herding and settlement. South of Tanzania it is also linked to the manufacture of pottery. In Namibia and Cape Province, which were not settled by these ironusing farmers, some groups had acquired domestic sheep as early as the first two centuries AD. At about the same time a distinctive Cape coastal pottery appears, but others continued with their ancient way of life, living in mobile groups, hunting, gathering and making stone tools.

TO 31 BC
THE EXPANSION OF ROMAN POWER
Rome, a city - state governed by aristocratic families leading an army of peasant soldiers, came to control an empire that stretched from the Atlantic to the Euphrates and from the English Channel to the Sahara. But military success brought social disorder; rivalries between warlords led to civil war; and republican institutions became an autocracy.
The city of Rome grew up on the Tiber at the lowest point the river could be bridged. Although several of Rome’s hills were settled from around 1000 BC, the earliest signs of urbanization date from the 7th century. According to tradition, Rome was ruled by a line of seven kings, and the expulsion of the last of these in 511 BC resulted in the creation of a republic ruled by two annually elected consuls or magistrates. It is probable, however, that the government of the emerging city - state was less formalized than tradition suggests and that republican systems reached their developed form only in the 4th century BC.
Consuls held office for no more than a single year and ruled with the support of the Senate, a council of former magistrates and priests. Legislation proposed by them had also to be ratified by a popular assembly. However, their main task was to protect the city, which in effect meant to lead military campaigns. Success in war brought material gains to the people of Rome and prestige to the commanders making imperialism an inevitable feature of Roman policy.

THE PUNIC WARS
By 264 BC Rome controlled the whole of the Italian peninsula and had emerged as a powerful confederacy and the principal rival to the other major power in the western Mediterranean, Carthage. The Romans were forced to develop naval skills to defeat Carthage in the First Punic War (264–241 BC), in which Rome drove the Carthaginians out of Sicily; soon after Corsica and Sardinia were seized as well. In the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), Rome was invaded from the north, when Hannibal brought his army and elephants from Spain over the Alps into Italy. Though Rome suffered devastating defeats at Lake Trasimene (217 BC) and Cannae (216 BC) it was able to draw on great reserves of Italian manpower to drive Hannibal out of Italy and defeat him at Zama in north Africa (202 BC). With Spain added to Rome’s provinces, the city now commanded the whole of the western and central Mediterranean.

EXPANSION TO THE EAST
In the following 50 years, Roman commanders turned their attention eastwards, leading expeditions into Greece, but withdrawing their troops once victory was assured, in part from fear that Italy, always most vulnerable to attack from the north, would be invaded. Nonetheless, in 146 BC Macedonia was added to the empire, with the province of Asia following in 133 BC.
Among the consequences of Roman victories abroad was an influx of goods and people into Italy. Works of art were taken from Greek temples to adorn private Roman villas, while Greek literature, rhetoric and philosophy had a profound effect on the nature of Roman politics. Wars also provided cheap slaves, who were brought to Italy as agricultural labourers, threatening the livelihoods of Italian peasant farmers and leading to the rapid growth of the urban population of Rome itself.

FROM REPUBLIC TO EMPIRE
The period from 133 BC saw increasing turbulence within Rome and Italy. Rome’s continuing expansion provided opportunities for ambitious men to use their military commands to dominate Roman politics, and the institutions of the republic were powerless to regulate the competition between them. Slave revolts and the Social War with Rome’s Italian allies (91–89 BC) increased disorder within Italy. The last generation of the republic saw the system collapse in a series of civil wars which ended only in 31 BC when Octavian emerged triumphant at the battle of Actium and found himself in a position of such dominance that he was able to rebuild the government of Rome and make it capable of administering an empire.

31 BC TO AD 235
THE HEIGHT OF ROMAN POWER
Augustus, the first emperor, transformed the government of the Roman empire. He brought an end to internal conflicts and created a standing army to guard the empire’s frontiers and extend its power. As Roman culture and organization spread throughout the empire, it laid the foundations for the development of the Mediterranean world.
In 31 BC Octavian, the future emperor Augustus, was undisputed master of Rome. His popularity as adopted son of Julius Caesar and victor over Cleopatra and Mark Antony at the battle of Actium allowed him to rebuild the shattered Roman republic into a system of government capable of controlling a vast empire, reforms which were to bring Rome a new and intense surge of life and two and a half centuries of almost uninterrupted peace and prosperity.
Augustus’s reforms were far-reaching. He restored the prestige of the Senate, though not, in practice, its influence. He reorganized the army and, in 27 BC, took command of those parts of the empire where legions were stationed. From then on responsibility for the defence of the empire lay with the emperor alone. At the same time he took the religiously significant name Augustus, and stressed his relationship to the now deified Julius Caesar. Among his many priesthoods was that of Pontifex Maximus, chief priest, and from the time of Augustus onward the emperor became the focus of all Roman religious ritual.

In 19 BC Augustus was given the power to rule by decree, and although he continued to pay due respect to the Senate, whose members he needed to command the legions and to administer the provinces, his authority was now absolute. The vast wealth he had inherited and won (his defeat of Antony and Cleopatra left Egypt as his personal domain) was further increased by bequests from the rich throughout the empire. At his death his property was worth thousands of times as much as that of even the richest senator. That his heir should also inherit his position as head of the empire was inevitable.
In the event, Augustus had great difficulty in finding an heir, eventually settling on his stepson Tiberius (AD 14–37), who had been a successful military commander but took on the role of emperor with reluctance. Neither he nor his successors were able to maintain good relations with the Senate, and the failure of Nero (54–68) to prevent revolt in the provinces led to his enforced suicide and the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. After a year of civil war, Vespasian (69–79) restored order. He was succeeded by his sons, Titus (79–81) and Domitian (81–96). Though the latter was generally regarded as a cruel and probably insane tyrant, many of his imperial policies were adopted by his successors, especially Trajan (98–117), who began the practice of appearing before the Senate not in a toga but in the purple cloak and armour of a triumphant general. This was to become the uniform of the emperor for the next thousand years.

STABILITY AND STRIFE
Domitian’s assassination was followed by nearly a century of stability as emperors without sons of their own chose their successors from the Senate. Civil war returned in 193, from which Septimius Severus (193–211) emerged victorious. He ruled with his sons Caracalla (198–217) and Geta (209–12), setting a pattern that was to be followed in the following centuries. Caracalla was murdered, and after him came a series of short-lived emperors, of whom Severus Alexander (222–35) was the last who could claim a dynastic link to his predecessors.

THE NATURE OF ROME
The emperor’s figure was central to the empire: everywhere statues and coins were constant reminders of his presence. In the former Hellenistic kingdoms the kings had been the objects of religious worship, a practice which continued with the cult of the emperors. In the western provinces, temples and altars dedicated to the emperor became focuses of Romanization.
The early 2nd century saw important cultural developments: Greek and Latin literature flourished; and the distinction between Italy and the provinces dissolved as rich men from all over the empire were admitted to the Senate, with some, such as Trajan and Hadrian (117–38), even becoming emperor. For the poor there were fewer benefits, and differences in the rights and privileges of rich and poor grew. By the time Caracalla extended Roman citizenship throughout the empire in AD 212, it gave little advantage to the newly enfranchised citizens. Later in the 2nd century, pressures grew on the frontiers. Marcus Aurelius (161–80) spent much of his reign at war with barbarian invaders, and his successors faced threats both from the north, and, after 224, from the rejuvenated Persian empire under the Sasanids.

AD 235 TO 565
FROM ROME TO BYZANTIUM
The 4th century AD saw Roman emperors still ruling an empire that stretched from Spain to Syria. In the 5th century the two halves of the empire experienced different fortunes. Roman administration in the west dissolved in the face of increasing barbarian settlement, but in the east Byzantine civilization, combining Greek and Roman practices and culture, grew and flourished.
The empire emerged from the storms of the 3rd century intact but not unchanged. Diocletian and his successors owed their position to the army, not the Senate, and the military now provided most of the provincial governors. Rome itself ceased to be the centre of empire, as the emperors based themselves in cities nearer the frontiers: Mediolanum (Milan) in Italy; and, after AD 330, Constantinople in the east. The emperors were surrounded by large courts, increasingly turning to eunuchs as their closest advisors. To maintain the army, the taxation system was reformed and military service became a hereditary obligation. But as the senators in Italy and other rich landowners were increasingly excluded from power, so they became less inclined to support the emperor, a development which was to have a profound effect on the western half of the empire.


THE RISE OF CHRISTIANITY
But the greatest change to the empire was religious. In 312 Constantine defeated his rival Maxentius outside Rome, and he came to attribute his victory to the support of the Christian god. In his reign and that of his son Constantius II the churches received many favours from the emperor, and Christianity began to establish itself as the dominant religion of the empire. The last pagan emperor, Julian, died in AD 363 on campaign against the Persians before he had the opportunity to reverse the trend. Bishops such as St Ambrose in Milan (374–97) became increasingly powerful figures in the empire.
Barbarian incursions continued to erode central control of the empire. The arrival of the Huns in eastern Europe in 376 drove many Goths across the Danube, forcing them into Roman territory. Having in 378 defeated the Romans at Adrianople, in 405 they invaded Italy. In the winter of 406 German tribes then crossed the frozen river Rhine in unstoppable masses. The situation deteriorated throughout the century. The Vandals marched through Gaul and Spain before crossing to Africa where they captured Carthage, the chief city, in 439 and set up their own kingdom.
Where in the 4th century the Roman army had made use of barbarian officers, now the western emperors had little choice but to make grants of land for the invaders to settle on and to employ them in the army. With landowners unwilling to allow their tenants to fight, what had been a Roman citizen army became a barbarian mercenary one. Since the frontiers were no longer preventing barbarians from entering the western empire, and since the army was itself largely barbarian, the role of the emperor in the west was effectively redundant.
In 476 the magister militum (the chief military officer of the western empire) Odoacer, a German, deposed the emperor Romulus Augustulus, and did not replace him. With the eastern emperor making no attempt to resist this, the western empire ceased to exist. In 490 the Ostrogoths took control of Italy, and by 507 the Franks had established an extensive kingdom in Gaul (see p. 94). Yet Roman institutions survived: the Roman Senate continued to sit, and Latin remained the language of government.

THE RECONQUESTS OF JUSTINIAN
The eastern part of the empire possessed greater resources than the west, and eastern emperors could use their wealth to persuade would - be invaders to move away westwards. Although Roman culture continued to flourish in the eastern part of the empire, there were growing cultural differences between east and west: when Justinian launched his attempt to reconquer the former western empire, he was trying to impose a Greek - speaking administration on Latin speaking territories.
Justinian’s reign was a mixture of triumph and disaster. In Constantinople it saw the building of the great church of St Sophia (532–63) as well as a devastating plague in 542. His general Belisarius took Africa from the Vandals in 533–4 while in 554, after a campaign lasting 20 years, Ostrogothic rule in Italy was ended. But Justinian’s successes in Italy were short-lived: the Lombard invasion of 568 left only Ravenna in Byzantine hands. Meanwhile in the east there was war with Persia (540–62): Antioch was sacked in 540 and peace was eventually bought only at great financial cost. Justinian’s wars left Byzantium seriously weakened. The dream of a reunited empire died with him.

TO AD 600
THE RISE OF CHRISTIANITY
Christianity began as a small sect within Judaism, but gradually established itself as a significant religious and intellectual force throughout the Roman empire. It offered both a promise of eternal salvation to individuals and, from the 4th century onwards, a powerful new vision of an empire united under a Christian ruler which was to be of enormous significance for the future of Europe.
The earliest Christians did not see themselves as founders of a new religion but as witnesses to the fulfilment of God’s promise to provide his people, the Jews, with a Messiah or redeemer. By raising him from the dead, they believed that God had shown that Jesus of Nazareth was this Messiah and that the risen Jesus had commissioned his disciples to preach the good news of God’s kingdom.

Though the earliest Christians were Jews, they did not interpret the message of Jesus in political or national terms. Christianity was attractive to people besides Jews for its promise of eternal life and for the spiritual benefits of membership of a close-knit, supportive community. So the conversion of gentiles soon began in the cities of the eastern Roman empire and was enthusiastically advocated by Paul, a converted Pharisee and former opponent of Christianity. With the rejection of Christianity’s claims by the majority of Jews, Christianity had become a distinct religion by the end of the 1st century. Christian expansion was much slower in the west: while there was a Christian community in Rome by AD 50, the earliest evidence for Christianity in France and north Africa is to be found from the late 2nd century.

At first Christianity was a religion mainly of the urban poor, but it gradually spread to higher social groups. Its growth went largely unnoticed by the Roman authorities. There were sporadic episodes of persecution, such as those under emperors Nero (AD 64) and Decius (250), but these were aimed more at finding scapegoats for major disasters than at systematically eliminating Christianity. Even the “Great Persecution” of 303–12, under the emperors Diocletian and Galerius, had a more profound effect on the leaders of the churches than it did on their followers, as disputes arose over how they had responded to the arrests and confiscations that occurred then.

By this time the church had grown from a network of small communities, meeting in the homes of richer members, into a well-organized body owning buildings and burial grounds, and led by a ministry of bishops, presbyters and deacons. It was well placed to benefit from the changes that began in 312.

CONSTANTINE
In that year, the emperor Constantine gained a victory in the civil war against his rival Maxentius, which he came to attribute to the power of the Christian God. In the following year, with his fellow emperor Licinius, Constantine declared toleration for all religions in the Roman empire. These events marked a turning point in the history of Christianity, as Constantine came to see himself as a Christian ruler endowed with divine authority, and gave privileges to Christian churches. With these privileges came some loss of autonomy for the bishops, as Constantine attempted through a series of Councils to establish orthodoxy of doctrine on the churches. But Constantine did not make Christianity into the state religion of the empire overnight. This was a gradual process, interrupted by the reign of the pagan emperor Julian (361–3), which was to reach its conclusion—the banning of the pagan rites, which Christians found so offensive—only in the reign of Theodosius (379–95).
In the 5th century there were still many pagans, even at court, but the empire was gradually Christianized through a programme of church building and the demolition of pagan shrines. Monks took a leading role in evangelization from the 4th century onwards. Meanwhile, Christianity had also spread east to Persia and west among the barbarian tribes which were eventually to invade and destroy the western Roman empire.

DOCTRINAL DEVELOPMENT
From its roots in Jewish monotheism, early Christianity underwent a good deal of doctrinal development. Many theologians from the 2nd century onwards attempted to combine the teachings of Christianity with the intellectual assumptions of Greek philosophy. In the 4th and 5th centuries the church embodied its beliefs about God and Jesus in a succession of doctrinal statements intended to prohibit heretical views. The statements of faith in the Trinity and the Incarnation produced by the church councils of Nicaea (325) and Chalcedon (451) were especially important. In them, the early church bequeathed to later Christianity a set of doctrinal assumptions that were not to be seriously challenged until the Reformation in the 16th century and which remain the basis of their faith for many Christians even today.

THE WORLD OF DIVIDED REGIONS
The period around AD 500 saw upheaval throughout the Eurasian world, when nomads from the steppes of Asia descended upon all the existing centres of civilization. Although the gains of the classical period never entirely disappeared, contacts dwindled between China and the West, between north Africa and Italy and between Byzantium and western Europe. For the next few centuries each region was thrown back on its own resources and forced to fend for itself.
In western Europe this period is traditionally known as ‘the Middle Ages’. The description may be appropriate for European history but it makes little sense in the wider perspective of world history. Here, two outstanding events dominated: the rise and expansion of Islam after 632; and the emergence of the Mongol empire in the 13th century. At the same time, important developments transformed hitherto isolated regions. The appearance of the Maya, Aztec and Inca civilizations in America, the creation of the empires of Sri Vijaya and Majapahit in southeast Asia, and the rise of the empires of Ghana, Mali and Songhay in Africa all attested to a new vitality and to the expansion of the area of civilized life.
Europe, by comparison, remained backward. Even here, however, it was a formative age, when primitive societies were welded into feudal monarchies. But the process of consolidation was slow, interrupted by barbarian incursions and by economic setbacks. Not until the second half of the 15th century did Europe begin to draw level with the other world civilizations, laying the foundations for overseas expansion with a series of path-breaking voyages of exploration. Even then, however, it remained overshadowed by the expanding power of the Ottoman Turks for another century.

341 TO 597
GERMANIC SETTLEMENT IN
 WESTERN EUROPE
With the foundation of barbarian kingdoms within the western Roman empire, Europe began to take on the configurations of the medieval period. The Germanic kingdoms were in a real sense the heirs of Rome, and local populations accommodated the barbarian groups, many of whom originally settled among them as Roman allies or “federates”.
The settlement of Germanic and, later, Slav peoples within the former Roman empire was part of a general political and cultural shift within the Mediterranean world in relation to the rest of Europe. Trading and diplomatic relations—both secular and ecclesiastical—between eastern and western Mediterranean and between the Mediterranean and northern Europe were not interrupted.

The origins of the various Germanic tribes are obscured by their own and Roman ethnographers’ legends about them, but long before the Christian era West and East Germanic groups (distinguishable on linguistic grounds) probably migrated from the far north of Europe and east central Europe respectively. Between 370 and 470, the build-up of the Asiatic Huns on the eastern fringes of the Roman empire, despite their pastoral economy and lack of political integration, presented a powerful concentration of force and their attack on the Ostrogoths forced the latter to settle, with Roman permission, south of the Danube in Thrace.
The Huns’ advances appear to have forced other groups into Roman territory, some of whom were recruited to defend the Romans and given the notional status of “federates” or allied peoples. The relationship with the Romans on occasion could turn sour: the Goths, for example, inflicted a major defeat on the Emperor Valens at the battle of Adrianople (378), but it was Romans and Germanic tribes who together defeated Attila and his Huns on the Catalaunian Fields near Troyes in Gaul in 451.

FRANKS AND VISIGOTHS
With the cooperation of the Romans among whom they lived in Spain, Gaul and Italy, the military role of the federate groups became a governing role as well. In northern Gaul Clovis, the Frankish leader, ruled over Gallo-Romans and Franks (settled in Toxandria probably since the 4th century) from 486. The Visigoths, military allies of the empire who had briefly set up their own emperor in Rome itself, founded the kingdom of Toulouse in Gaul in 418. They subsequently expanded their territory in Gaul, but were pushed south into Spain by the Franks at the beginning of the 6th century. The Burgundians founded a kingdom around the city of Worms, but were settled in Savoy in 443. The Sueves founded a kingdom in Galicia, though this was in due course absorbed into the Visigothic kingdom. The Vandals and Alans crossed from Spain into Africa in 429, and in 442 the imperial government recognized their king, Gaiseric, as an independent ruler of the former Roman province.

OSTROGOTHIC ITALY
In 476 the last Roman emperor in the west, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by Odoacer, the commander-in-chief of the Roman army. Odoacer then ruled Italy peacefully until the Ostrogothic leader Theodoric, sent from Constantinople under an arrangement with the Eastern emperor, defeated him and established an Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy in 493. This was effectively destroyed in the middle of the 6th century by the Byzantine emperor Justinian’s wars of reconquest, led by the great general Belisarius. He briefly secured the Vandal kingdom of north Africa and the Ostrogothic kingdom until the Byzantines were ousted by the Arabs and Lombards respectively.

THE EUROPEAN PERIPHERY
Meanwhile in Britain, during the 5th and 6th centuries, Angles and Saxons occupied the eastern and southern coastal areas, from which the Roman garrisons had been withdrawn. The early history of the peoples of southeast Europe is more obscure; but by the end of the 8th century independent Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian kingdoms were taking shape. In all of these centres of settlement and assimilation, a fusion of Greco-Roman institutions, Germanic traditions and the Judaeo-Christian legacy together transformed the Roman world and heralded the emergence of early medieval Europe.

TO AD 600
PRE-ISLAMIC ARABIA
In ancient times the vast Arabian peninsula was largely inhabited by nomadic tribes, which wandered in search of grazing and water for their camels and sheep. Almost all these nomadic tribes spoke Arabic, and they shared certain customs and systems of kinship. Despite these common ties, they had no political unity and no political organization. Ties of kinship were the essential social cement and, in the absence of any system of law enforcement, each tribe was usually hostile to its neighbours.

While most of the peninsula was arid desert, there were towns, villages and quite large settled areas. The most important of these was Yemen, in the southwest corner of the peninsula, where the monsoon winds bring water to a mountainous landscape heavily populated with towns and villages. In antiquity Yemen had supported a thriving urban and mercantile community that prospered from the trade in incense between the area of Suhar, where the frankincense trees grew, and the Mediterranean. Cities such as Marib and Shabwa boasted fine stone-built temples and palaces and a developed language and culture.
By the 6th century, this ancient civilization was in decline. The trade routes were bypassed when the Romans and Byzantines discovered how to use the monsoon winds to bring goods by water up the Red Sea. This decline was symbolized by the collapse of the great dam at Marib, which had irrigated a large inland oasis in about 570. It was never repaired. With the break-up of the old states, Yemen became the target for outside invaders: it was conquered first by the Ethiopians, Christian allies of the Byzantines, and then by the Sasanian Persians.

There were other cities and settlements in Arabia. There were Jewish communities, notably at Yathrib (later called Medina) and Khaybar, and Christian ones at Najran and in the areas bordering the Gulf. There were others, which were pagan shrines. Arabia had a number of ancient holy places where tribesmen who would normally be at war could meet together in the sacred enclave (haram) to arrange treaties and trading arrangements. By the late 6th century, the most important of these was the Ka’aba, the shrine at Mecca, whose guardians were the Quraysh tribe. The Prophet Muhammad was born into this tribe in around 570, and the reputation and skills of the Quraysh were an important ingredient in his success.
The old incense trade had been replaced by other forms of commerce, and the merchants of Mecca sent caravans to Syria, especially to Bostra and the Mediterranean port of Gaza, to Iraq, Yemen and Ethiopia. Incense itself had been replaced by gold and silver, and there is both written and archaeological evidence for the mining of precious metals in the hinterland of Mecca.
Arabia lay on the borders of the two great empires of late antiquity, the Byzantine and the Sasanian Persian. Until the early 7th century, both had supported client Arab rulers, known in Greek as phylarchs: the Ghassanids in Syria and the Lakhmids at Hira in Iraq. Their function was to manage the Arab tribes and keep the borders safe. The collapse of these kingdoms left the way open to nomad advance.

FROM AD 632
THE SPREAD OF ISLAM
In the century after the death of Mohammad, Islam was spread by Arab armies through much of the Middle East, North Africa and Spain. This Muslim world retained a considerable degree of cultural unity. In the Middle Ages it conserved much ancient Greek learning, enabling its later transmission to medieval European civilization.
Islam means “submission to the will of God”. Muslims believe that God’s message to mankind has been expressed through a series of prophets, culminating in Mohammed, the Apostle and Prophet of God; that God has spoken through Mohammed; and that the Koran (meaning “recitation”) is the Word of God. Mohammed is the final Prophet, and no others will come after him.
Mohammed was born in Mecca in about AD 570. The city was the principal commercial centre in western Arabia, and was also an important pilgrimage centre because of its shrine, the Ka’ba. Mohammed received his first revelations in about 610 and his followers soon grew in number. However, the hostility of the merchant aristocracy in Mecca developed into persecution, and Mohammed and his followers withdrew to Medina, some 450km (280 miles) northeast of Mecca. This “migration”, hijra in Arabic, on 16 July 622 marks the beginning of the Islamic era and thus of the Muslim calendar.

THE MUSLIM CONQUESTS
In Medina, Mohammed organized the Muslims into a community, and consolidated his base with the assistance of his Medinan hosts. He returned to Mecca in triumph in 630 and cast out the idols from the Ka’ba, transforming it into the focal point of the new religion of Islam. At Mohammed’s death in 632, his authority extended over the Hejaz and most of central and southern Arabia.

The first of Mohammed’s successors, the caliph Abu Bakr (632–4), completed the conquest of Arabia and entered southern Palestine. Caliph Omar (634–44) advanced to Damascus, and followed victory over the Byzantines at the Yarmuk river in 636 with thrusts east into Mesopotamia and northwest into Asia Minor. By 643 Persia had been overrun, and the last Persian emperor, Yazdigird, was killed in 651 at Merv. The conquest of Herat and Balkh and the fall of Kabul opened the way to India; Sind, in northeast India, fell to the Muslims in 712.

Simultaneously, Arab forces pushed west into Egypt, occupying Alexandria in 643, and advancing across north Africa into Cyrenaica and the Maghreb. Independent Arab forces under the leadership of Tariq ibn Ziyad and Musa crossed the Straits of Gibraltar in 711 and conquered the southern part of Spain (al-Andalus). Raids into southern France, however, were successfully deflected by the Franks. In the east, the Byzantines succeeded in preventing the Arabs from capturing Constantinople and retained control of much of Asia Minor until the 11th century.

Initially, Islam did not particularly encourage, far less insist upon, conversion. The Koran enjoins Muslims to respect the “people of the book”, that is, members of the other monotheistic religions with written scriptures. The peaceful co-existence of substantial Christian (and, until comparatively recently, Jewish) communities throughout the Muslim world is ample evidence that this injunction was heeded. Under the Abbasid dynasty (750–1258), however, large-scale conversion to Islam became common.

POLITICS AND CULTURE
From 661 the vast Muslim Empire was ruled from Damascus by the Umayyad Caliphs. The reign of Abd al-Malik (685–705) saw the development of Arabic coinage, the use of Arabic in the administration and the construction of the first great monument of Islamic architecture, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. Many Muslims were dissatisfied with the regime and looked to the family of the Prophet to provide leadership, forming the Shi’ite sect. In 750 the Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasids, descended from Muhammad’s uncle Abbas. Islam continued to expand as a religious force. This expansion was due to both conquest and, notably in southeast Asia and west Africa, missionary activity by traders and preachers.

600 TO 1500
THE EXPANSION OF CHRISTIANITY
Having begun as a Middle Eastern religion, Christianity became a predominantly European one during the Middle Ages. Christianity gave ideological unity to medieval Europe, especially in the west. But by 1500, divisions within the Church and criticism of its teaching and institutions had paved the way for the religious turmoil of the Reformation.
In the first five centuries of its history, Christianity was largely confined to the Roman empire. The emergent barbarian successor states in the 5th and 6th centuries were also Christian, although some followed the teaching of Arius rather than Catholic doctrine. The Franks, who were pagan, accepted Catholic Christianity between 496 and 508. Nonetheless by AD 600 Christianity had become the dominant religion of the Mediterranean world. However, from the 7th century the Islamic conquests deprived the Christian Byzantine empire of its lands in the Middle East and north Africa: after several centuries of Islamic rule only small Christian minorities remained in these areas. Despite the tolerance extended by Islam to Christians, the rise of Islam isolated the churches of Europe from the Monophysite and Nestorian Christians of the east, who carried out their own missions in Asia in later centuries.

In Europe various independent missionary efforts were made by Irish and Frankish missionaires in the lands of their eastern and northern neighbours. After being converted by Roman missionaries sent by Pope Gregory (590–604) the English were also active in propagating the Christian faith. Differences between Irish missionaries already active in England and Roman missionaries over issues such as the date of Easter were the result of over a century of independent development in the Irish church (since c. 450). Nonetheless these disputes were resolved in the 7th century.

ROME AND CONSTANTINOPLE
The same was not true of the differences between the Roman and Byzantine churches, which grew steadily greater during the early Middle Ages. Though theology played a part, many of the disputes were over liturgical practices (for example, the use in the west of unleavened bread in the Eucharist) or questions of church government and spheres of influence, especially after the conversion of the Slavs of central Europe had been inaugurated by Cyril and Methodius at the end of the 9th century.
The Byzantines were used to a regime in which the Constantinople patriarchs governed the Church under the protection of a Christian emperor, and distrusted the growing power of the western Popes. Although the schism between Rome and Constantinople that occurred in 1054 was not technically a permanent breach, it was an important symbol of the gradual separation of the two Churches. The Orthodox Church in Byzantium eventually came under the authority of an Islamic ruler when Constantinople fell to the Turks in 1453. From then on, Russia, converted to Christianity from 988, was the most important Orthodox Christian power in Europe.

THE POWER OF THE PAPACY
From the 11th century the Papacy assumed a position of leadership in western Europe, which included presiding over the organization of the Crusades (see p. 102). Gregory VII (1073–85) campaigned to end simony (the purchase of ecclesiastical office) and to enforce clerical celibacy. Innocent III (1198–1216) continued his work and was probably the most powerful Pope of the Middle Ages. Papal pretensions to superiority over secular rulers often led to political conflicts. In 1302 Boniface VIII propounded the theory of the “two swords”, which held that both temporal and spiritual leadership in Christendom should be under the control of the papacy.

The wealth and political pretensions of the Church in the west also led to opposition at a popular level. From the 11th century, heretical movements existed in western Europe. The Cathars of southern France revived the ancient gnostic and Manichaean belief that the flesh was evil, but attracted popular support because of their holiness of life and rejection of the power of the Church. Though the Cathars, like other heretics, were brutally suppressed, some churchmen realized that reform of the Church, rather than the violence of the Inquisition, was the answer to heresy. The foundation of orders of friars by Dominic (1172–1221) and Francis of Assisi (1181–1226) was a response to the need of the Church for anti-heretical preachers. The friars played an important role in preaching the gospel in later medieval Europe, as well as leading a few attempts at converting Muslims to Christianity.

In the 14th century there were further challenges to the Church in western Europe. The English scholar John Wyclif (1330–84) led a movement of protest against both its wealth and some of its teachings, and there were similar protests elsewhere. The papal schism of 1378 to 1415, when two rival claimants to the papacy were supported by different secular rulers, did much to encourage calls for reform. Though such proposals came to nothing during the Middle Ages, hostility to the papacy played a large part in the Reformation of the 16th century (see p. 185). Nonetheless, by 1500 Europe was a wholly Christian civilization. Despite protests against the papacy, there is little to suggest that the Catholic Church did not continue to provide adequately for the spiritual needs of most west Europeans.

AD 70 TO 1800
THE JEWISH DIASPORA
After their persecution in Palestine by the Romans in the 1st century AD, Jews settled across much of north Africa and then Europe, contributing decisively to the cultural, intellectual and economic development of their new countries. Further expulsions in the Middle Ages led to a new round of enforced Jewish migrations, above all to Poland and Lithuania.
For over 2000 years the history of the Jews has combined external dispersal with internal cohesion. The decisive dispersal of the Jewish people took place under Rome. Although the Jewish revolts of AD 66–73 and 132–5 and their vigorous suppression by the Romans, as well as Hadrian’s measures to de-Judaize Jerusalem, caused rapid deterioration in the position of the Jews in Judaea, elsewhere in the Roman world their legal and economic status and the viability of their communities remained unaffected. This stimulated a constant flow of migration from Palestine, Mesopotamia and Alexandria to the western and northern shores of the Mediterranean. Consequently, widely scattered but internally cohesive Jewish communities developed all over the west and north of the Roman empire: in Italy, in Spain and as far north as Cologne. The Cairo community was a major element in Mediterranean commerce and has left its detailed records (the Cairo “Genizah”) of life there during the Middle Ages.

MEDIEVAL JEWRY AND THE EXPULSIONS
The resilience of Judaism can be chiefly ascribed to the evolution of the Jewish religion following the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem in 586 BC, and the gradual emergence of a faith based on synagogue and communal prayer. New local leaders of Jewish life, the men of learning, or rabbis, emerged. Jewish religious and civil law was gradually codified in the Mishnah (AD 200) and the commentary and discussions systematized as the Talmud (AD 500).
During the High Middle Ages Jews from the Near East and north Africa settled in southern Italy, Spain, France and southern Germany. They flourished in Spain under the first Umayyad caliph of Córdoba, ‘Abd ar-Rahman III (912–61), and continued to play a major role in society, learning and commerce until 1391. Despite the massacres which attended the First Crusade in the 1090s, the 11th and 12th centuries constituted the golden age of medieval German Jewry.
A series of expulsions from western Europe, beginning in England in 1290, led to a steady eastwards migration of German Jews (Ashkenazim) to Prague (from the 11th century) and Vienna. Jewish communities arose in Cracow, Kalisz, and other towns in western and southern Poland in the 13th century and, further east, at Lvov, Brest-Litovsk and Grodno in the 14th. The period of heaviest immigration from the west into Poland-Lithuania came in the late 15th and 16th. Most of the expelled Spanish and Portuguese Jews (Sephardim) settled in the Ottoman empire and north Africa, though in the late 16th century a trickle migrated to Rome and northern Italy.

THE REVIVAL OF JEWISH LIFE
After the disruption of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), Jews from central and eastern Europe, as well as the Near East, were once again able to settle, usually in ghettos, with the permission of both trading cities and princely governments, in northern Italy, Germany, Holland and, from the 1650s, in England and the English colonies in the New World (first those in the Caribbean and later in North America). Small groups also migrated from Germany to Denmark and Sweden. In the central European cities of Vienna, Berlin, Hamburg and Budapest, Jewish communities grew considerably during the 18th and 19th centuries and made major contributions to the development of their countries, in particular engaging in financial enterprises forbidden to Christians. During the 17th and 18th centuries, some of the largest and wealthiest, as well as culturally most sophisticated, communities in the Jewish world lived in Amsterdam, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Livorno, Venice, Rome, Berlin and London. Amsterdam’s Jews were especially important in the areas of commerce, finance, printing and book production.

EASTERN EUROPE
Nevertheless until the 1940s by far the greater proportion of world Jewry continued to live in eastern Europe. The small Jewish populations in Hungary and Romania in 1700 increased in the 18th and 19th centuries through immigration from Poland and Czech lands. Under the tsars, the bulk of the Jewish population in the Russian empire was confined by law to western areas (the “Pale of Settlement”). The demographic preponderance of eastern Europe in world Jewry ended with the Nazis: Jewish life in Poland, Czechoslovakia and the old Pale of Settlement was largely destroyed though large Jewish populations survived in the USSR, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary.

482 TO 814
THE RISE OF THE FRANKISH KINGDOM
The kingdom of the Franks in Gaul was the most enduring of the barbarian successor states to the Roman empire. Under the Carolingians the Franks dominated western Europe. They combined remarkable political and cultural coherence with crucial developments in kingship and government, culture, education, religion and social organization.
The Merovingian Kingdom of the Franks in Gaul (so called because the kings claimed Meroveus, a sea monster, as their legendary ancestor) proved to be the most enduring of the barbarian successor states to the Roman empire. The conquests of Clovis and his sons and grandsons created a powerful basis for Frankish hegemony and one which was built on by their Carolingian successors who later dominated western Europe. Frankish rule in western Europe was a time of remarkable political and cultural coherence, combined with crucial, diverse and formative developments in almost every sphere of life.

THE MEROVINGIANS
The splendid grave of Clovis’s father, Childeric (d. 481), discovered at Tournai in 1653, shows that, although a pagan, he had ruled as Roman military governor in the north of Gaul. Clovis’s conversion to Catholicism was a major factor in winning over the Gallo-Roman population to acceptance of his rule. Gallo - Romans and Franks merged; by the 7th century it is not possible to determine who among the counts and bishops who were so prominent in Merovingian administration and politics was descended from Gallo-Romans and who from Franks. It is symptomatic of the assimilation of peoples in Gaul that the French language has developed from Latin, though it was not until the 9th century that the first small adjustments to the orthography of the written language began to be made. For the whole of the period of Frankish dominance in Europe, Latin was the language of law, religion and education. West of the Rhine it was the vernacular as well.
Under Clovis’s descendants, Frankish power was largely concentrated north of the Loire and especially in the areas known as Neustria and Austrasia. From 613 the kings increasingly relied on officials known as the “mayors of the palace” and other aristocrats who governed the far flung regions of the realm. It was from Austrasia’s most powerful family, the Arnulfings, later known as the Carolingians, that the most concerted challenge to Merovingian rule emerged. It was led by Pippin II, mayor of the palace, for whom the Battle of Tertry in 687 was a crucial if short-term victory. It was Pippin II’s son Charles Martel, however, who rebuilt the family’s and Frankish fortunes in the face of opposition from the Neustrian mayors of the palace, the Frisians, Aquitainians and Saracens. By the time of his death in 741 Charles, although still nominally only the mayor of the palace, handed on to his sons Pippin and Carloman a greatly enlarged and strengthened realm.
It was Pippin III who in 751, on the advice and with the consent of the Frankish magnates, made himself king and so established the new Carolingian dynasty. Pippin’s position was further strengthened in 754 when the Pope crossed the Alps and anointed him and his sons as the rightful rulers of the Franks. The realm was again expanded under Pippin III to include Alemannia and Aquitania.

CHARLEMAGNE
Pippin’s son Charlemagne conquered the Lombard kingdom and annexed Bavaria. In a series of bloody campaigns he then beat the Saxons into submission and obliged them to accept Christianity. Despite the setback at Roncesvalles (778) immortalized in the Chanson de Roland, Charlemagne established control of the Spanish march. He also achieved a celebrated victory against the Avars (796). Charlemagne’s rule over many peoples was recognized in his coronation as emperor on Christmas Day 800, though this event was largely symbolic and did not materially affect Charlemagne’s status or power: it had more to do with the role of the Frankish king in relation to Italy and his protection of Rome. Later generations, however, were to capitalize on its implications. The arrangements for the succession, devised in 806 but never put into effect, did not in fact preserve the imperial title. However, with the death by 813 of all his sons save one, Louis, Charlemagne crowned him as his successor. The triumphalist narratives of the 9th century created a strong image of Carolingian continuity and success which inspired later rulers in Europe.

CAROLINGIAN GOVERNMENT
The Carolingian conquests were accompanied by the consolidation of the Christian Church. The support as well as the protection of the Papacy, the close relationship with the Church, the clerics’ key role in all aspects of government alongside lay magnates and the status of the Carolingian ruler as Christian king, responsible for the faith and welfare of the Christians under his dominion, are hallmarks of the Carolingian regime. Scholars, poets and artists from all over Europe were gathered at the court, centred on Aachen from the end of the 8th century, and at other cultural centres throughout the realm. Many innovations were made in government, not least the reform of the coinage and of weights and measures, and a restructuring of the administration, relying heavily on written communications, to rule the vast territories effectively. Laws were compiled and officials charged to ensure justice in society. Christian learning and education, church and monastic life were all regulated and supported systematically. Copies of specified liturgical books for use in the churches, as well as of a corrected Bible text and canon law (ecclesiastical law) were prepared by Carolingian scholars under court auspices for dissemination throughout the kingdom. Although many may have come reluctantly under the Frankish yoke, the Carolingian realm knit together a great diversity of peoples in a remarkable way and laid the foundations of modern western Europe.

793 TO 1000
MAGYARS, SARACENS AND VIKINGS IN 9TH AND 10TH CENTURY EUROPE
Three main groups—Magyars, Saracens and Vikings—launched raids on Europe in the 9th and 10th centuries, as well as being involved in trade. It was the Vikings who proved the most adaptable colonists. Settlements established by them in the north Atlantic and North Sea, Russia and the Mediterranean developed into strong independent states.

The relatively effective rule of the Carolingians in western Europe (see p. 95) and of the various kings in Britain gave some assurance of security from attacks both to religious communities and merchants. By the 8th century abbeys and markets were not fortified and the masonry from Roman defences was often used for other building work. The wealth accumulated in such places offered tempting bait to external raiders. They came from countries whose rulers and people were often also partners in trade, the objects of missionary activity and political overtures or attempts at control, and who interacted with the politics of the countries their countrymen raided by entering into political agreements with them or acting as mercenaries. In the 9th and 10th centuries western Europe suffered attacks in particular from bands of Saracens, Magyars and Vikings.
After the Muslim occupation of Sicily, begun in 827 (though conquest was not complete until 902), Saracen pirates, possibly mainly from Crete and the eastern Mediterranean, established temporary bases such as Bari and Taranto on the coast of southern Italy, and later in southern Gaul, from which they were able to attack centres in the western Mediterranean until ousted by Byzantine armies in the late 9th century. Corsica and Sardinia were frequently attacked and many monasteries and towns in central and southern Italy (including Rome itself) were pillaged.

THE MAGYARS
The nomadic Magyars, who may have moved into the Hungarian Plain from the east in the last years of the 9th century, plundered the neighbouring areas: northern Italy, Germany and even France. Their skill as horsemen and their advantages of speed and surprise made opposition difficult. They also acted as mercenaries against the Moravians and the Bulgars. Major defeats were inflicted on east Frankish armies between 899 and 910, but thereafter the German rulers achieved important successes, culminating in the defeat of the Magyars at the Lechfeld in 955. In the east, the threat of Magyar raids was halted by a joint enterprise by the ruler of Kiev and the Byzantine emperor. A Magyar embassy to the German emperor Otto I in 973 marked the beginning of a more settled way of life for the Magyars. Missionary activities thereafter from Regensburg and Passau resulted in Stephen (977–1038), the first Christian king of Hungary, being given the right to set up the Hungarian Church with its own bishoprics.

THE VIKING RAIDS
Frankish expansion into Frisia and Saxony in the 8th century may have prompted defensive aggression on the part of the Danes. Franks and Danes were able to conclude various agreements in the first half of the 9th century, including the conversion to Christianity of a number of leading Danes and the settlement of Viking groups at strategic points to defend outlying regions of the Carolingian empire. However, raids on Lindisfarne in 793 and on the important trading emporium of Dorestad in 834 were the beginning of a grim record of attacks on both France and England until the end of the 9th century. Although the raids were no doubt described in exaggerated terms by survivors, they undoubtedly caused much misery and distress; for example the bishop of Nantes and all his clergy were murdered in 842. Increasingly effective defence (including buying time with tribute payments and the building of new fortifications) against the raids was mounted by the Frankish and English rulers. The practice of ceding the Vikings territory in order to act as a buffer culminated in the granting of the county of Rouen in 911 to Rollo, which with hindsight can be recognized as the foundation of Normandy.
The Vikings were highly adaptable colonists as well as traders and raiders and their shipbuilding and seafaring prowess enabled them to journey far afield. The Danes settled in England as well as France. The Norse ventured to Ireland, Man, Scotland, the Orkneys, the Faroes, Iceland, Greenland and even as far as Newfoundland. The Swedes travelled down the great rivers of Russia and founded the kingdom of the Rus based at Kiev and Novgorod where they formed links with Byzantium.

900 TO 1050
NORTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE
Stable political regimes in some northern and eastern European regions outside the former Roman empire emerged only in the period from 850 to 1050. Their conversion to Christianity created essential bonds with the rest of Latin Christendom, despite political tensions and enmities between them.
Political conditions were not as favourable to political consolidation in northern and eastern Europe as they were further south and west. In England the kings of Wessex were only gradually able to absorb the Scandinavian-controlled Danelaw and most settlers were apparently able to retain their land, giving a partly Scandinavian character to the customs and place-names of the region. The conquest of the Danelaw and an expanding economy paved the way for the unification of “England” and for the religious reforms introduced by Eadgar (959–75). Nonetheless England remained subject to Danish attacks, and these culminated in the reign of the Danish king, Cnut, who ruled Norway and Denmark as well as England and introduced many Danish and “Norman” connections into English politics. Emma of Normandy, descended from Vikings, married first Aethelred “the Unready” and then Cnut. It was her son by Aethelred, Edward the Confessor, who succeeded to the English throne in 1042. Emma symbolizes the international sphere of politics at this time. In the wake of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, links with France, Flanders and the Mediterranean were strengthened still further at the expense of those with the Scandinavian world.

IRELAND, SCOTLAND AND WALES
Ireland at this time was characterized by political fragmentation. The Irish were rarely united and much of the period was punctuated by war between the various Irish and Viking dynasties, notably the northern and southern Uí Néill. Brian Boru became king of Munster in 976 and then made himself king of Ireland. But the Vikings of Ireland, Orkney, the Hebrides and Man together with the Leinstermen defeated Brian in 1014. His successors, concentrating on the possession of Dublin, still attempted to establish their rule over the whole country until defeated by the Norman invasion of the 12th century.
In Scotland, too, Scandinavian control hampered the consolidation of political power. Vikings settled in the western and southern parts of Scotland from the beginning of the 10th century, and different groups of Picts, Scots (originally from Ireland) and Norsemen formed many shifting alliances until a measure of stability and unity was achieved under the Scottish king Malcom II (1005–34). Relations with England fluctuated; there was frequent border warfare, and a firm boundary was fixed only in the 13th century. In Wales a similar process of consolidation took place: the dynasty of Rhodri Mawr established their rule over much of Gwynedd and Dyfed. Ultimately the instability of the conglomeration of Welsh kingdoms made them vulnerable to Norman attack.

SCANDINAVIA
In Scandinavia itself, powerful kingdoms began to emerge out of the disarray of the Viking age. Most notable was the emergence of Denmark under three kings, Gorm, Harald and Sven. By the 10th century Denmark had become a powerful kingdom, and, under Cnut (1014–35), the centre of an Anglo-Scandinavian empire. Much of southern Norway was united under the rule of Harald Finehair after the battle of Hafrsfjord in the 890s, but after his death in the 930s Norway occasionally came under Danish lordship. Sweden, meanwhile, was united only at the end of the 11th century under the kings of Uppland. On the fringes of the Scandinavian world Iceland was, by 930, an independent commonwealth (without a king) while Greenland was colonized by Norwegians from about 985.

EASTERN EUROPE
In eastern Europe, Moravia was attacked in 906 by Magyar invaders, but a new phase of political consolidation began shortly thereafter, probably in response to pressure from the Saxon kings Henry I and Otto I. Although the Slav peoples along the Elbe successfully resisted the Germans in the great Slav revolt of 983, they remained disunited and loosely organized. It was in Poland that a major Slav state arose: Mieszko I (960–92) united the tribes of northern Poland, and his son, Boleslaw Chrobry (992–1025), extended control to the south. Meanwhile the Magyars, led by Duke Geisa (972–97) and his more famous son, King Stephen (997–1038), the first Christian king of Hungary, established their kingdom. Bohemia, caught between Germany and Poland, had also emerged as a political unit by the time of the Premyslid prince Boleslaw I (929–67). The creation of Bohemia, Poland and Hungary—by the Premyslid, Piast and Arpád dynasties respectively—was based on agricultural development, suppression of tribal differences and independent tribal aristocracies, and on the organizing and civilizing influence of the Church. All three dynasties made use of western institutions and connections to strengthen their position, though a notable feature in eastern Europe in the succeeding centuries was the power of the nobility as distinct from that of the monarchs. Nonetheless Bohemia, Poland and Hungary did not lose their identities, although it was only in the 14th century that a restoration of royal power took place there.

1095 TO 1492
CRUSADING IN EUROPE FROM THE 11TH TO THE 15TH CENTURY
A Crusade was a Christian war concerned with the recovery and defence of lost lands. For those taking part it was a means of salvation. Starting with the First Crusade in 1096–9, the crusaders altered the political balance in the eastern Mediterranean for many centuries. Christian holy war also remained a recurrent feature of northern European politics.

Christians had made pilgrimages to the Holy Land since the 2nd century AD. The combination of religious tourism and spiritual inspiration offered by pilgrimage had greatly increased the number of visitors after the conversion of Constantine and the discovery by his mother, Helena, of the supposed True Cross in Jerusalem. Many new churches and monasteries were built in the Holy Land, often on newly identified holy sites of both Old and New Testament events. Jerusalem in particular held pride of place in the imagination and hearts of Christians everywhere, which not even its conquest by Arab forces in the 7th century could overturn. Indeed, access thereafter was far from denied and throughout the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries there are reports from travellers from Britain, France and Italy who prayed at the holy sites. A constant stream of souvenirs and holy relics, furthermore, reached the west and were treated with great reverence in churches across Europe. Allied to the importance of pilgrimage to the Holy Land were the missionary endeavours to convert pagans conducted in western Europe. Between the 6th and 11th centuries this saw the conversion of the English, the Frisians, Saxons, Slavs, Scandinavians, Bulgars and Rus by Irish, Roman, English, Frankish, Saxon and Byzantine missionaries. Within the Christian Church, moreover, there were intense bouts of eradication of heresy. Pilgrimage, the striving to achieve orthodoxy and the conversion of pagans, coupled with the religious piety and devotion of the laity, came together in the crusading movement of the central and later Middle Ages.

The movement was concerned not only with the recovery of the Holy Land from those who were regarded by the Christian Church as “infidels”. There were also crusades against the Albigensian heretics in southern France from 1208, the pagan Slavs in Livonia in the Baltic from the end of the 12th century and the Reconquista of Spain from the Arabs by the Catholic monarchs of northern Spain which became a national liberation movement. Even such European rulers as the Emperor Frederick II of Germany and King Beta of Aragon were the objects of Crusades to defend the Catholic faith and liberty of the Church against their rulers’ alleged depredations.

THE FIRST CRUSADE
The crusading movement was precipitated by a plea from a Byzantine embassy to Pope Urban II in 1095 for help to defend the eastern Church against the Turks who had overrun Asia Minor. In November of that year the Pope preached the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont. The enthusiasm for the call to wage Christian holy war was remarkable. Nobles and knights made considerable sacrifices which affected both themselves and their families in order to go on crusade, for it was a genuinely popular devotional activity. Many sold their patrimonies to raise money for the expeditions, though only a minority actually “took the Cross” and went to fight. Only a few noble families from France joined the First Crusade, though kings, notably Richard I (the Lionheart) of England and Louis IX of France, were involved in later expeditions to the east.

THE CRUSADERS
Crusaders made a public, formal vow to join a military expedition in response to an appeal by the Pope on Christ’s behalf. It was a legal obligation and Crusaders became subject to the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts. In return special privileges were granted to a crusader including the protection of their families’ interests and assets while they were absent, and major spiritual privileges in the form of Indulgences to reduce the time spent in purgatory atoning for sins on earth. Closely associated with the crusading movement were the military orders, such as the Templars and Hospitallers, whose members had made a permanent commitment to wage holy war. Both the Templars and Hospitallers had their headquarters in Jerusalem, but soon acquired extensive properties in the west. The rulers of the Crusader states, frequently starved of manpower, entrusted great strongholds and large stretches of land to the military orders and by the 13th century they formed the backbone of the military strength of the crusading states.

THE LATER CRUSADES
The First Crusade led to the foundation of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem following the Crusaders’ capture of Antioch and Jerusalem in 1098 and 1099 respectively. The focus of subsequent expeditions was the defence, ultimately unsuccessful, of these gains against Muslim attack. The Second Crusade (1146–8) was inspired by the loss of the city of Edessa to al-Din Zengi, the Muslim ruler of Aleppo, while the Third Crusade (1189–91) was launched as a response to the conquest by Saladin of most of the crusader territories in the Levant, including the catastrophic loss of Jerusalem. Although the city was not recovered, the Crusaders reoccupied most of the coastal ports, so ensuring the survival of the Crusader states.

In Spain the Reconquista—or recovery of land—from the Muslims was given impetus by crusading ideals. In contrast to the Crusades to the east this was a local affair, with little help received from outside. Yet in Spain, too, military orders such as Calatrava (from 1158) and Santiago (from 1170) contributed vitally to the war against Islam. In 1212 the armies of Castile, Navarre and Aragon crushed the Muslim army at Las Navas de Tolosa, winning the most important victory of the whole Reconquista. In 1492 Christian armies took Granada, the last remaining Muslim stronghold in Spain.

The crusading movement was seriously compromised in 1204 by the bloodshed of the capture of Constantinople by an army of Latin Christians, who diverged from a planned campaign in Palestine. They dismembered the Byzantine empire and, together with the Genoese and Venetians, set up Latin states around the Aegean. The crusading ideal, however, lived on. Further Crusades targeted Egypt and the Levant. The Crusader states in the east survived until the late 13th century, with the loss of the last stronghold at Acre in 1291. Even then further Crusades were still mounted against the Muslims as late as 1444 (the Crusade of Varna), and the language of crusading was employed to describe the struggle against the Ottoman Turks and Spanish incursions into north Africa in the 16th century. Crusades were launched against heretics, such as the Hussites in Bohemia (1420–31) and by the Teutonic Knights in the Baltic against pagan Prussians from 1309.

610 TO 1453
THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE
The Roman empire in the east continued—as Byzantium—long after the political transformation of the west by the barbarian successor states. Its distinctive, Greek-speaking, Christian and culturally diverse civilization dominated the east Mediterranean, exerting a crucial cultural influence on western Europe despite the steady loss of territory to the Turks.
Although Heraclius (610–41) had ended the struggle with the Sasanid rulers of Persia, for so long Rome’s most formidable rival, before his death the southern and eastern frontiers of the empire came under attack from the forces of Islam. Constantinople withstood two Arab sieges, in 674–8 and again in 717–8. At the same time the Bulgars settled in the Balkans with armed outposts less than 100km (60 miles) from Constantinople itself.

RENEWAL AND RETREAT
Within Byzantium major disruption to society between 726 and 843 was caused by the controversy over the banning of Christian images, known as iconoclasm. Not long after images in churches were restored, a fresh and vigorous Macedonian dynasty of emperors embarked on a new era of expansion. Between 863, when a strong force of Arabs was annihilated at Poson, on the Halys river in Anatolia, and the death of the great warrior-emperor Basil II (976–1025), a series of dramatic victories pushed back the frontiers, often close to where they had been in the heyday of Rome. In the southeast the Arabs at one stage (976) retreated to the very gates of Jerusalem; the Rus were held and routed at Silistra on the Danube (971); and Bulgaria, after long bitter campaigning, became a group of Byzantine provinces. But the new frontiers, exhaustingly won, proved indefensible, especially as the previously invincible Byzantine armed forces now found themselves starved of funds by a civilian administration fearful of a military coup. In 1071, the Byzantine army was heavily defeated by Seljuk Turks at the battle of Manzikert. The Turks then established a permanent occupation of the Anatolian plateau. In the same year, the empire’s last Italian possession fell to the Normans.

THE COMENENI AND THE CRUSADES
Paradoxically, the 11th and 12th centuries proved to be among the most fertile in Byzantine history in artistic and theological terms. Yet for all their genius, the emperors Alexius I (1081–1118), John II (1118–43) and Manuel I (1143–80) ultimately proved unable to recover much of the vast territory that had been lost, though they succeeded by diplomatic means in maintaining a strong balance of the various interests between themselves and their neighbours. The First Crusade (1096–9) had certainly created serious difficulties for the Byzantine rulers while the ferocious assault of the Christian Latin Crusaders in 1204 inflicted great damage on both Constantinople and the empire.

Byzantium’s strength, apart from its religious cohesion, was two-fold: the themes (administrative divisions) with their independent freeholding peasantry, ready both to farm and to defend its land; and an army and a navy often manned by native officers and troops. By the 11th and 12th centuries, mercenaries—themselves often Seljuk, Muslim or Norman—came to form the bulk of the armed forces, and the important civilian posts in the civilian bureaucracy fell more and more under the control of a few rich dynasties. These owed much of their new wealth and power to the pronoia system, under which key state functions, including tax collection, were handed over to large local landowners—originally for their lifetime, but increasingly on a hereditary basis. In religious matters, Rome and Constantinople moved even further apart. There had been tension, if not actual schism, between the Roman and Orthodox Churches since 1054 (see p. 90).

THE LAST CENTURIES
Both Seljuks and Normans resumed full-scale frontier aggression in the 1170s and many Byzantine provinces were lost. The immediate beneficiary of the Fourth Crusade (1204) was the rising power of Venice, whose fleets had carried the Crusaders and who established colonies on the Aegean islands and Crete. A Latin empire was created with many principalities in Thessaly, Athens and Achaia and Greek enclaves at Nicaea and Epirus. The Greeks still constituted a majority within the truncated empire and in 1261, aided by Genoa, a rival of Venice, they drove out the westerners. But the Greek empire was only a shadow of the Byzantium of the past and was unable to prevent the steady advance of the Ottoman empire into Anatolia, Thrace, Macedonia and Bulgaria in the 14th century and the conquest of Constantinople itself by Mehmet the Conqueror in 1453.

882 TO 1242
THE FIRST RUSSIAN STATE: KIEVAN RUSSIA
Russia first emerged under the Vikings (or Rus) in the 9th century. Steppes, forests and rivers determined the course of the history of Kievan Rus. It received Christianity from Byzantium, was attacked by Mongols and split into various principalities. When the Kievan Rus lost their southern steppe territory to nomads they resumed eastward colonization.
The rivers between the Baltic and the Black Sea assumed great importance from the 9th century with the coming of the Vikings or Rus, who established, dominated and exploited trade routes along these rivers and adjoining lands. The polity the Rus established ran north and south across forests and steppes; these barriers ultimately proved too strong for a river-based north-south alignment to survive. The main waterway route established ran from the Gulf of Finland up the river Neva, the river Volkhov and thence by portages to the Dnieper and on across the Black Sea to Byzantium. As Viking control spread south, Novgorod, Smolensk and Kiev (in 882) became headquarters. Kiev grew rapidly from the early 10th century, and strong links developed with Byzantium, its chief trading partner. It was from Byzantium that Christianity was introduced to Kiev during the reign of Vladimir Svyatoslavich (980–1015).

EXPANSION OF KIEVAN RUS
At the time of the Viking incursions the Khazars and the Magyars held the steppes. The Rus succeeded in dominating the lands of the lower Prut, Dniester and Bug, and in controlling the upper Dnieper route to the Black Sea and thence to Byzantium. Grand Prince Svyatoslav (c. 962–72) determined to strengthen and expand Rus power by crushing the relatively peaceful Khazars. But by destroying them, he opened the way to the fierce Pechenegs (Turkic nomads) who dominated the south Russian steppes until displaced by the equally warlike Polovtsy in the 12th century. Vladimir I had some defensive success against the Pechenegs, constructing a steppe-frontier south of Kiev, and the Rus princes held the initiative over the nomads during most of the 11th and first half of the 12th centuries.

The southern Rus lands, relatively secure and prosperous, became the bone of contention between rival branches of Vladimir’s offspring and from the mid- 12th century disputes proliferated. But the resulting multiplication of princely seats opened up outlying areas to Christianity and commerce. Uniquely, Novgorod’s oligarchy was powerful enough to “hire and fire” princes and to organize the collection of tribute in the form of furs from as far north as the Arctic Ocean. However, in the early 13th century, Novgorod increasingly came under the sway of the princes of Vladimir-Suzdal, who were emerging as the dominant Rus princes. On the eve of the Mongol attack of 1237, Vladimir- Suzdal was about to challenge the Volgar Bulgars whose stranglehold on the middle Volga obstructed further Russian expansion eastward. Nizhniy Novgorod was built as a first move in this campaign.

THE MONGOL INVASIONS
The Mongols, led by Khan Batu, attacked the middle and upper Volga regions in 1237–8. They displaced the Polovtsy who fled to Hungary where they settled between the Tisza and the Danube rivers and came to be known as Kuns. That winter, when the protective rivers were frozen, the Mongols overcame the Volga Bulgars and set upon Vladimir-Suzdal, destroying its wealthy towns. Only the approach of spring saved Novgorod, as the invaders dared not be caught by the thaw among its surrounding marshes. In 1239 it was the turn of the southern principalities of the Rus. Kiev itself was sacked in 1240. Novgorod escaped the Mongol fury but was threatened by incessant attacks from Swedes and Germans in the Baltic region. Its prince, Alexander Nevsky, beat the Swedes decisively on the River Neva (1240) and the Teutonic Knights on the ice of Lake Peipus (1242).
The Mongols established the Kipchak Khanate or Golden Horde which came to control the lucrative trade routes between central Asia and the Black Sea. Much of western Rus, however, came under Lithuanian or Polish rule in the 14th century. At first based in Kiev, the metropolitan of the Orthodox Church moved to Moscow in the early 14th century. This lent prestige to the princes of Moscow and contributed to Moscow’s emergence as the predominant Rus polity in the northeast.

962 TO 1250
THE GERMAN EMPIRE AND THE PAPACY
The right to allocate the Imperial title, to consecrate kings and nominate new bishops or the Pope was vital in medieval Europe. Individual German emperors or popes attempted to assert either Imperial or Papal prerogatives. Popes ultimately sought to promote the authority of the bishops, while the Emperors’ priority was to rule their vast territories.
For all their differences, the separate Frankish kingdoms created between 840 and 843 were nonetheless bound together by many cultural, religious and kinship ties, as well as by the retention of the Imperial title in the Carolingian family. In 911, however, the Carolingians were replaced in the East Frankish (German) kingdom first by the Franconian noble Conrad and then by a member of the Saxon Liudolfing family, Henry I (911–36). Henry I’s son, Otto I (936–73), consolidated his position, extended his influence over the German duchies and into Italy and defeated the Magyars. His Imperial coronation in 962 was the symbol of his aspirations and the southern and Italian orientation of his policies.

IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT
Government in the German empire was intensely personal with the king constantly on the move with his court. Only 13th-century Sicily possessed a centralized administrative system. The Ottonians stayed in their royal residences, supplied by the produce of their estates, as well as at royal convents, presided over by female members of the royal house. Bishops, notably those from the reformed monastic houses of Gorze in Lorraine, played a major role in government. The rulers themselves were devoted supporters of the Church and were behind many of the missionary efforts and founding of new bishoprics, where Christianization and political expansion went hand in hand. It was the royal women, many of whom became abbesses, on the other hand, who appear, together with the bishops, to have done most to patronize culture and learning. The Salian and Staufen emperors continued these traditions.

THE PAPACY AND THE EMPIRE
The connection forged between Church reformers and the Papacy inaugurated a long dispute between the Emperors and the popes over who had the authority to appoint bishops or depose kings (the Investiture controversy). The conflict came to a head under Pope Gregory VII (1073–85). Gregory excommunicated and deposed the emperor Henry IV in 1076, forced him to perform public penance at Canossa, and allied with the Emperor’s enemies—the Normans of southern Italy, the recalcitrant German nobility, and a chain of states around the periphery which feared German power. Although Gregory failed in his immediate objectives, the launching of the First Crusade (see p. 102) by Pope Urban II (1088–99) testified to the success of the claims for papal authority. The Investiture dispute was settled in 1122 by the Concordat of Worms when the emperor granted canonical election and the free consecration of bishops.

The political involvement of the Papacy in the struggle for the control of Italy became clear when Pope Alexander III (1154–81) allied with the Lombard League to resist the attempts of Frederick I (1152–90) to restore German Imperial authority in Italy. The issue was settled by a compromise but the Papacy failed to prevent the Hohenstaufen from acquiring the Norman Kingdom of Sicily in 1194.

THE APOGEE OF PAPAL POWER
Only the early death of Frederick’s son, Henry VI (1190–7), and civil war in Germany enabled Pope Innocent III (1198–1216) to achieve the temporary supremacy of the Papacy. He successfully protected Rome and he claimed the right and authority of examining the person elected Emperor. At the same time Innocent compelled the French king to be reconciled with his wife and become his ally. The Pope also forced King John of England to submit to him. He also had some success in dealing with anti-clericalism. The heretics of southern France were viciously suppressed in the Albigensian Crusade (1208), but Innocent also encouraged the evangelism of the new orders of friars, the Franciscans and Dominicans, and sought to remove sources of discontent with the Church by reforming clerical behaviour. However, like Alexander III before him, Pope Innocent IV (1243–54) allied with the Italian cities to resist the Emperor Frederick II, but the Papacy only succeeded in undermining German influence in Italy when Pope Clement IV (1265–8) called in Charles of Anjou, the brother of Louis IX of France, to evict the Germans from Italy. Disputes thereafter with the increasingly centralized French monarchy over taxation of the clergy and royal sovereignty led to open conflict. Pope Boniface VIII (1294–1303) was kidnapped by his French and Italian enemies. In 1305 his successor took up residence in Avignon, under direct French supervision.

1154 TO 1314
MONARCHY IN BRITAIN AND FRANCE
Within a distinctive blend of public office and landholding in medieval Britain and France, great stress was laid on authority, especially that of kings. Contemporaries did not think in terms of borders or national entities so much as of territorial and legal jurisdictions, where varied social bonds and political obligations and rights were interdependent.

Despite the growth of principalities in France and the strength of the earls in England in the 10th and 11th centuries, kingship survived. The king’s position at the apex of the social hierarchy was hallowed by religious and legal sanctions which might bear little relationship to the realities of political power. In the 12th century kings used their position and fortuitous agglomerations of territory to assert their prerogatives. In the hands of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and later of the French Capetians, Roman law became a powerful instrument of royal authority. But the main weapons used by 12th- and 13th-century kings were the king’s rights as “liege lord”; the duty of tenants-in-chief to render service; the theory that all land was held of the king; and all rights of justice were delegations of royal authority, which therefore reverted, or “escheated”, to the crown in case of abuse or treason. Grave misdemeanours (felonies) were reserved to the king’s courts or “pleas of the crown”. Much of this process was piecemeal; but by the middle of the 13th century the great lawyers (Bracton in England, Beaumanoir in France) had created a systematic theory of royal government, which kings such as Edward I of England (1272–1307) and Philip IV of France (1285–1314) proceeded to implement.

THE NORMANS AND ENGLAND
The process was most rapid in the Norman kingdoms of England and Sicily, both of which were acquired by conquest. In England this enabled William the Conqueror (1066–87) to retain and build up the fiscal and jurisdictional prerogatives inherited from his Anglo-Saxon predecessors. Henry II’s coronation as king of England meant that Anjou, Normandy, the Touraine, Aquitaine and Gascony also came under his rule, creating an Angevin “empire” which, at least initially, held together quite successfully.

THE CONSOLIDATION OF FRANCE
In France, on the other hand, Louis VI (1108–37) spent his reign asserting authority over the petty barons of the Ile de France, and it was scarcely before the reign of Philip Augustus (1180–1223) that expansion of the royal demesne began in earnest. The turning point was the conquest of Normandy in 1204 which effectively meant the destruction of the Angevin empire. After 1214 English continental possessions were limited to Gascony while a third of France was now under royal control. Much of Languedoc was subdued in a campaign against the Albigensian heretics (1209–29) and royal authority was extended south of the Loire.
Kings exercised powers of taxation and legislation (often in consultation with parliaments or “estates of the realm”) and controlled the administration of justice. Nowhere was the network of overlapping rights and jursidictions more complex than in France. Indeed, the determination of the French kings to assert their lordship over these lands and over Flanders gave rise to a series of major wars.

THE LIMITS OF ROYAL POWER
Meanwhile the English kings were asserting similar claims in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Henry II’s attempt to conquer Ireland (1171) achieved only a precarious foothold, but in 1284 Edward I subdued Wales. He tried to repeat the process in Scotland in 1296, but met with resistance under Wallace and Bruce, and his son Edward II suffered a crushing defeat at Bannockburn in 1314.
Edward’s failure in Scotland was matched by Philip IV’s failure in Flanders. Defeated by the Flemings at Courtrai (1302), the French king, who had seized Gascony in 1294, was compelled to restore it to the English in 1303. In England Edward I was compelled in 1297 to confirm and extend the concessions wrested by the barons from his grandfather, King John, in 1215. In France the Estates- General met for the first time in 1302. Everywhere, nobles, many of them well versed in the law, were challenging royal jurisdictions and prerogatives.

c. 950 TO 1150
ECONOMIC GROWTH IN EUROPE
As new archaeological evidence reveals, the early Middle Ages was a vital period of economic activity, in which important new developments in the northwest, the opening up of new trade routes, wealth created by new agricultural land and the foundation of trading towns all built on the earlier economic patterns of the Roman empire.
From the 7th century onwards the northwest of Europe grew in importance as a trading area. In the North Sea and the Baltic region, the Scandinavians built on trading networks already established by the Frisians, Franks and English. The extension of Scandinavian activity overseas coincided with the growing demand for goods that could only be obtained from the north; walrus tusks were at that time the main source of ivory in Europe, and furs from the arctic regions of Scandinavia and Russia were greatly prized. There was a growing commerce in coastal markets called wics. The greatest was Dorestad at the mouth of the Rhine, but there were many others, including Quentovic (near Boulogne), Ipswich, London and Hamwic, later to develop into Southampton. Other small trading towns flourished, such as Starya Ladoga in Russia, Birka in Sweden, Wastergarn in Gotland, Kaupang in Norway and Ribe and Haithabu in Denmark.

THE SCANDINAVIAN WORLD
Scandinavians now sought even further afield for fresh supplies of skin, furs and tusks. A 9th-century contemporary account by a Norwegian, Ottar, narrates the voyage he made from his home in northern Norway into the White Sea in search of walrus. Dublin’s fortunes fluctuated politically but her function as the chief of the Scandinavian towns in Ireland (founded in the 9th century) is emphasized by the striking of the first Irish coins there in the 990s. From the late 10th century her economic power and international connections grew apace, and the existence of continuous building and growth up to the 12th century bears witness to her prosperity. The town served as the chief market for the Isle of Man, the Western Isles of Scotland and the Atlantic islands, all of which remained under Scandinavian control throughout the period.

THE OPENING OF NEW REGIONS
By 1000 it is estimated that the population of western Europe may have reached a total of 30 million and 150 years later it may have increased by a further 40 per cent. Most of this was concentrated in France, Germany and England and was probably related to the opening up of new land by clearing forests. It took three main forms: steady encroachment by the peasants of the old villages on the woods which surrounded their fields; the migration of settlers, presumably driven by land-hunger to the uninhabited uplands and mountains, where they carved out scattered fields and enclosures from the forest and scrub; and planned development by lay lords and monasteries, wealthy promoters and speculators who founded villages and towns, at the foot of a castle or outside a monastery gate, with the aim of increasing their income. All three types of clearing are found juxtaposed in all countries, and their history is revealed by field patterns and by place-names—Newport, Neuville, Neustadt, Bourgneuf, Nieuwpoort. In a few regions—the Po valley of northern Italy, Flanders, the country around the Wash in England—marshes were drained and land reclaimed from the sea.

MARKETS AND TRADE
The agricultural surplus further stimulated the foundation and growth of towns, markets and fairs (notably the fairs of Champagne) which initially served a local market but became internationally renowned after 1150. In the Mediterranean, the survival of silks, pottery and other goods indicated a continuation of connections across the Mediterranean and with northern Europe.
In Italy, Pisa, Genoa and Venice extended their overseas trade, assisted by the opportunities offered by the crusading movement in the eastern Mediterranean. North of the Alps, rivers such as the Rhine, Seine, Danube and Rhône, conveyed bulk transport and connected the cloth towns of Flanders and the Rhineland with the south. The western Alpine passes (Mont Cenis, Great St Bernard) were in regular use. The central passes (St Gotthard, Splügen) and the Brenner in the east were developed in the later 12th century. The Rhineland was a major focus of artistic, intellectual and economic life. Cologne, in particular, was at the height of its prosperity, but the cathedral-building throughout the region, as at Mainz and Worms, is a testimony to the wealth which “the great age of clearing” had made available.

TO 1477
IMPERIAL JAPAN AND THE EARLY SHOGUNATES
The early Japanese state achieved stability in the 8th century when the great families clustered around the emperor swapped military power for rank in a Chinese-inspired bureauracy. This ruled for four centuries until, in 1185, its own warrior clients founded the first in a series of shogunates, which were to rule Japan until 1868.
Japan is first mentioned in Chinese records of the 3rd century AD. These state that the archipelago was divided into a series of small kingdoms, a number of them tributary to the Chinese emperor and most acknowledging the spiritual leadership of the Empress Himiko. Over the next three centuries, a line of emperors, possibly Himiko’s descendants, unified most of what is today Japan either by absorbing or destroying other leading families.

THE INFLUENCE OF CHINA
Early Japan was consistently overshadowed by its much larger and more powerful neighbour, China—so much so that Japan consciously tried to model itself on China. Embassies were dispatched, imperial records drafted on the Chinese model and Buddhism introduced. The changes culminated in the Taika revolution of 645, when a new emperor, backed by the powerful Fujiwara family, first tried to mirror the role played by the Chinese emperors. Further impetus to reform came in 668 when T’ang Chinese and Sillan armies unified the Korean peninsula, in the process decisively defeating at Paekmagang River (J. Hakusukinoe) a Japanese fleet sent to help the allied kingdom of Paekche in Korea. Fear of invasion proved a powerful spur to reform.

Early in the following century, Japan accordingly sought to model itself more closely still on the highly centralized Chinese state, continuing the “Taika” process begun in 645. A new Chinese-style capital was established at Nara in 710 and provincial governors and magistrates, all answerable to the emperor, were appointed. At the same time, all rice-growing land was declared the property of the emperor—was in effect nationalized—and then allotted to households on a per capita basis. Farmers paid the government a tax in the form of rice and were obliged to perform military service.

Soon, however, this structure proved unworkable. After smallpox epidemics had slashed the workforce and conscript armies had been mauled by the northern Emishi tribesmen, conscription was abandoned and the tax system simplified. Whereas earlier land had been allocated to farmers by the state only for life, now private individuals owned income-bearing land-rights (shiki), which they could pass on to their descendants. The type of shiki varied with the owner’s status. At the bottom of the hierarchy, a farmer’s shiki gave him some of the crop for tilling the soil. A samurai’s shiki conferred on him a portion of the harvest from the lands he managed. At the top of the scale, an aristocrat’s shiki gave him income in return for defending the legality of the shiki belonging to those below him. Thus the castes were linked by chains of fealty, which were known as kenmon.

These changes radically altered the power structure of the country. Previously the imperial family had been dominated by the Fujiwara family, who provided the emperors’ consorts. Most emperors were children, very much under the influence of their maternal Fujiwara relatives and, moreover, after coming of age the emperor was required to “retire”. However, by the 11th century the imperial family had begun to reassert itself, and the retired emperors had organized themselves as a kenmon. With the other new kenmon emerging, the Fujiwara now faced real competition, and the scope for factionalism grew.

Now government became merely the arena where kenmon heads hammered out their differences. The kenmon were largely autonomous, but, when there was a need for military operations beyond the scope of any one kenmon, kenmon heads would meet and commission as general a Taira or Minamoto, clans who over the generations had acquired a reputation for producing able military commanders. But recurrent factional feuds, culminating in the Genpei Wars (1180–5), allowed one of these generals, Minamoto Yoritomo, to emerge as Japan’s first military leader (shogun).

THE FIRST SHOGUN
Yoritomo based his regime not in the existing capital of Kyoto, but far to the east in Kamakura. There, he gave justice and protection to any samurai who swore him allegiance. After Yoritomo’s death, his two sons were eliminated by his Hôjô in-laws, who then dominated the Kamakura shogunate. Initially, the shogunate deliberately limited its role to defending the interests of its warrior clients within the existing framework of shiki and kenmon, but in the wake of two major crises, its authority grew: in 1221 a bid by the Emperor Go-Toba to re-establish imperial primacy was crushed in the Jōkyū War; and in 1274 and 1281 two Mongol invasions were thwarted.

But the Hôjô family, with no genealogical rights, overreached themselves in their efforts to control ever-larger swathes of the country. The Hōjo’s fall came about in 1333 through an alliance between the Emperor Go-Daigo and Ashikaga Takauji, one of the surviving scions of the Minamoto. Within three years, however, the emperor and Takauji had fallen foul of one another. The emperor was forced to flee with his supporters to the mountain fastness of Yoshino, where he established what came to be known as the “southern” court. In his absence, Takauji replaced him in Kyoto with a puppet “northern” emperor. Civil war sputtered on between the two groups until 1392.

The reunion of the courts began a period of cultural effervescence. An official “tally” trade was opened with Ming China. At the same time, Japan’s pirates grew more audacious, raiding widely on the coasts of Korea and, later, China itself. Nonetheless, the country remained politically highly unstable. Government was possible only when the shogun could impose order on what by now had become a series of powerful regional magnates, or daimyō. After the assassination of the despotic shogun Yoshinori in 1441, feuding between alliances of daimyō led by the Yamana and Hosokawa led to open warfare in 1467, the Ōnin Wars. As Japan fragmented, the daimyō houses, now cut adrift from the state, themselves found it impossible to maintain internal cohesion and one after another they were brought down by their own retainers. It would be more than a century before Japan was unified again.

618 TO 1279
CHINESE CIVILIZATION FROM THE T’ANG TO THE SUNG
Under the T’ang dynasty, China’s military and cultural hegemony in the Far East was firmly entrenched. Its successor dynasty, the Sung, was a less dynamic external power but nonetheless reinforced China’s position as the world’s most sophisticated country until the disruptions of the Mongol invasions in the 13th century.
After centuries of disunion (see p. 65), China had been reunified in 589 by the Sui dynasty (581–618). This collapsed, partly from the burden imposed by public works like the Grand Canal, partly from expensive attempts to conquer Koguryo (northern Korea).
e
The T’ang rose from the widespread rebellions that followed to become a strong centralized empire with an effective administrative system. Underpinning T’ang rule was the Imperial Examination System, which was designed to recruit well-educated citizens to serve the empire. It was to endure until the early 20th century.
After some years of internal consolidation the T’ang began to expand abroad. By the 660s T’ang armies had intervened in India, had occupied the Tarim Basin and Dzungaria and had briefly set up protectorates in Tukharistan, Sogdiana and Ferghana. In the same period Koguryo was finally conquered. By the 660s the Chinese empire reached its greatest extent until the 18th century. Chinese culture and administrative methods were spread alongside its military exploits, establishing a Chinese cultural hegemony in the Far East that would endure long after T’ang power had decayed.

In 755 An Lu-shan, a frontier general, mutinied, severely weakening the T’ang. In the years of turmoil which followed, China withdrew from central Asia and became more inward-looking, in part also as the result of the spread of Islam, which by the 8th century had reached Ferghana and later became dominant in Turkestan. Internally, imperial authority was much reduced. Power passed to the provinces, and many provincial capitals grew into large and wealthy metropolises. At the same time there was a massive movement of population to the Yangtze valley, where new methods of farming developed. Trade boomed, and a network of small market towns grew up.

THE RISE OF THE SUNG
At the end of the 9th century, massive peasant uprisings reduced central authority to a cipher. China split into ten states with an imperial rump controlled by five successive short-lived dynasties. Control was lost of the northeastern area to the Khitan (Liao) who set up an empire in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. In the northwest another powerful kingdom, the Hsi-hsia, was founded by the Tanguts. These areas remained under foreign domination until 1368.

Following a coup d’état at the palace of the last of the “Five Dynasties”, the Later Chou, a new dynasty, the Sung, seized power, led by a skilled military and political operator, determined to reunify China and nullify the threat from the north. The new state that emerged was organized on less uniform lines than the T’ang, and was weaker militarily as well. However, the imperial examinations for the recruiting of officials were further streamlined and a meritocracy of career bureaucrats became established. This, too, was a period of rapid economic growth. Between 750 and 1100 the population nearly doubled, trade reached new levels with the help of paper currency and a great concentration of industries arose around the early Sung capital, K’ai-feng. But the Sung paid a heavy price for its weak military defence along the northern border. In 1126–7 the Tatar Chin conquered north China. The Sung territory was soon reduced to central and southern China, and was only maintained by paying vast ransoms to the Tatars.

Nevertheless, economic growth continued in the south. The population continued to increase rapidly, trade and industry boomed and the new capital, Hang-chou, became indisputably the world’s greatest city. This was also a period of great cultural achievement ranging from the visual arts to literature and philosophy. New heights were reached in science and technology also, most significantly in metallurgy, porcelain manufacture, ship-building and compass-guided navigation. Education became more widespread, aided by the dissemination of block printing. Merchants established complex commercial organizations with credit systems. In the countryside a free market in land emerged. Since the old overland routes to central Asia and the Middle East were no longer in Chinese hands, the Chinese became a major sea power, regularly trading with southeast Asia, south Asia and the Persian Gulf. A powerful navy was also built.

In the 13th century, the pace of change slowed markedly. This was mainly the result of the immense destruction and social disruption caused by the Mongol invasion and conquest of both Tatar and Sung territory. Nonetheless, 13th-century China remained far more populous and wealthy than contemporary Europe.

600 TO 1501
IRAN AND CENTRAL ASIA
The history of Iran was dominated by the interaction between the settled Persian-speaking people of the cities and villages and the repeated invasions of Turkic nomads from the east. The Seljuks in the 11th century, Mongols in the 13th and Timur’s followers in the late 14th, all conquered Iran but were in turn converted to Islam and adopted Iranian styles of government. Despite the political chaos, architecture, literature and painting flourished.

The conquest of Iran by Arab armies between 636 and 650 brought Islamic rule to the lands of the old Persian empire. In medieval times, the area of Iranian culture and civilization extended beyond the borders of modern Iran to include Afghanistan and the central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Until c. 860 the Iranian lands were provinces of the Abbasid Caliphate with its capital in Baghdad. From the end of the 9th century power passed into the hands of local Iranian dynasties, beginning with the Saffarids in Sistan from 867 and the Samanids in Khurasan from 892. These rulers were all Muslim but encouraged the revival of Persian language and culture.

From 1040 Iran was taken over by Ghuzz Turks, originally from the steppes east of the Caspian Sea, led by the Seljuk family. They took Baghdad in 1055 and established an empire which stretched from the Mediterranean to central Asia. The Seljuk period (1055-c. 1200) also saw the building of the first great monuments of Muslim architecture in Iran, including the great Mosque of Isfahan.

MONGOL INVASION
This period of comparative peace and prosperity was brought to an end by the invasion of the Mongols under Chingiz (Genghis) Khan (d.1227) from 1218 onwards. Many of the cities of the ancient Khurasan, such as Merv, Nishapur and Balkh, were devastated and never recovered while cities in the south and west, such as Isfahan and Shiraz, were spared the worst ravages. With the arrival of the Mongol khan Hülegü in 1256 Iran became independent under the rule of his descendants, known as the Il-Khans. They established their centre of power in the uplands of Azerbaijan, around Tabriz and their new capital at Sultaniya. Ghazan Khan (1295–1304) converted to Islam and adopted much of traditional Iranian culture. This was also a period when commercial links with other Mongol successor states along the “Silk Road” flourished and merchants regularly travelled between the Middle East and China.

The collapse of the Il-Khanid empire after 1335 led to another period of political division in Iran. The 1370s saw the growing power of Timur (Tamerlane). Timur was a Turkish tribal leader from the area south of Samarkand. Although a Muslim, he showed himself as brutal and effective a conqueror of Islamic lands as his predecessor, Chingiz Khan. At the same time, he made his capital Samarkand one of the great cities of Iran and patronized vast building projects in the city. By 1400 all of Iran was under his control but in 1405, just as he was making preparations for an invasion of China, he died.

After his death, his empire began to disintegrate, but the 15th century was a period of great cultural achievements in architecture and book-painting. Under Timur’s son Shah Rukh (1405–47), Herat became the capital while his grandson Ulugh Beg (d.1449) built an observatory in Samarkand whose reputation reached western Europe.
The final years of the 15th century saw renewed chaos in western Iran, which opened the way for the rise of the Safavids.

1206 TO 1405
THE MONGOL EMPIRE
The Mongols, pastoral nomads from the depths of Asia, achieved conquests of unrivalled range, from the eastern frontiers of Germany to Korea and from the Arctic Ocean to Turkey and the Persian Gulf, though their invasions of Japan and Java failed. Whole peoples were uprooted and dispersed, permanently changing the ethnic character of many regions.

Through their devastating conquests of the 13th century, the Mongols established the largest ever contiguous land empire. Mongol-speaking tribes had lived for centuries in the general area of present-day Mongolia, but it was to take an extraordinary leader to unite not only the Mongols but all the Turco-Mongol tribes of Eurasia and transform them into a world power. Genghis Khan was born Temüjin in around 1167, the son of a minor Mongol tribal chief. In 1206, after years of personal struggle following the murder of his father, he was proclaimed leader of the united Turco-Mongol tribes. Originating in barren lands, the Mongols themselves were relatively few, but from the outset Genghis recruited members of other Turkic tribes. Using traditional battle tactics that relied on light cavalry, he conducted what were initially raids of pillage and plunder from the steppe into the towns. In 1211 he invaded northern China, subduing the independent Chin empire, and crossing the Great Wall aided by the semi-nomadic Khitans. Genghis Khan then turned his attention westward in campaigns against the Kara Khitai, whose Muslim merchants and administrators would form the backbone of his emerging state. Then, reluctantly, he turned against Khwarizm, the first Muslim state to experience the full fury of the Mongol onslaught after their murder of the Great Khan’s envoys. Proclaiming himself the “Punishment of God”, Genghis Khan unleashed the bloody raids and merciless devastation that have made his name synonymous with barbaric mass slaughter. The trail of blood and massacre led from central Asia through Iran to the Caucasus and north into the plains of Russia. The establishment of the Mongol-led armies throughout Asia and eastern Europe in the first half of the 13th century traumatized the world.

One effect of the Mongol conquests was that trade routes flourished, linking east to west across Asia. Tabriz in northwest Iran became a cosmopolitan centre of trade, culture, and learning. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo came this way in 1271, and after 1300 Italian merchants settled as far away as Zaitun in China. The Great Khan Qubilai opened China to the world and, though his empire was riven by cracks, the Yuan dynasty of China and the Ilkhanate of Persia remained close and became beacons of sophistication, commerce and art.

MONGOL CONQUESTS IN EUROPE
Genghis Khan died in 1227. Unlike those of other steppe emperors, his sons and successors were able to maintain and extend his power and territories. Before his death, he had appointed Ögödei his successor and divided his empire among his four sons. Batu, son of the eldest son, Jochi, was bequeathed the peoples of the west, and it was he who directed the invasion of Europe. The northern Russian principalities fell in a lightning winter campaign in 1237–8; Kiev was razed in 1240; Poland and Hungary were attacked, Cracow was burned and abandoned; and in 1241 a Silisian army was annihilated at Legnica. Mongol troops even reached the coastline of Croatia near Trogir (Trail). The death of the Great Khan Ögödei in December 1241 saved Europe; Batu withdrew eastwards to immerse himself in affairs of state as a Grand Quriltai (council) was convened to decide on the succession.

MONGOLS, ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY
The Mongol conquerors came into contact with three main religions: Buddhism, Islam and Christianity. The Mongol elite was shamanist, although many Turco-Mongols adhered nominally to other faiths. However, they were attracted by the high culture associated with the great religions. Many of their administrators were Muslims, Buddhists and Christians, and the Mongol courts had become truly multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious. The Mongols universally exercised religious tolerance, although many have assumed that they were merely hedging their bets with the Almighty. In 1258 the Islamic capital, Baghdad, was captured and plundered, the caliph slain and massacres perpetrated, but the operation was overseen by Muslim advisors, carried out with the assistance of local Muslim rulers and their soldiers and supported by the caliph’s Muslim subjects, Kurds and Shi’ites. Even though the Mongols had sometimes promoted Nestorian Christianity and Buddhism in Persia, in 1295 the Mongol ruler, Ghazan Khan, tactically declared his state nominally Muslim. In China meanwhile, the Yuan Mongols had endorsed Buddhism, thereby strengthening the position of that faith in the Far East. Despite their religious differences Iran and China remained politically, commercially and culturally intimate during the first half of the 14th century. With the Christian rulers of western Europe, the Mongol rulers of Iran—the Ilkhans—played up their Christian credentials, which included the presence of Christian queens and princesses at the royal court and the support of their staunchly loyal Christian allies, the Armenians. The Ilkhans made overtures to the Pope, hopeful that a Christian alliance against the Mamluk sultans of Egypt in the Holy Land might emerge.

Just as Europe was saved by the death of Ögödei, it has been said that the death of the Great Khan Möngke in 1259 saved the heartlands of Muslim Asia. Möngke had targeted both Sung China and western Asia for conquest. His brother, Hülegü Khan, returned eastward on hearing news of Möngke’s death, leaving only a skeleton military force in Syria—of which the Mamluk sultan took advantage when his army defeated the Mongols at Ain Jalut (1260). The Mongol advance in the west was never seriously renewed, and the myth of their invincibility was dispelled forever. Following the death of Möngke, the empire was plunged into factional wars and the dream of a heavenly mandate for universal rule was forgotten.

THE LAST MONGOL CONQUESTS
The death of Möngke saw the khanates of Chagatai and the Golden Horde break away from the empire and the Ilkhans of Persia achieve independence. In Persia and China the Mongol dynasties lasted under a century, while in Russia the Golden Horde lasted for more than 200 years, and the Crimean khans reigned until the late 18th century. In the second half of the 14th century, until 1405, the world once again trembled under the hooves of a Eurasian conquering army. Tamerlane, who claimed descent from Genghis Khan, had a dramatic and bloody rise to power, but his murderous reign marks the final phase of the Mongol age of conquests; his achievements included a victorious march through Anatolia where he defeated, captured and humiliated the Ottoman sultan, Bayezid.

The Mongol conquests were achieved through a mixture of bold strategy, iron discipline, brilliant propaganda, charismatic leadership and the disorganization and ineptitude of their adversaries. The Mongol empire and its armies were directed by able generals and proficient administrators who eventually began to believe their own propaganda: that they had a mandate from heaven to rule the world. Within a couple of generations the Mongol elite had transformed themselves from rude and coarse nomadic steppe warriors to cultured and sophisticated statesmen commanding the respect and obedience of their cultured subjects. Where once the appearance of their tents and armies stabbed fear and horror into whole cities and provinces, their courts later became magnets for seekers of adventure, glory, culture and wealth from around the world. Genghis Khan terrified the world with his cruel and plundering horsemen, but he gave birth to a legacy of splendour.

550 TO 1206
INDIA: THE EMERGENCE OF TEMPLE KINGDOMS
The integration of early India led to agrarian expansion, the proliferation of rival states and the triumph of Hinduism over its rivals. The political centre of India gradually shifted southward to powerful agrarian empires such as the Rashtrakutas and Cholas. As north India fragmented, it became vulnerable to Turkic incursions from the northwest.
The thousands of inscriptions that have come down to us from medieval India reveal an intricate mosaic of kings, lords and priests superimposed on an agrarian populace. Overall, civilization and its revenue-extracting agents now penetrated into regions previously beyond the reach of the more urbanized polities of ancient India. The great metropolises of earlier times contracted as the countryside became filled with smaller settlements integrated into local trade networks. Temple Hinduism triumphed over Buddhism and provided the political theology of royal courts as well as the religious sentiments of the peasantry.

DYNASTIC STRUGGLES
Politically, this epoch was composed of successive “imperial formations”, hierarchies of dynastic empires in struggle and alliance, vying for paramountcy. After the decline of the power of the Guptas (see p. 69), north India suffered political instability until the Huns were gradually pushed northward from India by local rulers. Not long afterwards, three major dynasties emerged as powerful contenders for imperial paramountcy—the Pushyabhutis of Kanauj, the Chalukyas of Badami and the Pallavas of Kanci. Harsha Pushyabhuti, who hosted the famous Chinese traveller Hsüan-tsang, was defeated in 630 by the Chalukya king Pulakesin II, although the location of this battle is not known. The Chalukyas, who claimed descent from the Satavahana dynasty that had held sway in the south 500 years earlier, gained initial victories against the southern Pallavas, but were later defeated by them and finally faced rebellion by one of their ablest underlords, the Rashtrakutas, who rose to become the chief power in south India for nearly 200 years (c. 750–950). The Rashtrakutas, builders of the famous Kalaisanatha temple at Ellora, were perceived by the Arab traveller Masudi as the most powerful dynasty of India. Their rivals were the Pratiharas to the north and the Palas of eastern India, followers of Mahayana Buddhism and patrons of the Buddhist university at Nalanda.

THE RISE OF THE CHOLAS
By the close of the 10th century these empires had weakened and contracted as the ancient Chola lineage of the south revitalized itself to become the dominant force in a new imperial formation that would last nearly 250 years (c. 950–1200). The Cholas made daring military expeditions to north India, Sri Lanka and southeast Asia, gaining tremendous wealth with which they constructed elaborate imperial temples and patronized Brahmin religious elites. In the Deccan, two families revived the Chalukya dynasty and further north the Pratihara empire fragmented into a number of smaller kingdoms warring amongst themselves, that eventually came to be known as the Rajputs. Perhaps the most powerful of these smaller dynasties were the Paramaras based in Dhar. The political instability of north India made it particularly vulnerable to the militarily superior Turkic armies, which under the leadership of Mahmud of Ghazni conducted looting raids in the 11th century.

From the time of the Pallavas the dynasties of eastern India—particularly the Palas and the Cholas—established trade links and cultural exchanges with the kingdoms of southeast Asia. Several Buddhist kings of southeast Asia patronized Buddhist institutions in eastern India and maintained trading enclaves at coastal cities. After the decline of Rome, trade links with southeast Asia were further strengthened, as peninsular India eventually became an important depot in a trans-regional trade circuit connecting China to the Arab Middle East. Despite these trading links, medieval Indian empires remained primarily agrarian in nature. Their royal families, courtly officials and ritual specialists enjoyed the revenue extracted from vast tracts of land cultivated by the lower orders, who in turn were divided into hierarchies of cultivators, tenants and labourers. The Cholas, for example, relied on the flourishing wet-cultivation of rice in the Kaveri river delta. Political authority was not directly administered but was sustained through relations of tribute and dependence among a hierarchy of lords, giving India an almost feudal complexion.

TEMPLE HINDUISM
Saivism and Vaisnavism, the two main orders of theistic Hinduism, which centred their philosophy and ritual around the exaltation of the gods Shiva and Vishnu respectively, facilitated this chain of medieval lordships. These religions, which had been growing since the time of the Guptas, gained the commitments of most royal courts by the 7th century. Two of the most important early texts of these theistic orders were the Ramayana, a tale of the mythical king Rama of Ayodhya, and the voluminous Mahabharata, recounting the war between two royal families for paramount sovereignty of the earth. The latter contained the Bhagavad-gita, which developed the theology of devotion called “bhakti”. Through theocentric histories called “Puranas”, ancient pedigrees and divine identities were provided for medieval rulers, and images of Hindu gods were housed in royal fashion in hundreds of temples which dotted the countryside, reinforcing the ideology of sovereignty and devotion integral to the authority of kings. Occasionally devotion to god (“bhakti”) could be turned against the chain of secular lordships, but such subversions were limited. Temples became the beneficiaries of royal and lordly largesse, accumulating considerable wealth and emerging as significant landholders by the end of the medieval period. This no doubt explains their attraction for the raiding Turks who laid the foundation of Muslim rule in India.


1206 TO 1526
INDIA: THE DELHI SULTANATE
The Delhi sultanate spread Muslim rule throughout most of south Asia. It created the circumstances in which large numbers of Indians began to convert to Islam. In the mid-14th century the sultanate reached the peak of its power after which India began to divide into many smaller sultanates, making it an easy target for invaders from the northwest.

From the beginning of the 11th century the Turkish Muslim rulers of central Asia and Afghanistan had been expanding their power into north India. First Mahmud of Ghazni (927–1030) invaded India 17 times, bringing the Punjab under his sway. Then, from 1175, having overthrown Mahmud’s successors, Muhammad Ghuri built his power in northwest India. In 1206, Qutbuddin Aibak, a Ghurid general who had risen from slave status, established in his own name the sultanate of Delhi.

Over the following 320 years northern India was ruled from Delhi by five dynasties of Turkish and Afghan extraction: the Slave Kings (1206–90); the Khaljis (1290–1320); the Tughluqs (1320–1414); the Sayyids (1414–51); and the Lodis (1451–1526). For the first century and a half they strove to spread their rule throughout India. In 1311 the army of Alauddin Khalji (1296–1316) reached the sub-continent’s southern tip. Under Muhammad bin Tughluq (1325–51) the sultanate reached its maximum extent, drawing taxes from more than 20 provinces. Greater security was promised, moreover, by the decline of the Mongol threat from the northwest. But controversial decisions by Muhammad to levy higher taxes and to transfer the population of Delhi to a new capital in the Deccan led to the disintegration of the sultanate as it reached its peak. In 1341 Bengal broke away to form a separate sultanate; in 1347 so did the Bahmani rulers of the Deccan. Between 1382 and 1396 Khandesh, Malwa, Jaunpur and Gujerat followed suit. The invasion of Tamerlane in 1398, when Delhi was razed, rendered the sultanate’s power nominal, and allowed the emergence of regional powers. From the mid-15th century the Afghan Lodis managed to stretch Delhi’s sway once more over northern India. Dissensions among them between 1517 and 1526, however, facilitated the final overthrow of the sultanate by Tamerlane’s descendant, Babur.

THE HINDU SOUTH
From the mid-14th to the mid-16th century the south was not disturbed by powers from the north. Here the Bahmani sultanate of the Deccan and its successors faced a strong Hindu polity in the Vijayanagar empire, founded in 1336, which under three dynasties dominated south India until its fall in 1565. It is a mistake, however, to regard this competition as simply one of Muslim versus Hindu. Men of each faith fought on both sides.

INDIA AND ISLAM
One consequence of the Muslim conquest of much of India was that it came to be linked more closely with central and western Asia. Large numbers of scholars, poets and craftsmen, often uprooted by the havoc wrought by the Mongols and their successors, came to seek their fortunes at Indian courts, providing a great stimulus to Indian arts. Persian became the leading language of literature and government. The dome and the arch became major features of Indian architecture.

Another consequence was the conversion of Indians from all levels of society, but particularly from the lower levels, to Islam. This was a largely peaceful development in which Sufi saints played an important role. One third of the world’s Muslims now live in the region.

There was much interaction between Hinduism and Islam, particularly at the mystical level. Teachers emerged who drew from both traditions, for instance Kabir (1440–1518) and Nanak (1469–1539), who founded Sikhism. There was fruitful interaction, too, in literature and architecture, where distinctive traditions developed in the regional kingdoms. Nevertheless, orthodox Muslims continued to find much in Hinduism that offended their belief in the unity of God and His revelation through the Prophet Mohammed.
Hindu culture also saw important achievements. Bhakti devotionalism (love of God) spread from south India to Bengal, leading to a revival of the worship of Vishnu as the Universal God in eastern and northern India. Magnificent temples were built in the rich Hindu civilization of Vijayanagar in the south. Nevertheless, in this period Delhi was established as the political centre of India. It was to remain so until the 19th century.

500 BC TO AD 1511
THE EARLY CIVILIZATIONS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA
Maritime trade routes linked India with southeast Asia from the last few centuries of the pre-Christian era. By the middle of the first millennium AD the influence of Indian Hindu-Buddhist civilization extended throughout the region, but by 1300 Islam was expanding into the island world of Indonesia and the Philippines.
Following earlier trends (see p. 19), from about the 3rd and 4th centuries AD there was an increasing adoption of Hindu and Buddhist cults among the local rulers of southeast Asia. They adopted Sanskrit titles and personal names, constructed numerous religious monuments and commissioned statuary modelled on Indian prototypes. In addition and largely through local initiative, Indian scripts and languages came to be used for political and religious texts. By the 6th century Buddhist images and votive inscriptions in Sanskrit had spread over continental southeast Asia, Sumatra and Java.

EARLY KINGDOMS
By the 6th century AD numerous kingdoms, whose locations are not always easy to identify, seem to have emerged. They were in frequent conflict with one another yet most maintained commercial and political relations with China, which welcomed tribute missions from the south. An ancient port has been found at Oc Eo (3rd-6th centuries AD), and from at least the 7th century Hindu temples were being built in lower Cambodia, notably at Angkor Borei, on the Dieng Plateau in central Java and in the valleys of central Vietnam. Buddhist shrines have been excavated at Beikthano and Sri Ksetra in central Burma (Myanmar) and in Thailand (Siam) at U-Thong, Ku Bua and Nakhon Pathom. The best-studied temple complexes are those of Borobudur and Prambanan in central Java (8th-10th centuries); around Angkor in Cambodia (9th-13th centuries); at Pagan in Burma (11th-13th centuries); and the Cham Shivite temple towers of central Vietnam (7th-13th centuries). All combined Hindu and Buddhist elements to varying degrees.
A centre of Buddhist culture developed from the 7th century at Srivijaya in southeast Sumatra, the capital of the maritime empire of Srivijaya, which for centuries controlled trade passing through the straits of Malacca and Sunda. However, by the 14th century Malacca, on the west coast of Malaya, had replaced Srivijaya as the dominant regional power.

DECLINE OF THE TEMPLE STATES
The Salendra kingdom, centred on the temple complexes at Prambanan, was devastated by volcanic ash falls in the early 10th century, and was replaced by a succession of smaller states and, eventually, the Majapahit empire. On the mainland, Pagan was sacked by Mongol invaders in the late 13th century. The Khmer rulers, under pressure from the Thai kingdom of Sukhothai from the 14th century, abandoned Angkor for the greater security of Phnom Penh.
Sukhothai was itself in decline by the late 14th century and the Thai political centre moved south to Ayutthaya and regional capitals were established at Chieng Mai in the northwest and Luang Prabang on the Mekong river. About this time in Burma new political centres emerged at Ava on the upper Irrawaddy and at Toungoo on the Sittang; Pegu became the capital of a new Mon kingdom in the south.

THE RISE OF VIETNAM
Northern Vietnam had been incorporated into the Chinese empire following the Han invasions of the 2nd century BC (see p. 64) but broke free at the end of the 10th century. Despite Chinese attempts at reconquest, a new Vietnamese kingdom emerged which gradually absorbed the Cham principalities to the south, annexing their last capital of Vijaya in 1471. However, with the advent of the Ming dynasty in China from the late 14th century Vietnam again fell within China’s tributary system.
The political changes of the 14th and 15th centuries were accompanied by significant religious developments and the expansion of the region’s international trade. While Theravada Buddhism spread through the mainland, Islam, which had a foothold at Aceh in northern Sumatra before 1300, expanded through the archipelago as far as Mindanao in the Philippines. Rulers of the north Javanese trading ports and those of Ternate and Tidore converted to Islam, whose advance was only halted by the Portuguese capture of the prosperous Sultanate of Melaka in 1511 (see p. 178) and the Spanish settlement in the Philippines from the 1560s.

800 TO 1100
THE MUSLIM WORLD
The three centuries 800–1100 were a period of great political turmoil in the Islamic world: the united Caliphate of the early Islamic period broke up, and a major divide between the Sunni Seljuk Turks and the Shi’ite Fatimids divided the Muslims into two camps. At the same time, this was a period a great cultural and commercial development, especially in Egypt and Iran. Meanwhile, in Spain and Sicily, Christian invaders were gradually conquering Muslim lands.

By 800 the great Muslim conquests were effectively complete. It was only in Pakistan and parts of central Asia that Muslim rule expanded during these three centuries. From 1050 onwards, much of Turkey was conquered by the Turks and came under Muslim domination for the first time. At the same time, in Sicily and Spain, Muslim territory was being occupied by Christian powers from the north and Islam was in retreat.

In the Dar al-Islam the main change during the three centuries between 800 and 1100 was the break up of the Caliphate and the emergence of successor states. In 800 the whole Muslim world, except for Andalus (Spain and Portugal), was ruled from Baghdad by the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid. His death in 809 was followed by a civil war, which saw the beginning of the disintegration of this unity. In 868 Egypt became independent under the rule of the Tulunids, and in 900 the Samanids established their independent rule in most of eastern Iran. By 945 the once powerful Abbasid Caliphs were no more than figureheads in their palace in Baghdad: real power in Iraq was seized by Daylamite military adventurers from northern Iran.

The political unity of Islam was further fractured in 909 when a rival Caliph from the Fatimid dynasty, who claimed direct descent from the prophet Muhammad through Muhammad’s daughter Fatima, took power in Tunisia. In 969 the Fatimids conquered Egypt and became the leading power in the Muslim world. In 929 the Umayyad ruler of Andalus proclaimed himself Caliph, so there were now three Caliphs in different areas of the Dar al-Islam.

These centuries also saw major economic changes in the region. The rich agricultural system of central and southern Iraq was impoverished by the constant disturbances and civil wars, and much of the agricultural land was abandoned as irrigation canals were neglected or destroyed. At the same time, Egypt enjoyed a period of great prosperity under Fatimid rule: the textile industry boomed and Cairo and Alexandria became the entrepots of trade between the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean basins. Cairo, founded by the Fatimids in 969, came to rival Baghdad as a cultural centre, attracting immigrant scholars from Iraq.

The dominance of the Fatimids was challenged in the 11th century by the arrival of the Sunni Seljuk Turks in Iran after 1040. In 1055 they took Baghdad, proclaiming themselves champions of the Sunni Abbasid Caliphs against the Shi’ite Fatimids. The two great powers came into conflict in Syria and Palestine as each tried to control the eastern seaboard of the Mediterranean. In 1071 the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan defeated the Byzantine army at Manzikert, laying the way open for Turkish penetration of Anatolia.

In the 11th century, Italian merchants began to frequent the ports of Egypt and Syria, buying fine textiles, pepper and spices. Cities such as Alexandria and Tripoli became thriving ports once more. But the Italians were also forerunners of the Crusaders, who took Jerusalem in 1099.

1100 TO 1350
THE MUSLIM WORLD
After 1100 the Muslim countries of the Middle East were subject to attack from the Christian Europeans from the west and the pagan Mongols from the east. In the west, most of Spain was lost to the Christians by 1250, but in the Middle East the Mamluks of Egypt successfully drove the Crusaders from the Levant and resisted the advance of the Mongols.
During the 12th and 13th centuries, the Islamic world was attacked by outsiders from all directions. In some areas, the Muslims were permanently subjugated or expelled but, in others, Muslim forces counter-attacked and repelled or converted the invaders.

THE CRUSADES
On the Iberian peninsula (al-Andalus) the Muslims came under intense pressure. In the east, Zaragoza was taken by the Christians in 1118; in the west they took Lisbon in 1147, and the city immediately became the capital of the emerging kingdom of Portugal. The Christian advance was halted for almost a century by the Almohads, a Berber religio-political movement. From their capital at Marrakesh, the Almohad Caliphs ruled north Africa as far east as Tunis and all of Spain and Portugal, then in Muslim hands. In 1212, however, they were decisively defeated by Alfonso VIII of Castile and his Christian allies. The main cities of Muslim Spain fell rapidly—Corboba and Valencia in 1236, Seville in 1248—and Muslim rule was restricted to the mountainous kingdom of Granada, which survived until 1492.

In the Middle East, the Crusaders occupied the lands at the eastern end of the Mediterranean in a long strip from Antioch in the north to Baza and the Red Sea in the south. They were aided by the Muslim world’s divisions between the Shi’ite Fatimids of Egypt and the Sunni Turks of Syria and Iraq. In 1174, however, Saladin (d.1193) united Egypt and Syria, and in 1187 he defeated the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin. Despite the launch of the Third Crusade (1189–91) and subsequent expeditions, the Christians never recovered the territory they had lost. Only a few coastal ports remained in Crusader hands until the fall of Acre in 1291.

A more serious threat to the Muslim world was posed by the invasion from the east by the pagan Mongols under the leadership of Genghis Khan (d.1227). From 1218 they launched a devastating series of attacks on the cities of Iran, and in 1258 they sacked Baghdad, putting an end to the Abbasid Caliphate. In 1260, a Mongol army was defeated at ‘Ain Jalut by a force of Mamluk soldiers from Egypt. This setback proved to be a turning point. Mongol rule was confined to Iran and Iraq while the Mamluk sultans ruled Egypt and Syria. The Mongol ruler of Iran, Ghazan Khan (1295–1304), converted to Islam, and his dynasty, known as the Il-Khans, ruled until 1335.

The main rivals of the Mongols were the Mamluks of Egypt. These Turkish soldiers, many of them originally slaves, took power in 1260. They built up a formidable military machine, and it was the Mamluks who destroyed the last vestiges of Crusader power in the Levant. They also prevented further attempts by the Mongols to take Syria and Egypt. Under their rule, Cairo replaced Baghdad as the largest city in the Arab Middle East and became the leading intellectual and cultural centre.

1000 TO 1500
THE EMERGENCE OF STATES IN AFRICA
The period from 1000 to 1500 saw the emergence of states over much of Africa, crucially assisted by the need to control and secure trading routes and by the wealth which flowed from them. The spread of trade often went hand in hand with the dissemination of Islam. By 1500, sub-Saharan African states had made their first contacts with European explorers.

The period from 1000 to 1500 saw two principal developments in Africa: the spread of Islam and the emergence of organized states throughout the continent. In many places these were linked. By 1000 the Maghreb (northwest Africa) had been in Islamic hands for over three centuries. Between 1000 and 1500 Islam spread south: up the Nile into the Christian kingdoms of Nubia; along the northern and eastern coasts of the Horn; and across the Sahara into the states of the “Sudanic belt”, stretching from the Senegal to the Nile. Muslim merchants crossed the Sahara with caravans of camels which regularly made the hazardous journey from trading depots on either edge of the desert, such as Sijilmassa, south of the Atlas Mountains, and Walata in Mali. This dangerous trade carried luxury goods (and, in time, firearms) and salt to the black African lands of the south. In exchange, leather-work, slaves and gold went northwards: by 1250 the economies of both the Muslim Middle East and Christian Europe depended to a great extent upon African gold.

THE STATES OF WESTERN AFRICA
Although the beginnings of urbanism in the Sudanic belt can be traced as far back as the last centuries BC, expanding trans-Saharan trade gave an impetus to the growth of states. Two of the earliest of these were Ghana and Mali. Ghana, an essentially African polity, which flourished from the 8th to the 11th centuries, was established north of the Senegal and Niger rivers, far from the modern state which has taken its name. Its successor, Mali, extended from the Atlantic across the great bend of the Niger. In 1324 the Mali king Mansa Musa went on pilgrimage to Mecca, and is said to have taken so much gold with his retinue that he caused inflation in Cairo. The empire of Mali gave way to that of Songhay, centred on the Niger cities of Gao and Timbuktu. East of Mali lay the city states of Hausaland, some of which—Zaria, Kano, Katsina—became extremely prosperous, although they never united to form a single state. Further east was Kanem, founded by desert people to the east of Lake Chad. Their ruling dynasty, the Kanuri kings, retained authority until their final overthrow in the 19th century.

By the late Middle Ages, at a time of crisis in western Europe (see p. 138), the black kingdoms of the western and central Sudan flourished. A number of African kings, among them Mansa Musa and Sunni Ali (of Songhay), enjoyed renown throughout Islam and Christendom for their wealth, brilliance and the artistic achievements of their subjects. Their capitals were large walled cities with many mosques and at least two, Timbuktu and Jenne, had universities that attracted scholars and poets from far and wide. Their power derived from a mixture of military force and diplomatic alliances with local leaders; their prosperity was based on control of rich local resources; their bureaucracies administered taxation and controlled trade, the life-blood of these empires.
To the south of the Sudanic states, Hausa and Malinke merchants traded among the peoples on the edge of the tropical forests, especially in the gold-producing regions. The prosperity this trade brought led, by 1500, to the foundation of many forest states, such as Benin. Around this time, also, the first contacts occurred with Portuguese sailors exploring the seas of the west African coast.

THE STATES OF EAST AND CENTRAL AFRICA
In the east, after the decline of the kingdom of Aksum, the centre of political power in Christian Ethiopia shifted southwards, first under the Kushitic-speaking Zagwe dynasty in the 11th century and then, in the 13th century, under the Amharic-speaking Solomonids who later clashed with the Muslim coastal states of the Horn of Africa, notably Adal.

Along the east coast there arose a string of Muslim city states. Kilwa Kisiwani, with its handsome mosques and palaces, prospered as the entrepôt for the gold of Zimbabwe, brought via Sofala. The arrival of the Portuguese in 1498 marked the beginning of European encroachment in this lucrative system of oceanic trade.
Meanwhile, in the interior of the southern half of the continent, many other African peoples coalesced to form states. These processes are best known in two regions: the upper Lualaba where wealth was accumulated in the form of metal, and south of the Zambezi where, from the 10th century, prosperous cattle-herders gave rise to the polity centred at Great Zimbabwe. Other states, many of them Bantu-speaking, emerged south of the lower Congo river, and in the area between the great lakes of east Africa.

1281 TO 1522
THE RISE OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
Originally a petty principality in western Anatolia, from the late 13th century the Ottoman state was transformed into an astonishingly dynamic imperial and military power. By 1522, it had expanded to embrace the Balkans, the Black Sea and the Middle East and had become a major player in the international power politics of the day.
The retreat of the Mongols from Anatolia into Iran in the 13th century created a vacuum in Anatolia which a series of rival Turcoman states fought to fill. Among them was a small polity based on Sögüt. With the accession in 1281 of Osman, after whom the Ottoman dynasty came to be called, it began a period of rapid expansion. By 1354 it had gained its first foothold in Europe with the acquisition of Gallipoli. By 1361 the Ottomans had taken Edirne (Adrianople), which they made their capital. The decisive defeat of the Serbians and Bosnians at Kosovo in 1389 then established Ottoman supremacy in the Balkans. By 1393, Bulgaria had been absorbed as had most of the remaining independent emirates of Anatolia. Ottoman rule stretched from the Danube to the Euphrates.

DEFEAT AND RECONSTRUCTION
The invasion of Tamerlane from the East saw the Ottomans’ first serious setback. Though his empire broke up with Tamerlane’s death in 1405, his victory at Ankara in 1402 had provided the opportunity for the Balkan states and the Anatolian emirates to escape Ottoman hegemony. But reconstruction of the Ottoman state by Mehmed I (1413–21) and renewed campaigns by his son Murad II (1421–51) again brought most of eastern and central Anatolia and the southern and eastern Balkans under Ottoman control.

The emergence of the Ottoman state as a world power was the work of Mehmed II, Fatih, “The Conqueror” (1451–81), whose conquest of Constantinople in 1453 made possible Ottoman expansion into northern Anatolia and their dominance of the Straits and southern Black Sea. The conquest of Serbia, Herzegovina and much of Bosnia now left Hungary as the major European power facing the Ottomans. Mehmed’s failure to take Belgrade in 1456 established the Danube and lower Sava as the Ottoman boundary with Hungary for over 60 years.

With the final re-absorption of Karaman in 1468 the last of the independent Anatolian emirates disappeared. Farther north, Mehmed established a bridgehead in the Crimea by the capture of Kefe (Caffa) from the Genoese in 1475, bringing the Khanate of the Crimea under Ottoman control.
In Europe, the middle years of Mehmed’s reign saw the ending of Byzantine and Frankish control over the Morea, and the erosion of Venetian and Genoese power in the Aegean and the Black Sea. Mehmed’s death in 1481, which occurred soon after the Turks overwhelmed Otranto in southern Italy, put paid to his ambition to conquer Rome. The struggle for the succession between Bayezid II (1481–1512) and his brother, Jem, was then skilfully manipulated by the West, protecting it from further Ottoman incursions for many years. However, with the conquests of Akkerman and Kilia the land route from Constantinople to the Crimea was secured in 1484, while the Ottoman-Venetian war of 1499–1502 underlined the growing Ottoman naval power.

EXPANSION IN THE MIDDLE EAST
The last years of Bayezid II’s reign, and most of that of his successor Selim I (1512–20), were taken up with conquests in the Middle East. The rise of the Safavids in Iran after 1501 brought to power a state militarily strong and ideologically hostile to the Ottomans. Risings among the Turcoman tribes of eastern Anatolia in the last years of Bayezid II’s reign were a prelude to the war which broke out in the reigns of Selim and Shah Isma’il (1501–24), culminating in the defeat of the Safavids at Çaldiran in 1514. Eastern Anatolia was secured and the threat of religious separatism removed.
Selim’s annexation of the emirate of Dhu’l-Qadr in 1515 brought the Ottomans into direct contact with the Mamluk empire for the first time. Over the next two years Selim swept the Mamluks aside, conquering Aleppo and Damascus in 1516 and taking Cairo in 1517. As well as bringing Syria and Egypt under Ottoman control, his campaign added the holy places of Christendom and Islam to the empire. His successor, Suleiman the Magnificent was to continue Ottoman expansion (see p. 167).

1252 TO 1381
THE CRISIS OF THE 14TH CENTURY IN EUROPE
The 14th century saw dramatic change in Europe and Asia as the Black Death spread westward, reaching the Black Sea in 1346, Sicily in 1347 and most of Europe by 1350. In Europe and the Islamic world between a quarter and a half of the population died of plague. The economy and society of East and West underwent radical transformations as a result.

The intense pressure on the land of a densely packed population combined with a succession of poor harvests to cause the Great Famine in northern Europe of 1315–17. Yet though Europe was to be afflicted with a series of further harvest failures, this was also a period of expanding markets, meeting the needs of increasingly active regional trade in wine, grain, dyestuffs and raw materials. Further new opportunities grew after the Black Death, when labour, previously in surplus, leading to low wages, suddenly became scarce.

BLACK DEATH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS
Signs of crisis were visible before the Black Death. Textile manufacture in Flemish and Italian cities was in decline on the eve of the plague. Banking failures, beginning with the Buonsignori of Siena (1298), culminated in the collapse of the great Florentine banking houses of Bardi and Peruzzi in the 1340s. The plague struck in 1346, and by 1350 had swept through most of Europe. Population levels did not recover until the late 15th century because of the recurrence of plague, which became endemic in Europe, though outbreaks were increasingly localized.

Yet though the effects on the European economy were profound, there were many who benefited from the new economic climate, and this was not necessarily a period of severe depression. Thus English cloth exports expanded greatly, as did Castilian wool exports. Farmland was converted to pasture for sheep in England, Italy and Spain and for cattle in the Netherlands, Spain and northern Germany. New products such as saffron were cultivated in southern Germany, where Nuremberg and Augsburg were front-runners in a new wave of economic expansion, partly based on the mineral resources of the lands to the east.

On the other hand, monopolistic guild restrictions meant that some of the once prosperous cloth towns in northern Europe lost out to more agile competitors in the restructured economy of the late 14th century. Florence, too, lost its pre-eminence in woollen cloth, and attempted to become a major centre of silk production instead; but by now there were several lively competitors. Barcelona found a market for its upper-middle quality cloths, but financial crises and internal power struggles sapped the city’s energy and Valencia took over as the powerhouse of western Mediterranean trade. In the north, the German Hansa became a powerful confederation of trading cities which dominated Baltic and North Sea trade in fish, grain, dairy goods and furs, operating through bases at London, Lynn, Bergen, Bruges and Novgorod; for long it was able to keep competitors such as the Dutch and the English at bay.

PEASANT UNREST AND REVOLT
Economic change brought new wealth to some and undermined the wealth of others, such as landlords who lost their source of cheap labour. Villages were abandoned in areas as far apart as the English Midlands and Russia, as peasants moved—often without permission—to the lands of lords who made less demands on them or which had more fertile soil. Many moved to towns, especially when villages were abandoned to make way for sheep. Yet some peasants were able to accumulate large amounts of land, as relatives died of the plague and left them their possessions. To many it seemed that the world was turned topsy-turvy. Social unrest became strident in town and country, exemplified by the Ciompi rebellion in Florence (1378) or the Peasants’ Revolt in England (1381), particularly among those whose depressed social status did not match their rising economic status. Generally, however, serfdom was a thing of the past in much of western Europe by 1400; in eastern Europe it was, in contrast, reinforced, as landlords such as the Teutonic Knights sought to produce grain for their Hanseatic customers.

The 14th century saw severe readjustment, with the restructuring of economies in the wake of massive depopulation. However, by the end of the century the Hansa was enjoying its Golden Age, the maritime trade routes that linked Italy and Catalonia to England and Flanders (opened around 1277) were flourishing, and Venice and Genoa had secured a strong hold on eastern markets: the Genoese mainly in the Black Sea, from where they brought grain and dried fruits; the Venetians in Egypt and Syria, from where they brought spices and cotton. The Black Death was a dramatic demographic earthquake, with severe aftershocks, yet the European economy was successfully rebuilt on its own shattered remains.

1300 TO 1400
EUROPEAN STATES IN THE 14TH CENTURY
The 14th century was a tumultuous period of state building in which rulers sought to define frontiers and develop centralized bureaucracies. They were challenged by parliaments of nobles, knights and townsmen, seeking concessions in return for taxation. Furthermore, the cost of frontier wars forced rulers back into the arms of their subjects.

War added to the turmoil caused to 14th-century Europe by famine and plague. Italy was particularly affected. The struggle for Sicily after 1282 between the French house of Anjou and Aragonese invaders (the War of the Sicilian Vespers) continued long after its formal ending in 1302 by the Treaty of Caltabellotta. Around 1300 northern Italy remained divided between competing cities, themselves often torn apart by Guelph and Ghibelline factions, the former able to count on the support of Naples or the Papacy. As regional despots gained power over the cities, conflict within their walls died, culminating in the conquest of large areas of Lombardy and Tuscany by Giangaleazzo Visconti, duke of Milan. Few Italian republics stood firm against the trend, though Florence made much capital out of its self-proclaimed dedication to the cause of republican liberty.

The pope himself decamped in 1305 to Avignon in southern France, a more peaceful city than Rome. Papal centralization was visible in the tighter control over Church appointments and taxation, successes that generated bitter criticism from reformers such as Wyclif in Oxford and Hus in Prague. The return of the Papacy to Rome in 1376 led to deep divisions among the cardinals and the outbreak of a schism that lasted nearly 40 years.

The conflict between France and England (see p. 110) for control of France, above all Gascony, erupted again in 1294 and then in 1337 (the Hundred Years’ War). Initial English successes coupled with internal strife gravely weakened France and great princes such as the Valois dukes of Burgundy exploited this royal debility to create powerful statelets of their own.

RULERS AND SUBJECTS
Against this disturbed background, rulers sought to create a sound financial base for themselves. Often this meant, as in Germany and Aragon, negotiating with parliaments that controlled their budget. Conflicts between rulers and their leading subjects led to the deposition of Edward II and Richard II in England (1327, 1399), and of Wenzel in Bohemia (1400). In Germany, the great princely houses vied for the crown, but were more concerned to strengthen their own patrimonies than to stabilize the German monarchy. A web of leagues emerged, of which the Swiss Confederation (from 1291) was the most successful.

In the Mediterranean, the Crown of Aragon consolidated its hold. Sardinia, promised by Pope Boniface VIII to the Aragonese in 1297, was invaded in 1323–4, though it took many decades before Aragonese rule became a reality; Majorca, an autonomous kingdom since 1276, was reconquered in 1343, giving access to prime trade routes; by the end of the century Sicily, too, was under Aragonese rule. Castile, on the other hand, was wracked in mid-century by civil war, and social tensions took a brutal toll on the Jewish communities of Spain during the pogroms of 1391. A new dynasty gained power in Portugal, and began to look across to Africa for expansion. In 1415 the Portuguese captured Ceuta.

SCANDINAVIA AND EASTERN EUROPE
In eastern Europe, the century saw the emergence of large, well-endowed states that escaped many of the economic difficulties afflicting western Europe. Hungary at its peak dominated an area between the Adriatic (acquiring Dalmatia from Venice in 1352) and Poland, though an attempt to gain permanent control of the Polish crown failed. Lithuania had possessions from the Black Sea almost to the Baltic, and the marriage of its newly baptized duke, Jagiello, to the Polish heiress in 1386 extended its territories still further. In Bohemia, religious dissent flourished by 1400 among the Hussites of Prague, a city that hugely benefited from the rule of Emperor Charles IV (d.1378), who endowed it with a great university. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, Margaret of Norway acquired loose control of all three kingdoms by the Union of Kalmar in 1397. Yet they were not permanently united and the supremacy of the aristocracy persisted.
Amid these rivalries, a sense of national identity, generally built more around language than race, was emerging in areas such as Catalonia, Bohemia and England. Frontiers between states were being drawn, some of which lasted into the 20th century.

c. 1300 TO 1535
SOUTH AMERICA ON THE EVE OF EUROPEAN CONQUEST
In 1492 the great diversity of physical environments in South America—which ranged from snow-capped mountains in the Andes, to tropical forest in the east, and desert on the Pacific coast—were home to an equally diverse range of human societies, which encompassed all forms of social organization that had arisen in the course of human history.
Europeans began exploring south from Panama in the late 1520s, but their first contacts with the Incas, who were still extending their empire, did not occur until the early 1530s. The size and sophistication of the Inca empire attracted most Spanish attention, but there were also important chiefdoms in Colombia, Venezuela and Bolivia. Tribal groups dominated most of Amazonia, but even here some societies were becoming larger and more complex. Hunter-gatherers continued to inhabit cold and arid lands to the south.

THE INCAS
The Inca empire was very different from that of the Aztecs, partly because of its Andean location. However, it was similarly an empire of conquest, and its expansion often met fierce resistance. It has been estimated that in Ecuador perhaps 100,000 people were killed in wars resisting the Incas. Once the Incas had established political control they began to set up an administrative structure that aimed to integrate the empire. To this end they built a road system, more than 20,000km (12,500 miles) in length. They also imposed a common language, Quechua, which is still spoken by large numbers of Indians in the Andes today, and a common religion, which involved the worship of the sun god, Inti, of whom the emperor was regarded an earthly manifestation.

The Incas developed many techniques for enhancing agricultural production, including terracing, irrigation to channel snow-melt from the high Andes, and raised or sunken fields. To straddle such diverse environments the Incas developed a means of internal exchange between peoples living in different zones, so that unlike the Aztecs they needed few markets. The Incas also attempted to maximize production, or increase security, by relocating large populations. In the early 16th century, the Inca ruler Huayna Capac was said to have resettled some 14,000 people in Cochabamba, moving them from areas as far apart as Cuzco and what is now northern Chile. The Incas also developed a system of storehousing; the storehouses were useful in times of food shortage, but they were used primarily to support bureaucratic and religious elites.

Although different in character, the Inca empire revealed some of the structural weaknesses of the Aztec. While the tally of human sacrifice was less extravagant, religion still strained resources as a result of the vast households maintained for the cults of dead rulers. The costs this involved may have contributed to divisions among the elite, which developed into the devastating civil war raging at the time of the Spanish conquest. Also, some subject peoples, particularly in outlying regions, found the burden of Inca rule so oppressive that they were willing to collaborate with the invader. However, in general, the Incas succeeded in creating an empire that was integrated to the extent that resistance to Spanish conquest was greater in the Andes than in Mexico, and the last Inca ruler, Tupac Amaru, was not defeated until 1572.

AMAZONIA
In 1492 most Amazonians practised shifting cultivation combined with hunting, fishing and gathering along the banks of the large rivers, notably the Amazon itself. However, there is evidence for the emergence of chiefdoms, notably the Tapajós chiefdom at Santarem, whose domain may have covered 25,000 square km (9,500 square miles). Although they had a warlike reputation, the Tapajós were also engaged in more domestic pursuits, producing many items for trade, and in their religion, which involved the worship of idols stored in sacred structures.

MESOAMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN ON THE EVE OF EUROPEAN CONQUEST
When Europeans arrived in Mesoamerica they often failed to recognize the profound diversity of societies that existed there and the people’s resourcefulness in dealing with their natural environment. Instead they regarded them as technologically backward and as candidates for civilization and conversion to the Catholic faith.

In 1492, when Columbus set sail on his historic voyage, the continent he would open to European conquest was already peopled by highly developed societies. In Mesoamerica the Aztec empire had spread its influence throughout much of Mexico and south into Central America. In northern Mexico many other groups still obtained their food by hunting and gathering, while in Panama and on the island of Haiti chiefdoms had emerged.

THE AZTEC
The origins of the Aztec empire, which dominated the Valley of Mexico at the time of European discovery, are shrouded in myth. It probably began near the beginning of the 14th century with nomads settling among the agrarian states of the Lake Texcoco area. Through military conquest or alliance, their lake-bound city of Tenochtitlán slowly achieved dominance over neighbouring communities. In around 1500, Aztec armies extended the sway of their system of tribute-exaction as far as the Pánuco river in the north and Soconusco province in the south. Borne by trade, their influence reached across the northern deserts into southwest North America, over the Caribbean to the Taino of Haiti (who adopted their ritual ball games with stone courts), and to the east past Xicalango (where the remotest Aztec garrison was stationed) into Yucatán.

The population of Tenochtitlán probably exceeded 150,000—much greater than any European city at the time. To help meet the needs of such large numbers, the Aztecs developed an elaborate system of drained fields called chinampas on which they grew maize and beans, and exploited fish and waterfowl. However, although agriculture was highly productive, the city could not be supported entirely locally, so huge quantities of food, clothing and ritual goods had to be levied and transported from far afield. A surviving tribute-roll (which may itself be incomplete) lists over 225,000 bushels of maize and 123,400 cotton mantles, with corresponding quantities of beans, herbs, such as sage and purslane, as well as chillies, cacao, lime, salt, incense and other precious exotica due every year. Other Aztec cities had comparable rates of consumption. The daily market of Tlatelolco, Tenochtitlán’s neighbour, was said to be regularly patronized by 50,000 people.

The Aztec empire was prodigious in other fields. Its material culture featured monumental stone building, vital sculpture, sumptuous goldwork and extravagant featherwork, all requiring intensive labour and expensive raw materials. Its religion exacted a fearful toll in human sacrifices. According to the varying estimates of European colonial sources, between 10,000 and 80,000 sacrifices were offered at the dedication of the main temple of Tenochtitlán in 1487, most of them acquired through capture in war or ritual exchange of victims with other communities. Human sacrifices were required to give strength to the warrior god, Huitzilopochtli, the empire’s patron. The vorp acious appetites of the Aztec system, while forcing its beneficiaries to be skilled in war, also made it vulnerable to a concerted withdrawal of tribute by suppliers. Isolated by the diplomacy of the Spanish invaders after 1519, the Aztec capital was starved into surrender.

THE MAYA
Following the decline of the Toltec-Maya, a new Maya-dominated state emerged at Mayapán in northern Yucatán. There its Cocom rulers kept the lords of tributary provinces as virtual prisoners to ensure the payment of tribute, but in 1441 they rebelled and destroyed the city. Subsequently the lowland Maya dissolved into 16 rival states, whose merchants managed a coastal trade in salt, cotton, cloth, cacao, honey, jade, feathers, obsidian and copper.

OUTSIDE THE MESOAMERICAN HEARTLAND
Hunters and gatherers continued to dominate the vast dry lands of northern Mexico, but further south changes were occurring. Mesoamerican influences spread into Central America through trade and through the migration of the Central Mexican peoples called the Pipil and Nicarao. In 1492 much of Central America was inhabited by militaristic chiefdoms. In Nicaragua the population was supported by the rich volcanic soils found on the Pacific coast. To the east and south the main cultural influences were from South America rather than Mesoamerica. Here many tribal societies continued to practise shifting cultivation, but militaristic chiefdoms, such as the Guaymí and Cuna, had emerged in southern Costa Rica and Panama. They were renowned for their manufacture of pottery, jade, copper and gold, the abundance of which led the Spanish to give these regions names such as “rich land” (Costa Rica).

THE CARIBBEAN
At the time of Spanish conquest the Taino were also organized into a complex series of chiefdoms that might encompass as many as 100 villages and tens of thousands of people. Stone-lined ball courts and ceremonial plazas were constructed, and there was a flourishing of art styles in pottery, woodcarving and stonework. Meanwhile the Lesser Antilles had been occupied by Island Caribs who had migrated there, probably from the Guianas.

1450 TO c. 1600
THE RENAISSANCE AND EARLY MODERN STATE IN EUROPE
Increasing knowledge of the classical past and a desire to return to the Greek and Roman roots of European civilization stimulated the movement known as the Renaissance, which, beginning in Italy, spread rapidly around Europe after the invention of printing. This awakening of interest in its classical past was to affect Europe’s politics profoundly.

The Renaissance saw a flowering of literature and the arts across Europe. Writers and artists, seeking to emulate the cultures of Greece and Rome, developed new techniques and formulated new ideas in their attempts to apply the knowledge of the Ancients to the very different world of the 16th century. Important scientific and technological advances were made. At the same time, increased exploitation of the invention of printing promoted the emergence of literate secular elites and created a new political environment as secular rulers used artists to display their power visually and written propaganda to appeal directly to their most important subjects.

STATE CONSOLIDATION
Such incipient secularization of political life enabled monarchs to challenge the power of the Church: in concordats with the Holy Roman Emperor (1448), France (1516) and Spain (1523), the Papacy was forced to concede far-reaching rights over the national churches, while in a number of Protestant countries the ruler openly assumed control of spiritual affairs.

These changes aided the internal consolidation of states across Europe after 1450, now recovering from the economic and demographic ravages of the 14th century (see p. 138), when so many apparently powerful states had proved ephemeral. The strengthening of the principle of male primogeniture, under which only the eldest son inherited his father’s property, thus keeping estates intact, ensured that states could be consolidated more effectively as well as stimulating desires to recover lost territories. Such “reunifications” brought conflict across Europe, since there were inevitably rival claims to be considered and rulers now enjoyed an enhanced capacity to wage war. This was in part the result of increasing economic prosperity and demographic recovery after 1450. By increasing the tax base of all European states, rulers gained greater access to credit, which enabled them to afford the new military technologies made possible by the development of gunpowder. Large artillery trains destroyed the castles of over-mighty subjects, most of whom were usually in no position to compete financially, while only states could afford the new large, infantry-based armies and elaborate fortifications.

The result was a series of large-scale dynastic and territorial wars. In the east, Muscovy, the Ottoman empire and Poland-Lithuania struggled for control; in the west, Burgundy, the rising star of the 15th century, was partitioned after Charles the Bold was killed in 1477, while in 1453 the English were expelled from France (except Calais). In Spain, Castile and Aragon were united in 1479 and in 1492 consolidated their rule of Spain when their combined forces completed the conquest of the Muslim kingdom of Granada. In England, though defeat by France in the Hundred Years’ War had provoked civil war (“the Wars of the Roses”), after 1485 the new Tudor dynasty restored order and extended royal control in the turbulent north and west. In Germany, a series of dynastic alliances united the Habsburg lands with those of Luxembourg and Burgundy (in 1477). All these possessions, and later those of the Spanish crown, came to Emperor Charles V (1519–56), making him the greatest Christian ruler since Charlemagne.

THE MODERN STATE
Yet royal dynasticism did not triumph unchecked. Growing interest in the classical past sparked debate about the nature of legitimate authority. Where monarchs sought to justify their claims to absolute power by reference to Roman law and the Roman empire, their opponents sought counter-arguments from the classical past, citing Rome’s republican traditions and arguing for a balanced constitution. While most Italian city-republics succumbed to princely power, the republican tradition triumphed to a greater or lesser degree in the northern Netherlands, Poland-Lithuania and in parts of the Holy Roman Empire. This clash of values stimulated the gradual emergence of recognizably modern secular states, in which politics were divorced from religion and organized around an impersonal, centralized and unifying system of government, whether monarchical or republican.

THE WORLD OF THE EMERGING WEST
The Indian historian K. M. Panikkar described the period from 1498 to 1947, from Vasco da Gama’s discovery of the sea route to India to Indian independence, as the European age in history. Others have pointed out the element of exaggeration in this definition: if, in 1750, the Europeans had abandoned their isolated settlements on the coasts of Asia and Africa, they would have left few traces. Nevertheless, around 1500 the balance, which hitherto had weighed on the side of Asia, began to change, and after 1750 that change was momentous.

Before 1500 civilization had been essentially land-centred, and contacts by sea relatively unimportant. If the year 1500 marks a new period in world history it is because thereafter direct sea contact linked the continents. This resulted not only in the integration in a global system of regions which hitherto had developed in isolation, but in a challenge to the age-old, land-centred balance between the Eurasian civilizations.

Nonetheless, the impact of European expansion should not be exaggerated. The 16th century saw a remarkable resurgence of Muslim power in the Ottoman empire, Safavid Persia and Mughal India. China, meanwhile, remained the world’s most advanced state. Indeed to many in 18th-century Europe, Turkey and China were the exemplars of civilized living. The industrial revolution put Europe ahead; but the fruits of that process—some of them poisonous—were only garnered in the 19th century. Europe between 1500 and 1815, for all its thrusting novelty, was still an agricultural society of lords and peasants, closer to its agrarian past than to its industrial future.

c. 1500
THE WORLD ON THE EVE OF EUROPEAN EXPANSION
The central feature of world history between 1500 and 1815 was the expansion of Europe and the gradual spread of European civilization throughout the globe. Until 1500 the world had, on the whole, pressed in on Europe. After 1500, Europe increasingly pressed out on the world. By 1775 a new global balance was in existence.
In the early 16th century, Europe—introspective, uncertain and technologically immature—still stood on the periphery of the civilized world, overshadowed by the Ming empire in China, the most powerful and advanced state of the period, and by the rising Ottoman and Safavid empires of the Middle East. Both in wealth and population, China, with more than 100 million people (more than the whole of Europe), loomed far ahead. Islam, meanwhile, was still actively making converts in central and southeast Asia and among the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa.


The area occupied by the major civilizations, roughly equivalent to the area under plough cultivation, was still relatively small in 1500. Over three-quarters of the world’s surface was inhabited either by food gatherers or herdsmen—as in Australia and most of Siberia, North America and Africa—or by hand cultivators, especially in southeast Asia, parts of Africa and central and South America. But the plough cultivators were more productive and it is probable that between two-thirds and three-quarters of the world’s population was concentrated in the relatively small area which was being farmed by the plough.

This concentration of people and wealth closely matches the location of the major Eurasian civilizations. The comparative fragility of the Aztec and Inca civilizations in the Americas and of the African kingdoms immediately south of the Sahara, all of them highly developed in many respects, may be partly explained first by their geographic isolation and lack of external stimulus and second by their dependence on hand cultivation. After 1500, when the expansion of Europe brought all continents into direct contact with each other for the first time, these non-Eurasian civilizations sometimes found themselves unable to put up more than feeble resistance to outside aggression.

THE TEMPO OF CHANGE
It is nevertheless important not to exaggerate the tempo of change. Although in America the Aztec and Inca empires were destroyed by 1521 and 1535 respectively, elsewhere the political impact of Europe was extremely limited before the second half of the 18th century. China and Japan remained intact, and in India the Europeans were kept at arm’s length for 250 years following the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1498. There, as in west Africa and southeast Asia, the European presence was largely confined to isolated coastal trading stations. The cultural influence of Europe was even more negligible: Christianity, for example, made little headway except where it was imposed by force in the Philippines and the Americas until it was backed by the resources of western industrial technology in the mid- to late 19th century.

THE GLOBAL IMPACT
On the other hand, the European discoveries opened the way to a global redistribution of resources: migrations of peoples, diffusions of animals and plants, release of mineral wealth, expansion of cultivation and re-alignment of trade. The spread of food plants—almost all domesticated by prehistoric man in various parts of the world—had proceeded slowly until 1500. Thereafter, they became common to every continent. In addition, the American Indians pioneered two major cash crops: tobacco and cotton (derived largely in its commercial form from varieties they had domesticated, though other species were known and used in the Orient before 1500). Cane sugar, introduced by Europeans into Brazil and the West Indies from the late 16th century, also quickly became a staple of foreign trade.

This interchange of plants produced an enormous surge in food supplies, which made possible the unprecedented population growth after 1500. It also initiated a corresponding increase in intercontinental trade. Before 1500, this trade was limited to Eurasia and Africa and involved mostly luxury goods. After 1500, the combination of regional economic specialization and improved sea transport made possible the gradual transformation of the limited medieval luxury trade into the modern mass trade of new bulky necessities—hence the flourishing “triangular trade” of rum, cloths, guns and other metal products from Europe to Africa, slaves from Africa to the New World and sugar, tobacco and bullion from the New World to Europe.

It was not until the 19th century, with the opening of the Suez and Panama canals and the construction of transcontinental railways in Canada, the United States, Siberia and Africa, that areas and lines of commerce which had previously been separate finally blended into a single economy on a world scale (see p. 263). But the first stages of global integration were completed in just over two centuries beginning in 1500.

1487 TO 1780
EUROPEAN VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY
Between 1480 and 1780, European explorers discovered and mapped almost all of the world’s seas and the outlines of almost all the continents. Impelled by a variety of motives—trade, personal enrichment, glory and, by the 18th century, scientific knowledge—their legacy is today’s world map, a common resource of all mankind.
In 1480 the principal seafaring peoples of the world were separated not only by great expanses of uncharted sea but by continental landmasses whose extent and shape were unknown. Regular European shipping was still mainly confined to the north Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Baltic. The west African coast had been explored cursorily and only very recently by Europeans, while the coast from Gaboon to Mozambique was unknown to any regular long-range shipping. In the Americas, limited raft and canoe-borne sailing took place on the Pacific coasts of Ecuador and Peru and in the Caribbean, but there was no communication with Europe nor, so far as is known, with other parts of the Pacific.

In the east, several seafaring peoples overlapped. Indian, Persian and Arab ships plied the northern Indian Ocean. Chinese shipping, which in the past had sailed intermittently to east Africa, by 1480 usually went no farther than Malacca, sharing the shallow seas of the Malay archipelago with local shipping, chiefly Javanese. To the east, it went no farther than the Philippines. No shipping used the southern Indian Ocean: Javanese contacts with Madagascar had long ceased. The great expanses of the central Pacific were crossed only occasionally and perilously by Polynesian canoes. In the north Pacific, except in Japanese and Korean coastal waters, there were no ships at all.

THE SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE
The European voyages of discovery began early in the 15th century when Portuguese navigators advanced southward, round the west coast of Africa, in search of gold, slaves and spices, until in 1487 Dias and de Covilha brought them into the Indian Ocean. Thenceforth voyages of exploration multiplied, particularly after the resurgence of Islam made the old route to the east via Alexandria and the Red Sea precarious.

While the Spanish sailed west, the Portuguese explored the eastern route to Asia. Once in the Indian Ocean they quickly reached their goal: Malabar (1498), Malacca (1509) and the Moluccas (1512). The Spanish search for a western route to the Spice Islands was less successful but its unintended and momentous result was Columbus’s discovery of the New World in 1492 followed by the Spanish conquest of the Americas (see p. 159). But it was not until after 1524, when Verazzano traced the coastline of North America as far north as Nova Scotia, that the existence of the new continent was generally accepted.

Meanwhile the search for a western route to Asia continued, leading to extensive exploration of the Caribbean. Finally, in 1521 Magellan rounded South America, entered the Pacific and reached the Philippines, but his route would prove too long and too hazardous for commercial purposes. In 1557 the Portuguese occupied Macao and after 1571 Spanish galleons traded between Manila and Acapulco in Mexico. The combined effect of these Spanish and Portuguese voyages had been to show that all the oceans of the southern hemisphere were connected. At the same time, for about a century Spain and Portugal were able to prevent other Europeans from using these connecting sea passages, other than for occasional raids.

THE FRENCH, BRITISH AND DUTCH
As a result, the exploration of the Pacific was delayed until the 18th century. In part at least it was inspired as much by scientific curiosity as by hope of commercial gain. It was the work of British, Dutch and Russians seeking a navigable passage via the Arctic between the Atlantic and the Pacific and hoping also to locate a hypothetical southern continent. Both proved illusory but the result was the charting of New Zealand and the eastern coast of Australia, both opened in a few years to European colonization.

Meanwhile, England and France, unwilling to recognize the monopoly claimed by Spain and Portugal in the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, had embarked on a series of voyages intended to reach Asia by a northern route. All these proved abortive and were abandoned after 1632, but they resulted in the opening of North America to European settlement. The English, French and Dutch were also unwilling to abandon the profitable trade with south and southeast Asia to the Portuguese and Spaniards and the later years of the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries saw a determined and ultimately successful effort to breach their privileged position (see p. 178).

After 1500 direct sea contact was established between continents and regions which hitherto had developed in isolation. It was necessarily a slow process and for a long time the European footholds in Asia and Africa remained tenuous. But by the time of the death of the last great explorer, James Cook in 1779, few of the world’s coastlines remained to be explored.

1500 TO 1700
EXPANSION OF THE TRADING EMPIRES
Portuguese 16th-century traders established Europe’s trading links with Africa, India, the Malay archipelago, China and Japan and dominated the African trade in gold and slaves. But by the 17th century growing Dutch, British and French competition was challenging both Portugal’s position and Spain’s dominance in the West Indies.

The discoveries by European explorers in the late 15th century were rapidly exploited. By 1500, Portuguese possessions outside Europe included several island groups in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Guinea, and a number of trading stations on the west coast of Africa—above all the fortress-factory of Elmina. A dozen or so ships made the voyage between Portugal and Guinea every year, bartering hardware and cloth for slaves and gold dust.

After the sea route to India was discovered, the Portuguese attempted to become the main suppliers of spices to Europe by capturing or leasing trading posts and fortified bases on the east coast of Africa, around the north shores of the Indian Ocean and in the Malay archipelago. By the mid-16th century, they had a tenuous string of more than 50 forts and factories. Strategically, the most important were Mozambique (1507), Goa (1510), Ormuz (1515) and Malacca (1511). East of Malacca, the Portuguese position was precarious and their activity completely commercial. In 1557, with the agreement of the Chinese, they established a base at Macao. From there, they traded to Nagasaki, where they were welcomed as carriers of Chinese goods, since the Chinese themselves were forbidden to trade with Japan. At Ternate, they maintained a warehouse until 1575, when they were expelled by a league of Muslim princes.

PORTUGAL’S TRADING EMPIRE
All these Far Eastern enterprises, together with the gold of the Zambezi basin, exported through Sofala, paid for the pepper and other spices shipped annually from Goa to Lisbon for distribution to western Europe. Though the Portuguese never achieved anything like a monopoly, their power was sufficient to channel much of the Indian Ocean trade through harbours under their control, and for 100 years they had no real European rivals. Only the Spanish, whose main interest lay in the Americas, showed a parallel interest in the Far East (see p. 159).

Once the Portuguese had started to settle Brazil in the 1530s, the Brazilian demand for slave labour breathed new life into the Portuguese trading stations in west Africa, where the gold trade had dwindled as the gold became exhausted and caused traders to extend their operations from Guinea south to Angola. The Portuguese slave depot of Luanda was founded in 1575 and slave ships shuttled directly between Angola and Brazil, with the slaves paid for by Brazilian tobacco.

DUTCH EXPANSION
From the opening years of the 17th century, the Portuguese in the East began to experience significant competition from other European countries. This usually organized itself in the form of joint stock companies, empowered to trade, settle, conquer, administer and defend. The most formidable, at least to begin with, was the Dutch East India Company, formally incorporated in 1602. In 1619, this vast concern, the biggest trading corporation in Europe, established its eastern headquarters at Batavia, well to the south (and east) of Goa and Malacca, thus acquiring a permanent strategic advantage. Its ships pioneered a direct route to Batavia, provisioning (after 1652) at the new Dutch settlement at the Cape of Good Hope, then running east before the “roaring forties” and entering the archipelago by the Sunda Strait. By acquiring bases in strategic locations, by bringing pressure on local rulers and by squeezing other Europeans out, it established a monopoly of the more valuable trades of the archipelago. Elsewhere in the East it traded in competition with native and European merchants on terms dictated by local rulers, though throughout the 17th century it held its own against all European rivals.

EUROPEAN RIVALRIES
The English East India Company, incorporated in 1600, was a rather smaller concern and usually proved unable to resist Dutch pressure in the archipelago. It engaged principally in trade in cotton goods and pepper from India, first at the Mughal port of Surat, later at stations of its own at Madras, Bombay and Calcutta. In 1685 it began a modest trade with China, purchasing tea and porcelain at Amoy and later at Canton, where from 1698 its agents found themselves in direct competition with the French Compagnie de Chine.

As a result of the commercial competition and naval aggression of these corporations (which continued irrespective of whether there was formal war or peace in Europe), the Portuguese Estado de India shrank both in territorial extent and in commercial profit. The Red Sea and the Persian Gulf both became commercial backwaters as the joint-stock companies carried more and more of the trade between Europe and Asia in their own capacious and well-armed ships. Meanwhile, the Dutch West India Company—less well entrenched than its eastern counterpart, but formidable nonetheless—conquered the Brazilian coastal region of Pernambuco in 1630 and over the next few years seized the Portuguese slaving stations in west Africa, without which the Brazilian plantation system appeared unworkable. But in the 1640s, with the end of the long period of union (1580–1640) of the Spanish and Portuguese crowns, the Portuguese recovered the Angola slave-pens and in 1654 drove the Dutch from Brazil. The West India Company now turned its attention to the Caribbean.

1462 TO 1815
RUSSIAN EXPANSION IN EUROPE AND ASIA
The Grand Duchy of Muscovy emerged in the late 15th century as a powerful state with claims to the legacy of Kievan Rus. Though it spread rapidly east and south, expansion in the west was blocked by Lithuania, which included many of the lands of Kievan Rus. Only after 1648 did Muscovy prevail, laying the foundations of the Russian empire.

The ebbing of Mongol power and the collapse of the Byzantine empire opened the way for the emergence of Muscovy as a European power. Proclaiming Muscovy’s independence from the Mongols in 1480, Ivan III (1462–1505) laid claim to the heritage of Kievan Rus and, by marrying the daughter of the last Byzantine emperor and adopting the double-headed eagle as his emblem, to that of Byzantium. The last independent Orthodox state after 1453, Muscovy proclaimed itself the leader of the Orthodox world, with Moscow raised to a metropolitanate in 1448 and a patriarchate in 1589.

Muscovy’s growing power was manifested in the ruthless annexations of Novgorod (1478) and Pskov (1510) and the seizure of Smolensk from Lithuania (1514). The conquest of the khanates of Kazan (1552) and Astrakhan (1556) conferred control of the Volga and opened the way to the east and the south. Expansion was not so easy to the west, where the tsars’ claim to rule “all the Russias” was challenged by the grand dukes of Lithuania, most of whose subjects were eastern Slavs with elites increasingly attracted by the participative political system of Poland. The 1569 Union of Lublin between Poland and Lithuania, which saw the direct incorporation of Lithuania’s Ukrainian territories into the kingdom of Poland, led to the creation of a sophisticated noble democracy with a common diet (parliament) and an elective monarchy that was in stark contrast to the centralized Muscovite autocracy.

Between 1558 and 1634, Poland-Lithuania repulsed all Muscovite attempts to expand westwards. Ivan IV’s attempts to take Livonia were beaten off, Sigismund III regained Smolensk and Chernigov at the Treaty of Deulino (1618/19), while during the “Time of Troubles” (1605–13), Sigismund’s son Wæadysæaw was elected tsar by a group of boyars, and a Polish garrison occupied the Kremlin (1610–12). A Muscovite attempt to retake Smolensk in 1632–4 was repulsed decisively.

GROWTH OF EMPIRE
The turning-point came during the Thirteen Years’ War (1654–67). At the 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav, Tsar Alexis Mikhailovich (1645–76) extended Muscovy’s protection to the Zaporozhian Cossacks, who had rebelled against Poland in 1648. Although Alexis failed to hold on to the large areas of Lithuania annexed in 1654–5, the 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo granted Muscovy those areas of the Ukraine on the left bank of the Dnieper and, albeit only for three years, Kiev, though in 1686 the Poles were forced to recognize its permanent loss. The capture of Kiev and left-bank Ukraine made good part of the tsars’ claim to rule all the Russias; the Ukraine was dubbed “Little Russia” in contrast to “Great Russia”, the empire’s Muscovite heartland. Muscovy had become Russia.

As Poland-Lithuania weakened, Russian expansion continued. The military improvements under Alexis were completed by his son, Peter I (the Great), who captured Azov from the Ottomans before turning his attention northwards. In a long war, marked by his great victory at Poltava in 1709, Peter finally wrested Estonia and Livonia from Sweden at the Treaty of Nystad (1721), acquired the ancient port of Riga and founded the new one of St Petersburg.

His successors reverted to the policy of expansion in the south, which was carried to a successful conclusion by Catherine II (the Great) in her first (1768–74) and second (1787–92) Turkish wars. The Crimea was annexed, and Russia now controlled the northern shore of the Black Sea from the Dniester to the Caucasus. The period from 1772 to 1815 then saw the Russian land frontier advanced by 965km (600 miles) at the expense of Poland. By the partitions of 1772, 1793 and 1795 (see p. 202), Russia obtained much of the former Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the process acquiring a further 5.5 million inhabitants. Indeed throughout the period as a whole the population of Russia expanded dramatically from an estimated 10 million in 1600 to nearly 43 million in 1812.

1500 TO 1810
NORTH AMERICA
While the Spanish and the Portuguese had established large and lucrative empires in the south of the Americas, their northerly European neighbours focused on the lands to the north. John Cabot, commissioned by the English king Henry VII, made the first documented voyage to North America (since the Vikings) in 1497.

After John Cabot’s voyage, fishing vessels from England, France, Portugal and the Basque country soon travelled in large numbers to the rich cod grounds off Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. However, these fishing voyages led to relatively little interest in the continent and did not result in settlement. French imperial interest in North America began with Jacques Cartier’s voyages in the 1530s. However, unlike Spanish and Portuguese colonization to the south, French and English attempts to colonize the north in the early 16th century failed. Jamestown, Virginia (1607), Quebec (1608), the Mayflower communities of Massachusetts Bay (1620), and New Amsterdam (1626) represented the first successes in establishing European colonies in North America. Beset by many difficulties, these colonies grew slowly and often at the sufferance of surrounding aboriginal groups. Swedish and Scottish attempts at colonization remained small-scale. The more significant Dutch settlement in New Amsterdam (New York) was taken over by the English in 1664. Tobacco, grains and furs proved valuable commodities for export to the mother countries.

The European arrivals brought new military dangers as well as opportunities for the aboriginal peoples. While some groups were exterminated by the Europeans (in the Massachusetts area, for instance), other groups (such as the Iroquois of the Great Lakes region) were able to play one group of foreigners off against another and to expand their areas of influence. North American aboriginal peoples maintained a strong military role—as valued allies or feared opponents—at least until the War of 1812; and some groups, such as the Comanches, continued to resist the incursions of foreigners into their territories until late in the century.

Spain, too, made its presence felt in what is now considered North America - in Florida, Texas, New Mexico, and later Louisiana. Settlers in the British colonies tended to be from minority religions or religious sects, while in the French and Spanish colonies non-orthodox Catholics were strongly discouraged from settling. Relatively few French settlers made their way across the Atlantic, and the majority of these returned home. Nonetheless, given the high birth rate—made possible by living conditions that were better than in the mother country—the population of New France grew dramatically. It did likewise in the British colonies to the south, where a stronger stream of immigrants boosted the population from generation to generation. At the time of the American Revolution, some 2.5 million people lived in the colonies which rebelled against British rule.

In the interior of the continent, more varied communities developed. These combined aboriginal and European bloodlines and cultures. Métis (mixed blood) communities became vitally important to the success of the fur trade, which led the French down the Great Lakes and Ohio and Mississippi systems. However, while diversity reigned in the 18th century, these communities could do little to resist the expansion of American settlement in the 19th century.

POLITICAL HOSTILITY AND MILITARY THREAT
Despite its small size, the French contingent, with its aboriginal allies, represented an ongoing military threat to the English colonies. In 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht ceded peninsular Nova Scotia to the British, and withdrew French claims to Newfoundland and the Hudson Bay fur-trading posts. With the War of the Austrian Succession (1743–48) and the French and Indian War (1754–60), also known as the Seven Years’ War, the battle between British and French interests came to a head. At the battle of the Plains of Abraham, the French were defeated and Britain temporarily unified the eastern half of the continent under its rule.

The costs of this war—and the English government’s desire to exact some payment from the American colonists who had ostensibly benefited from the removal of the French threat—contributed to the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and the colonies in the American War of Independence (1775–83). The war’s end saw the forced removal of thousands of erstwhile loyalists, many of whom moved to remaining British colonies to the north.

1500 TO 1825
LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
Within 40 years of Columbus’s discovery of America, the Spanish had overturned the rich empires of the Aztec and the Inca. For over a century longer, the Spanish and the Portuguese dominated the “New World”, but in the 17th century the French, English and Dutch began to establish footholds in the Caribbean islands and the Guianas. New colonial societies were emerging, however, which sought to cast off European control.

By 1500, in the wake of Columbus’s voyages, around 6,000 Spaniards had already immigrated to the New World. For over a century the Spanish were to dominate the settlement of the Americas. The pace of colonization accelerated enormously after the discovery and conquest of two fabulously rich empires: the Aztec in Mesoamerica and the Inca in the Andean region. Relatively small Spanish forces were able to conquer these societies fairly easily by exploiting existing divisions within them; they were further assisted by the native people’s heavy population losses brought about by the introduction of Old World diseases. The Spanish set up a vast bureaucratic system to administer the new colony, and they established many towns, very often on the sites of pre-existing Indian settlements. Mexico and Peru had rich deposits of gold and silver, so they became the main focuses of Spanish settlement in the New World. Few exports could compete with silver, but some sugar, cacao, indigo and cochineal were also shipped to Spain. As a result of conquest, disease and ill treatment, the Indian population fell by about 90 per cent within the first 150 years of European arrival.

THE PORTUGUESE
By the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 the Spanish and Portuguese had established a line of demarcation between them in the New World, with the Portuguese allocated the territories east of the line. However, in the early years the Portuguese traded only on the coast of Brazil for dyewoods, and it was not until 1549 that their administrative capital was established at Bahia (today Salvador). In the absence of a large native workforce, African slaves had to be imported to work the sugar plantations. In the 1690s gold was discovered in the Minas Gerais—meaning General Mines in Portuguese—and this provoked massive immigration from Portugal and led to the growing importance of Rio de Janeiro.


BEYOND THE FRONTIERS
Few Europeans ventured outside the main centres of settlement and commercial activity, where the Indian populations were smaller and the opportunities for wealth creation fewer. However, both nations were obliged by papal bulls to convert the indigenous people to Catholicism. They therefore supported the activities of the missionary orders, notably the Jesuits and Franciscans, who through their establishment of missions gradually pushed back the frontier of settlement.
At the same time the French, Dutch and English tried to challenge Spanish and Portuguese power. At first they did this by sponsoring pirates, but later they began promoting settlement in areas where Spanish and Portuguese control was weak, notably in the Caribbean islands and the Guianas, from where they attempted to undermine them economically through contraband trade.

MOVES FOR INDEPENDENCE
Conditioned by the new environment, the mix of traditions brought by the various settlers and the indigenous peoples they encountered, the societies that emerged in the New World were very different from those that the first settlers had left behind in Europe. During the second half of the 18th century, there were increasing moves to gain independence from Spain, with Mexico achieving independence in 1821 and most other countries, apart from Cuba and Puerto Rico, by 1825. Brazil had to wait until 1889 for political independence, although in 1822, when the Portuguese court returned to Europe following the defeat of Napoleon, it acquired considerable economic independence.

1500 TO 1800
TRADE AND EMPIRE IN AFRICA
From 1500 to 1800 African history was dominated by three main processes: the expansion of large political units; the spread of Islam; and the increasing involvement of Europeans. By 1800 Africans had made great progress in evolving distinctive social and political forms, but their independence was already seriously compromised.

From the late 15th century, large political units multiplied in Africa. In 1464, Sunni Ali became ruler of the Songhay people around Gao in the eastern Niger bend. Under Askia the Great (1493–1528), Songhay became a great empire, incorporating a number of important commercial cities including Timbuktu and Jenne, which developed into centres of learning and Muslim piety. In the savannah and forest country to the south, trading communities gave rise to comparable polities. Well before 1500 Oyo and Benin had emerged in the woodlands to the west of the Niger delta, producing superb terracottas and bronzes.

Elsewhere, similar processes gave rise to centralized states of iron-working agriculturists and cattle-keepers. Increased populations, diversified economies and trade promoted stronger political control. When the Portuguese arrived south of the Congo mouth in 1484, they established close relations with the Kongo kingdom. Inland and to the south were other Bantu-speaking African states including those of the Luba and Lunda, while in the fertile lands between the east African lakes a series of states evolved, notably Rwanda and Buganda.
Equally prosperous was the Zimbabwe plateau with its kingdom based initially at Great Zimbabwe, later replaced by a number of successors including the Mwenemutapa empire centred northeast of modern Harare. At its peak Great Zimbabwe was the political and religious centre of a major state with trade links extending as far as China.

THE SPREAD OF ISLAM
Between 1500 and 1800 Islam consolidated its position in the Sudanic lands, and spread southward along the east African coast. Bitter rivalry between Christian Ethiopia and Muslim coastal states in the Horn then developed: Sultan Ahmad Gran of Adal invaded the Christian highlands in the 1520s, and was only defeated by Portuguese intervention.
Meanwhile, in 1517, the Ottomans conquered the Mamluks in Egypt, and subsequently extended their control over Tripoli and Tunis; Algiers was ruled by corsair princes subject to the Ottomans. Only Morocco remained independent, governed for much of this period by Sharifian dynasties. In 1590, Morocco invaded the Songhay empire and set up a client state, disrupting economic life throughout the region. Later, in the 18th century, the politics and commerce of Muslim west Africa recovered again in a burst of Islamic proselytizing.

EUROPEANS AND THE SLAVE TRADE
Throughout the period, Europeans became more involved in Africa, seeking gold, ivory, wood and, above all, slaves to work the mines and plantations of the Americas. Although by 1800 the number of European territorial possessions was small, their domination of oceanic trade had considerable effects in many parts of Africa. In southernmost Africa, Dutch and French Huguenot settlers arrived after 1652 and subjected the Khoisan peoples, but by 1800 they encountered serious resistance from the southeastern Bantu-speakers.
Europeans established “factories” along the coast from Senegal to Angola and bought slaves from Africans. Between 1450 and 1870 some 11,500,000 slaves were exported, first to Europe and then to the Americas. The death rate probably totalled 25 per cent. Most came from west Africa, though by 1800 east Africa, which had long provided slaves to the Muslim world, was contributing to the Atlantic system. The precise effects of the slave trade are unclear. Overall, Europeans gained and Africa’s development was inhibited.

1368 TO 1644
CHINA AT THE TIME OF THE MING DYNASTY
By the late 14th century a new Chinese dynasty, the Ming, had overthrown the Mongols. For 200 years it brought order and prosperity to much of China. The population more than doubled, new crops were introduced, industry flourished and trade greatly increased. By the early 17th century, corruption, external attack and crop failures conspired to weaken Ming rule and bring about its collapse.
By the late 13th century Mongol rule in China had brought a measure of stability even to the north of the country, which had endured the worst of the Mongol depredations 50 years earlier. But the death of the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan in 1294 sparked further instability as rival claimants fought for the imperial throne. By the 1340s and ’50s, dynastic decline was accelerated by floods, droughts and disease. Together with increasing discontent with Mongol rule, these touched off a series of uprisings against the government. The most serious was in central and southeastern China where, in 1368, Chu Yüan-chang, the most powerful of the rebels, proclaimed a new dynasty, the Ming. By 1388, the Mongols were driven back to the steppe and the Ming controlled all China.

CONSOLIDATION
Under the Ming, stability was restored and numerous improvements to the country’s agricultural base made. Throughout the period, new agricultural techniques enabled the country to feed its rapidly growing population more efficiently. New crops were introduced—some, such as yams, maize, peanuts and potatoes, by the Portuguese and Spanish—and new areas opened up to cultivation. To facilitate the movements of products and people, the Grand Canal, which would eventually stretch 1600km (1000 miles), from Hang-chou to Peking, was built. Upwards of 20,000 barges carrying 200,000 tons of grain a year used the canal. The administration of the burgeoning Chinese state was simple and practical. Though it discouraged innovation and, being highly centralized, was dangerously dependent on the emperor, it proved effective. Control over the vast population was effected largely through the “gentry”, or shen-shih, degree-holders who had been through the education system and shared the values of the bureaucracy without actually holding office.

Within the new stability provided by the Ming, industry boomed. The great cities of the Yangtze delta—Nanking, Su-chou, Wu-hsi, Sung-chiang and Hang-chou—developed as major industrial centres, particularly for textiles. The enormous volume of trade that flowed through them gave rise to a number of powerful groups of merchants, whose influence came to extend across the country. By the late 16th century, the economy was further stimulated by inflows of silver from the New World, which were used to pay for Chinese exports of tea, silk and ceramics.

OVERSEAS EXPANSION
Ming China, especially under the Yung-lo emperor, successor to Chu Yüanchang, was exceptionally expansionist and aggressive. Campaigns against the Mongols in the far north, the occupation of Annam from 1407 to 1427 and a series of immense seaborne expeditions extended China’s reach to new and unprecedented limits. But the return on these extravagant ventures was never enough to justify them. Following a further and abortive attack against the Mongols in 1449, which ended with the capture of the Ming emperor himself, China reverted to its traditional defensive posture. Renewed Mongol attacks coupled with a succession of political and economic demands placed the empire under increasing strain. It was made considerably worse by persistent attacks on the south coast by Japanese-based pirates and smugglers. By the 1550s, the seas around China were infested by heavily armed bands who terrorized coastal regions. Exacerbating China’s difficulties, at the end of the century Japan launched a costly and destructive invasion of Korea, obliging China to send huge armies to aid their vassal.

These threats both coincided with and were partly responsible for a decline in Ming power, a process made worse by growing government corruption and a series of crop failures in the north. By 1636, much of the country was in rebellion, with the Manchus in the forefront. Though it was to be another rebel leader, Li Tzu-ch’eng, who in 1644 toppled the Ming, his regime was itself overthrown almost immediately by the new Ch’ing dynasty from Manchuria. It was to exercise its iron grip over China until 1911.

1522 TO 1800
OTTOMAN TURKEY
In the early modern period, the Ottoman sultanate dominated the Balkans, Anatolia, the Middle East and much of north Africa. Despite increasing political paralysis after the death of Suleiman the Maganificent in 1566, the Ottoman army and navy remained formidable. In the 18th century, the sultanate came under increasing threat from Russia and the Habsburg empire, but it was also a period of great cultural achievement.

In the first three decades of the 16th century the frontiers of the Ottoman empire expanded rapidly. In 1514 the defeat of the Safavids (see p. 168) at Çaldiran ensured that eastern Anatolia remained under Ottoman rule. In 1517 the troops of the sultan Selim the Grim took Syria and Egypt from the last of the Mamluks. Under his son, Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–66), the empire reached its height. The Ottoman janissaries were the most disciplined and formidable fighting force of the time. The administration, headed by the grand vizier, was both effective and honest. Suleiman embarked on campaigns of conquest in the Balkans, and in 1526 his victory at Mohács led to the incorporation of most of Hungary into the Ottoman empire; in 1529 he came close to taking Vienna. The supremacy of the Ottoman fleet in the Mediterranean made possible the conquest of Rhodes in 1522 and of Algiers in 1529, but they failed to take Malta from the Knights of St John after an epic siege in 1565. Naval bases were established at Suez in 1517 and Basra in 1538 to enable Ottoman ships to sail the Red Sea and the Gulf. Suleiman was also the patron of the great architect Sinan, whose buildings—notably the Suleimaniye mosque and tomb complex—still dominate the skyline of Istanbul.

THE EMPIRE UNDER PRESSURE
Although the expansion faltered after the death of Suleiman, Ottoman power remained strong. The naval defeat at Lepanto in 1571 was only a temporary setback. The sultans were able to take Cyprus in 1571, Tunis from the Habsburgs in 1574, and Crete from the Venetians in 1662. Campaigns in the east led to the conquest of Yerevan in Armenia in 1635 and the taking of Baghdad from the Persians in 1638. As late as 1683 the Ottoman army, led by the grand vizier Kara Mustafa, was able to lay siege to Vienna.

The years after the death of Suleiman saw the internal administration of the empire becoming increasingly paralysed as palace officials and the harem took over political power. The queen mother or sultan valide was often the most important person in the sultanate, and the army was dominated by the janissaries, which were by now an ill-disciplined rabble who resented any attempts at reform and deposed any sultan or grand vizier who threatened their privileged status. The rule of the mad sultan Ibrahim (1640–8) saw the nadir of the sultan’s power, but under the Köprülü viziers (1656–76) the administration was once again established on a firm footing.

In the 18th century the empire came under increasing pressure on its European frontiers, and the Ottomans were forced to cede Hungary and Transylvania to the Habsburgs and the lands north of the Black Sea to the Russians. In the east, the collapse of the Safavids in 1722 meant that the frontier with Iran remained largely peaceful. The 18th century was also a period of cultural achievement typified by the “Tulip Age” patronized by the cultivated bibliophile Sultan Ahmet III (1703–30). Nevertheless, in 1800 the Ottoman empire was still the major power in the Middle East and southeast Europe.

1501 TO 1906
IRAN FROM THE SAFAVIDS TO THE QAJARS
The rule of the Safavid and Qajar dynasties saw the consolidation of Iran within its modern frontiers and the adoption of Shi’ite Islam as the national religion. The 18th century was a period of great disruption and violence. In the 19th century, the Qajar Shahs struggled to retain their independence from Russian and British influence. Afghanistan became an independent kingdom in the 19th century but the Uzbek Khanates were unable to resist Russian power.

In 1501 a new era in the history of Iran began with the coming to power of the Safavid Isma’il I. The Safavids came from Ardabil in Azerbaijan and their first capital was at Qazvin in northern Iran. Under Isma’il I (d.1524) the frontiers of Iran were consolidated. In the northeast, the lands beyond the Kopet Dag mountains, including Merv, Bukhara and Samarkand, were lost to the Uzbek Shaybani Khans and the modern frontier of Iran was established. In the west, the forces of the Safavids were defeated by the Ottomans at the battle of Çaldiran in 1514 which ensured that eastern Anatolia remained firmly in Turkish hands. It was at this time too that Shi’ite Islam became the state religion, clearly differentiating the Safavid empire from the Ottomans and the Uzbeks, both of whom were Sunnis.

The high point of Safavid power was reached under Shah Abbas I (the Great) (1588–1629) who established a new capital at Isfahan, which was expanded and endowed with a series of mosques, palaces and bridges, forming one of the glories of Persian architecture. In 1623 the Safavids took Baghdad and much of Iraq but this had to be surrendered to the Ottomans in 1639. By the early 18th century the Safavid empire was in decline and in 1722 Isfahan was sacked by the Ghilzai Afghans.

The 18th century was a period of violence and confusion in Iran. The throne was seized by a military adventurer called Nadir Shah, who invaded India and sacked Delhi in 1738–9 but was murdered in 1747. From 1750 to 1779 the main power in the land was the peaceful Karim Khan Zand, ruling from Shiraz.

In 1779 the leader of the Qajar Türkmen of northeastern Iran, Agha Muhammad Khan, established his control over most of the country and the Qajars were to rule as Shahs of Iran until 1924. In 1786 he moved the capital to Tehran which until then had been only a small village. In the period of Qajar rule, Iran came under increasing pressure from Russian influence in the north and the British in India and the Gulf, but the country retained its independence. However, they were forced to cede their claims to sovereignty in the Caucasus to the Russians at the treaty of Turkmenchay in 1828, and Herat to the Afghans in 1857. In 1906 political resistance to the absolutism of the shahs led to the granting of a constitution.

In the east, Dost Muhammad (1819–63) proclaimed himself Amir of Kabul and laid the foundations of modern Afghanistan, playing off the British and the Russians to secure the frontiers of his state. In the lands to the northeast, the Uzbek rulers established the Khanates of Bukhara, Khiva and Kokand, but they were unable to resist Russian encroachment and lost Tashkent in 1865 and Khiva in 1873. By 1900, the Qajars and the Tsarist Russians shared common frontiers in Azerbaijan and northeast Iran.

1526 TO 1803
MUGHAL INDIA AND THE GROWTH OF BRITISH POWER
Founded in the early 16th century, the Mughal empire was at its height from the 1550s to the 1650s, presiding over a golden age of religious cooperation and cultural synthesis. But in the 18th century it rapidly disintegrated, with the British emerging as the victors over the French and the Maratha Hindus in the struggle for the succession.

In the 1520s Babur, who counted both Genghis Khan and Tamerlane among his ancestors, invaded India from Afghanistan. After defeating the Lodi sultan at Panipat in 1526, he began the establishment of the Mughal empire, but died before the foundations were secure. His son, Humayun, was expelled by the Afghans of Bihar under Sher Shah and it took a full-scale invasion, brilliantly consolidated by Babur’s grandson, Akbar (1556–1605), to restore Mughal rule. This now stretched from Bengal in the east and the Godavari river in the south, to Kashmir in the north and the Indus Valley in the west. Most of the Hindu Rajput princes became tributary allies, and the empire was administered by a new class of bureaucrats, the mansabdars, ranked in a military hierarchical system.

Akbar’s reign is one of the golden ages of Indian history. A standardized tax system was introduced; there was agricultural prosperity and buoyant trade. Policies of tolerance were adopted towards the non-Muslim majority and Akbar himself took wives from Rajput families. His patronage laid the foundations for a remarkable synthesis of Persian and Indian cultural forms. He presided over the development of Mughal miniature painting, which combined the traditions of the Safavid and Rajput schools. Under his son Jahangir (1605–27), Mughal painting reached its peak. Akbar’s red sandstone capital at Fatehpur Sikri expressed a striking synthesis of Islamic and Hindu traditions of architecture. The new style reached its climax under his grandson Shahjahan (1628–57), the builder of the Taj Mahal.

Akbar’s political inheritance included a ceaseless thrust towards territorial expansion, especially southwards. Under Aurangzeb (1658–1707) this brought confrontation with a new Hindu power, the Marathas, a kingdom founded by Sivaji in 1674. By 1700 the Marathas were ravaging the land from the Deccan to Bengal. There was also open internal disaffection from Rajputs, Sikhs and Jats. It used to be thought that these developments were the outcome of Aurangzeb’s revision of Akbar’s policies of toleration. It now seems clear that they arose from weaknesses in the economic and administrative structures of the empire.

MUGHAL DECLINE
After Aurangzeb’s death the empire quickly declined. The finishing stroke came from Persia when Nadir Shah’s army sacked Delhi in 1739. The former Mughal provinces of Oudh, Bengal and Hyderabad now offered only nominal allegiance to Delhi. In the south the Muslim state of Mysore grew into a formidable power under Haidar Ali and his son, Tipu Sultan. Over the course of the century the Maratha chiefs spread their territories deep into north, west, central and eastern India. The Mughal emperor became no more than a Maratha protégé.

THE EAST INDIA COMPANY
Simultaneously, India was undergoing its first major invasion from the sea. By the 1760s the English East India Company, having both defeated the French and been granted control over the revenues of Bengal by the Mughal emperor, was firmly established on the Indian shore. With these resources the Company was now able to sustain an army of over 100,000 men. Through military victories over the Marathas and Mysore, it came to occupy a continuous band of territory from the Gangetic plain to India’s southern coasts. In addition, by a system of subsidiary alliances, its suzerainty was recognized by many Indian rulers beyond its actual borders. In 1803 the Mughal emperor himself accepted British protection. British supremacy was now widely acknowledged.

1644 TO 1839
CHINA UNDER THE CH’ING DYNASTY
Under the Ch’ing dynasty China doubled in size and experienced a century of peaceful prosperity. But by the late 18th century economic decline brought about by rapid population growth sparked repeated revolts. The developing crisis was exacerbated by growing government inefficiency and Western economic intervention. By the 1830s China’s problems demanded urgent and radical change.

The Ch’ing dynasty was founded by a non-Chinese people, the Manchus, who in the early 17th century established a Chinese-style state in Manchuria with its capital at Mukden. When the Ming were toppled by the rebel Li Tzu-ch’eng in 1644, the Manchus invaded China and proclaimed a new dynasty. Though Ming resistance continued in the south and west for several decades, notably in the rebellion of the Three Feudatories of 1674–81, from 1652 Manchu rule was effectively established. The Ch’ing brought to China more than a century of internal peace and prosperity under three rulers of great ability, the emperors K’ang-hsi (1661–1722), Yung-cheng (1722–35) and Ch’ien-lung (1736–96), who also led the expansion of the Chinese empire into central Asia until it was almost doubled in size.

The Manchus maintained their predominant place in government, and above all in the military, but also established good working relationships with their Chinese officials. Only towards the end of the 18th century, as they became more and more influenced by Chinese education and culture, did the distinctive Manchu identity begin to fade. Exploitation by Chinese and Manchu alike led to many rebellions of peoples on the periphery: in Yunnan in 1726–9, among the Chinese Muslim minority in Kansu in 1781–4, among the Yao people of Kwangsi in 1790, among the Miao people of Kweichow in 1795–7, and most notably the massive Chin-ch’uan tribal risings in western Szechwan in 1746–9 and again in 1771–6, when order was finally restored only after ruinously expensive military operations.

POPULATION GROWTH
From the end of the 18th century rebel movements began to take new forms. The background was a developing economic crisis. The area available for agriculture, which had been expanded by the introduction of maize, sweet potato, ground nuts and tobacco in the 16th and 17th centuries, was now fully used. The population, meanwhile, grew inexorably, from 100 million to 300 million between 1650 and 1800 and to 450 million by 1850. This constantly growing population had to be fed by ever-more intensive cultivation of a limited area. By the end of the 18th century, there was widespread hardship and impoverishment which in turn sparked rebellions, usually inspired by secret societies: the rebellions of the Heaven and Earth Society, 1787–8; the White Lotus, 1796–1805; and the Eight Trigrams of 1813, which was accompanied by an attempted coup in Peking. Further risings took place among border peoples.

THE CRISIS OF GOVERNMENT
The developing economic crisis was exacerbated by the strains that external expansion placed on imperial financial administration and by a sharp decline in the quality of government. Corruption became endemic at every level of administration while the government itself failed to keep up with population growth, delegating more and more power to local gentry. A further factor was the import of opium by foreign powers into China to help pay for their extensive purchases of tea, silk, porcelain and handicrafts. By the 1830s opium imports were leading to a substantial drain of silver from China with concomitant damage to the economy and state finances.

By this time Manchu China was the world’s largest and most populous empire, directly controlling vast territories in inner Asia and treating as tributary states still larger areas: Korea, Indo-China, Siam, Burma, Nepal. But within this huge empire, effective Ch’ing administrative and military control was gradually declining, while inexorable economic pressures increased which could be cured only by large-scale technological innovation and radical reorganization. Neither was imminent and in the meantime China faced new pressures from the expansionist Western powers.

1392 TO 1953
KOREA
The transition from Koryŏ to Chosŏn rule in Korea was essentially smooth, as the same ruling clans retained power, although Chosŏn exchanged Buddhism for Neo-Confucianism. The Chosŏn dynasty survived a Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592, but it was ultimately Japanese imperialism which destroyed it in 1910. The harshness of Japanese rule gave rise to a liberation movement, but ideological divisions within it led to a bitter and damaging war in the 1950s and the division of the peninsula. It was only in the 1960s that economic recovery occurred and then only in the non-communist south.

The clans of the Koryŏ era (918–1392) maintained power in the transition to the Chosŏn dynasty (1392–1910), but the new dynasty broke with the past by rejecting other-worldly Buddhism and embracing Sung Neo-Confucianism as the new orthodoxy. The new dynasty brought in a “golden age” of governance. King Sejong (1418–50) commissioned agricultural and medical manuals for general welfare, expanded the world’s oldest use of moveable metal type and, in 1446, promulgated a new script that he had a personal hand in producing.

Chosŏn Korea was a model Confucian state. Dress was Ming; law was Ming; government organization and recruitment were Ming; and Korea established its own international order by accepting tribute from Manchurian tribes and Japanese, while the Ming took tribute from Korea. Social ideals derived from The Family Rites of Zhu-xi (Chu Hsi): reject Buddhism; practise ancestor rites; establish primogeniture; and enhance clan cohesion. Everyday life was metaphysical, and philosophy became politicized. Chosŏn was not plagued by powerful eunuchs, but court factionalism emerged to produce political gridlock.

In 1590, the Japanese threatened to invade China through Korea. Court opinion split along factional lines and nothing was done. The Japanese came in 1592, and did not withdraw until 1598. East Asia fell into war, with Japanese fighting Chinese in Korea using European arquebuses. Even a Portuguese priest accompanied Christian samurai to Korea. Korea was devastated. Japanese atrocities and pillage left lasting scars, and the war confirmed Korea as the geopolitical pivot of East Asia.

Korea again prospered by the late 1600s, developing balanced agricultural production, cash crops and trade. Because ideology preferred subsistence agriculture, urban centres never developed the commercial focus that they did in China or Japan. Aside from occasional disturbances, peace reigned, and Chinese and Japanese relations were cordial.

From 1800, a succession of boy kings resulted in weak leadership and strong in-laws. Corruption expanded and government became impotent from the 1860s. Systemic decline and climatic disturbance produced vulnerability to Japanese imperialism, which used gunboat diplomacy to obtain an unequal treaty in 1876. In 1882, Korea signed its first treaty with a Western power (USA), opening the country to Christianity and further trade. Economic dislocation and a new religion produced a peasant revolt in 1894. Japanese and Chinese troops intervened and stayed to fight each other in Korea for the first time since 1592. With victory over China, Japan then turned to eliminate a Russian threat and was victorious in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–5). Japan annexed Korea in 1910.

Harsh policies established a compliant agricultural colony and a peaceful independence movement in 1919 was brutally suppressed. Japan industrialized during World War I and relied on Korean rice for Japanese labourers. After 1920, Japanese capital launched Korean industrialization but used it to meet military needs as Japan expanded into Manchuria (1931) and then into China (1937). As the China War expanded, extreme assimilation policies were imposed on Korea. Names were Japanized, men were abducted as labourers and women abducted as sex slaves.

Korea became the forward base for the China theatre but was never attacked. In 1945, US and Soviet troops divided the country at the 38th parallel and, by October 1948, a communist north, under Kim Il Sung, and a non-communist south (Republic of Korea) had appeared. With Russian and Chinese support, Kim Il Sung attacked southwards in 1950 hoping to reunify Korea. The UN fielded an international (mostly American) force to repel the invasion. As UN forces approached the Yalu River Chinese armies intervened, just as the Ming empire had driven Japanese invaders south in 1593. Seoul exchanged hands four times. Battle lines stabilized near the 38th parallel, where the truce line runs today. Infrastructure was reduced to rubble. Millions died, and barbed wire still divides the peninsula. Post-war recovery was not apparent until the 1960s, when socialist planning in the north produced surplus, and military dictatorship in the south began an industrialization programme that took the Republic of Korea from US$85 per capita in 1962 to US$20,000 per capita in 2002.

1477 TO 1868
JAPAN UNDER THE SHOGUNATE
By 1600, the Tokugawa shoguns had pacified Japan. They tamed the feudal barons, controlled Buddhist institutions, disarmed the peasantry, harnessed imperial authority and monopolized diplomacy. Not until 1868 did the Tokugawa fall, powerless in the face of economic crisis, the return of Western powers and new enthusiasm for imperial rule.

With brutality and military brilliance, as well as much political imagination, Oda Nobunaga (1534–82) and Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536–98) laid the foundations on which the centralized feudalism of the Tokugawa shogunate was constructed. It was to prove remarkably enduring. After the fall of the last stronghold opposed to the rule of the Tokugawa shogun Ieyasu in 1615, Japan enjoyed over two centuries without war and with rapidly increasing prosperity.

THE DAIMYŌ
The Tokugawa effectively emasculated the power of the 260 or so daimyō or feudal barons. Though left largely autonomous in their domains and required to pay no taxes to the shogun, the daimyō were obliged to spend alternate years in Edo, where participation in elaborate courtly ceremonials was demanded as evidence of submissiveness.

If this “alternate attendance” system turned Edo into the most populous and thriving capital in the world, it also imposed massive burdens on the daimyō. With huge retinues to transport to and from the capital and residences and servants to maintain once there, the financial fragility of the daimyō was guaranteed and their potential for rebellion accordingly curtailed. However, the submission of the most powerful of these barons, the tozama or “outside lords”, such as Satsuma and Choshu, was always grudgingly given and more widespread resentment against the shoguns began to surface around 1700 as the debts to the rising merchant class, run up by the daimyō to finance their courtly rituals, deepened.

If the daimyō and their samurai retainers, together only 7 per cent of the population of Tokugawa Japan, constituted the most privileged of the social classes, a comparatively low status was accorded to merchants. This was because Confucianism, used by the Tokugawa as an ideological buttress, despised money-making. Paradoxically, Japanese merchants, based in cities such as Osaka, Kyoto and Edo, were left alone to develop their commercial contacts and a number, such as the Sumitomo family, acquired fabulous wealth. Though excluded from all forms of government, they left an increasingly important mark on the development of Japan. From around 1700, a brilliant and sophisticated alternative culture developed characterized by kabuki drama in Osaka in the 18th century and wood-block prints in Edo in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The bulk of the population, perhaps 80 per cent, consisted of the peasantry. The tax burden they owed their daimyō could be crippling, however, especially at times of poor harvests. Rural and urban uprisings in the 1730s, 1780s, 1830s and 1860s were directed at the daimyō and the merchant class alike and exposed the contradictions inherent in the Tokugawa system.

TOKUGAWA CONTROL
Aware of the emperor’s potential as a rival focus of authority, the Tokugawa isolated and carefully controlled the imperial court. The emperor himself, silent and symbolic, served to bestow legitimacy on Tokugawa rule. It was not until the 1850s, when the arrival of Westerners demanding trade with Japan effectively paralysed the Tokugawa, that the imperial court, backed by unrest at the inability of the Tokugawa to stand up to the West, reasserted itself.

But long before this undermining of their authority, the Tokugawa had established complete control over the country, monopolizing foreign trade and diplomacy and expelling most European merchants and missionaries. Yet however self-sufficient and hierarchical, Japan did not withdraw entirely from contact with the wider world. Formal diplomatic and trade relations were maintained only with Korea, but Japan traded with the Chinese and Dutch.

Nonetheless, by the end of the 18th century financial crisis and rural unrest prompted attempts at reform by the Tokugawa. All ended in failure. In 1854 and 1855, the Americans, British, Dutch and Russians extracted “friendship” treaties from the Tokugawa. These aggressive foreign intrusions coupled with the weak Japanese response provoked crisis. For once unsure of itself, the Tokugawa solicited advice from the daimyō and authorization from the imperial court, thus drawing both groups on to the political stage. In 1858, the Tokugawa signed trade treaties, with the Americans, then with the British, but without first seeking imperial approval. A wave of radicalism swept Japan which led to the fall of the Tokugawa.

1511 TO 1826
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE EUROPEAN POWERS
At the beginning of the 16th century the first Europeans, lured by the lucrative spice trade, arrived in southeast Asia. Though the Spanish and Portuguese established the first European settlements, in the longer run the Dutch and the British, exploiting divisions among the southeast Asians themselves, were the major beneficiaries.

When European traders and adventurers broke through into the Indian Ocean at the close of the 15th century, the great prize drawing them forward was the spices of southeast Asia. Here was untold wealth to be tapped. But here also, at one of the world’s main crossroads, where cultural influences from China and India intermingled, they found themselves in a region of great complexity - politically fragmented and divided between three religions (Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam) and many different types of state.

On the mainland, rival peoples and dynasties competed for hegemony. In the Malayan archipelago, the empires of Srivijaya and Majapahit were little more than memories, having split into many small states with little cohesion between them. This was the situation when Europeans first arrived in the region in the person of Alfonso de Albuquerque who in 1511 conquered the great international emporium of Malacca for the king of Portugal.

The Portuguese presence changed little at first. Albuquerque and his successors were there to dominate the spice trade and to this end built a chain of fortified trading stations linked by naval power. Provided this was accepted, they had no wish to interfere with the native potentates. Far more important, after the arrival on the scene of the Dutch and the English, was the challenge to the Portuguese trading monopoly presented by their European rivals. For most of the 17th century, this rivalry was the dominant factor.

THE DUTCH AND ENGLISH CONQUESTS
The Dutch in particular began a systematic conquest of the Portuguese settlements, capturing Malacca in 1641, before turning against the British. But in doing so, they were drawn into local politics. After establishing a base at Batavia in 1619, they interfered in succession disputes among the neighbouring sultans, to ensure their own position, and in this way gradually extended control over Java, expelling the British from Bantam in 1682. They had already driven them out of the Spice Islands at the “Massacre of Amboina” (1623) and by the seizure of Macassar (1667), as a result forcing the English East India Company to turn instead to the China trade. With this in view, the British acquired Penang on the west coast of Malaya in 1786, the first step in a process which was ultimately to make them masters of the Malay peninsula.

But this was still exceptional. Though European activities encroached on the outlying islands they had little impact on the mainland monarchies, which had no direct interest in European trade and were mainly concerned with extending their power at the expense of that of their neighbours. At the same time all the main centres were under pressure from the hill peoples of the interior, always waiting to assert their independence. But the main lines of development include the advance of Annam (Vietnam) at the expense of Cambodia, the rise of a new Burmese empire under Alaungpaya (1735–60) and successful Siamese resistance to Burmese enchroachment, in spite of Burmese conquest in 1767.

These events occured for the most part without European involvement even if, during the struggle for empire between France and England in the 18th century (see p. 199), some states were implicated. Already under Louis XIV, France had intervened in Siam against the Dutch. But such was the popular hostility engendered by French meddling in Siam that the dynasty they supported was overthrown and the French themselves were expelled. During the Anglo-French war in India after 1746, France supported the Mon rebellion in Burma, provoking the English East India Company to seize in reply the island of Negrais at the mouth of the Bassein river. Later, when the Burmese, foiled in their attempt to capture Siam, switched their efforts to the north, the British, fearing for the security of Bengal, again intervened. The result was the first Anglo-Burmese War (1824–6) and the British annexation of Assam, Arakan and Tenasserim.

ANGLO - DUTCH AGREEMENT
In Malaya there was similar encroachment on the native states when the British, rulers of Penang since 1786, established Singapore in 1819 as a free trade port after its acquisition by Sir Stamford Raffles, the British Lieutenant-Governor of Benkulen in Sumatra. This led to a conflict of interest with Holland which was only settled by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London of 1824, under which the British withdrew from Sumatra in return for Dutch withdrawal from Malacca.

But if by the early years of the 19th century the future Dutch and British colonial empires in southeast Asia were taking shape, the control directly exercised by the European powers was still loose, more concerned with trade than with imperial rule. The Portuguese and Dutch had dominated the spice and pepper trades, but they were largely content to receive surpluses produced by local peasants; it was not until 1830 that the Dutch introduced the “Culture System” in which the Javanese were forced to devote one-fifth of their lands to export crops. Only with the impact of the industrial revolution in Europe, and the rapidly expanding market for raw materials and the increased exports of finished goods it created, were the lives and fortunes of the peoples of the region seriously affected by the European presence.

1500 TO 1815
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY: AGRICULTURE AND SOCIETY
European agriculture as a whole improved only slowly between 1500 and 1800 and with marked regional contrasts. Southern and eastern Europe, the latter severely handicapped by feudalism, saw slow growth. But in northern Europe there were dramatic increases in agricultural productivity, above all in Britain and the Low Countries

From the early 16th century Britain and the Low Countries enjoyed an agricultural revolution which by 1800 had produced a highly efficient, commercialized farming system. But elsewhere in Europe agricultural techniques and levels of productivity had hardly changed since Roman times and most peasants produced only about 20 per cent more a year than they needed to feed their families and their livestock and to provide the next year’s seed. Consequently, in many countries about 80 per cent of the people worked on the land. In Britain and the Low Countries, however, the proportion fell rapidly during the late 18th century as improved agriculture met the food needs of the growing urban population.

THE NEW CROPS
Except in Britain and the Netherlands, most improvements came from the introduction of new, more productive crops, mainly from America. Thus the potato became a basic staple in western Europe, starting in Spain and Italy. In Ireland it allowed such a massive increase in population (from 2.5 to 8 million) that disaster struck when the crop failed in 1846. American maize, like the potato, gave a far higher yield than the established cereals—barley, millet and sorghum—and was widely adopted in southern Europe. Buckwheat, useful on poor soils, entered northern Europe from Russia while in the Mediterranean sugarcane, rice and citrus fruits had arrived from Asia before 1500. Sugar production declined after 1550, however, in the face of competition from Madeira, the Canaries and, after 1600, the West Indies and Brazil.

These slow crop changes contrasted strongly with the rapidly developing northwest. The Dutch began the process by pouring capital into reclaiming land from the sea. Naturally wishing to avoid having to leave land fallow every third year (necessary under the traditional system), they discovered that fertility could be maintained by simple crop rotation involving the alternation of arable with artificial grasses and industrial crops such as rapeseed, flax and dyestuffs. Turnips, on which sheep could be grazed in winter to produce manure as well as mutton and wool, were especially important, as were peas, beans and clovers. English farmers copied and developed these innovations. Irrigation, drainage schemes and woodland clearance increased the productive area, while land enclosure and soil treatments encouraged improved husbandry. By the 1740s, grain exports accounted for 10 per cent of England’s export earnings, and the old fear of starvation had been banished.

Such techniques gradually spread as the growth of towns encouraged more specialization in food production. Holland concentrated on dairy products and was exporting 90 per cent of her cheese by 1700. The Danes were sending 80,000 head of cattle a year to Germany, and the Dutch, German and Italian cloth industries were sustained by massive imports of Spanish wool. The exchange of northern Europe’s cereals and timber for the fruits, wines and oils of the Mediterranean grew apace.

PEASANTS AND FEUDALISM
All improvements in productivity depended on breaking the old feudal relationships which oppressed the peasants, however, and here there was a sharp east-west cleavage. Before 1500 feudalism had been stronger in the older settled areas of western Europe than in the sparsely peopled lands of eastern Europe and Russia. After 1500 this changed completely: peasants in northwest Europe exchanged the traditional labour services on their lords’ land for a money rent (especially in England and the Netherlands) or, in France and farther south, for share-cropping tenancies. They also gradually freed themselves from burdensome personal services and dues, though this required revolutionary action, inspired by France in 1789, before it was complete.

In total contrast, feudal power grew and spread in eastern Europe until it approached slavery. Feudal lords increased their power, halting migration to empty lands farther east (as in Russia) and increasing grain-export profits (as in eastern Germany and Poland-Lithuania). Free peasants only survived in newly conquered lands if they performed military service instead of paying rent. The peasants of western Germany occupied a middle position. They had tried to win their freedom in a great revolt in 1525, and briefly controlled most of southern Germany before the rebellion was savagely crushed. Yet the excesses of eastern Europe were averted, and the peasants gradually gained greater freedom by 1800. Their slow emancipation was, however, an important reason why the German industrial revolution came so late.

1550 TO 1775
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY: TRADE AND INDUSTRY
Population growth, expanding industry, the impact of colonial trade and changes to the banking system transformed Europe’s economic performance after 1500. At the same time, there was a decisive shift in the economic centre of gravity from southern to northern Europe. The Dutch Republic and, later, Britain emerged as the new economic powerhouses.

Europe’s population expanded fast in the 16th century, was retarded by famine, plague and war in the 17th century, but grew rapidly again from the mid-18th century. In 1500 only three cities—Constantinople (by far the largest), Paris and Naples—had more than 200,000 inhabitants. By 1700 this number had doubled, and London, Paris and Constantinople had passed the half million mark.

The increased complexity of government, an acceleration of trade and finance, a growing taste for conspicuous consumption, and a feeling that survival was better assured in the cities, all helped to hasten this trend. The resulting problems, particularly the need to guarantee reliable urban food supplies, also created new opportunities. Most notably, until the mid-17th century, they generated a massive demand for eastern Europe’s wheat and rye, a trade which fed the burgeoning economic strength of Holland, now nearly monopolizing the Baltic carrying trade.

The Netherlands in fact formed the hinge for a gradual but decisive shift in commercial power. In 1500 industry was largely concentrated in the corridor running north-south from Antwerp and Bruges to Florence and Milan. By 1700 this axis had swung through almost 90 degrees. At one end stood Britain and the Dutch Republic, increasingly the most dynamic commercial centres in Europe; eastward the line extended through the metal and woollen districts of the Rhine to the great industrial concentrations of Saxony, Bohemia and Silesia.

INDUSTRY, TRADE AND FINANCE
At the same time, however, technology advanced only in patches and much industrial expansion was chiefly achieved by increasing the number of workers while still using the old methods. But even this helped improve industrial organization, by splitting up production processes, developing production in rural areas free of urban restriction, and drawing on the cheap part-time labour of peasant families. Much industry was controlled by traders who organized a scattered cottage labour force. By the 18th century this had become the typical form of all but local and luxury industry.

More impressive than the erratic spread of industry was the increase in international trade. The maritime powers, with their colonies and ports in Asia and the Americas, imported a fast-growing stream of new products: tea, coffee, sugar, chocolate, tobacco. They were purchased with European manufactures and with the shipping, insurance and merchandising services that built up the wealth of ports such as Bordeaux, London, Amsterdam and Marseilles.

Governments assisted those sectors of economic activity that they favoured. Holland and England waged wars to protect and expand their shipping and trading interests, but did not consistently aid industry. The governments of France and the central European states, by contrast, established new industries and subsidized old ones. Increasingly costly wars, however, had an even more powerful influence. They called for heavy taxation and large borrowings that undermined the precarious stability of Europe’s gradually evolving monetary systems. The wars were ruinous to Spain and damaging to France and many smaller states; only Britain and the Dutch Republic coped succesfully thanks to their expanding economies and new credit systems.

Trade and war also generated an unprecedented demand for money. Gold and silver were amply provided from Spanish Mexico and Peru after 1545, supported from the 1690s by Brazilian gold. This bullion was redistributed across Europe by merchants and by Spanish government transactions, much of it financing Europe’s trade deficits with the East Indies and the Levant. The money supply was also supplemented by the growth of banking. In contrast to the established German and Italian banks, which were heavily engaged in government lending, Dutch and English banks served private interests with giro and foreign - exchange facilities and short-term credits. In the century after its opening in 1609, the Amsterdam Exchange Bank was the undisputed focus of continental trade; Britain could compete only after 1694, when the Bank of England provided a focus for older private banking firms. With low interest rates, free capital movement, secure international payments and an assured savings flow, the foundations of modern finance were firmly laid.

1517 TO 1670
REFORMATION AND CATHOLIC REFORMATION
The shattering of the unity of Latin Christendom altered the course of European history. The rise of assertive Protestant Churches and the reaction of the Catholic Church stimulated a battle for the consciences of ordinary Europeans which disrupted traditional loyalties and political arrangements. It was 150 years before an uneasy religious balance was restored.

In 1500 the Catholic Church seemed stronger than ever. Paganism was vanquished; the Iberian Reconquista had destroyed the last Islamic state in western Europe and the overthrow of the Byzantine empire in 1453 had weakened the Orthodox Church. Lay piety was booming, as was popular interest in the Church’s promise of salvation. Yet this very success brought profound problems. The moral and spiritual quality of many clergy left much to be desired. There was widespread concern at the state of the Church and of popular religious belief which, although often enthusiastic, was frequently characterized by ignorance or heterodoxy. Attempts at reform, however, were often undermined by the unresolved problem of authority within the Church, while the invention of the printing press, by dramatically quickening the pace of debate, facilitated the questioning of established truth by clergy and laity alike.

THE REFORMATION
The Reformation began as a revolt of the clergy, as Martin Luther (1483–1546), Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531), Martin Bucer (1491–1551) and many others rejected the authority of the Catholic Church, attacking the Papacy and basing their challenge on the authority of scripture, increasingly available in vernacular translations. These ideas proved attractive to many princes, who embraced reform. With the emergence of a second wave of Protestant reform spearheaded by the followers of the French reformer John Calvin (1509–64), an increasing number turned Protestant. Protestantism was already the official religion in large parts of northern Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Scotland and England, and Calvinism, which developed sophisticated theories justifying resistance to political authority, was spreading rapidly in the Netherlands, Poland-Lithuania, Hungary and France, where there were perhaps 1200 Calvinist churches by 1570.

CHALLENGES TO PROTESTANTISM
Yet confessional divisions were by no means fixed, and Protestantism faced growing problems. The Catholic Church began a vigorous recovery after the Council of Trent reaffirmed its doctrine in response to the Protestant challenge and launched an ambitious programme of reform. Protestantism, by rejecting Catholic mechanisms for sustaining orthodoxy, could not establish the universal Church to which the early reformers had aspired while discipline was always a problem, with radical sects such as Anabaptists and Antitrinitarians surviving vigorous persecution.

The second half of the 16th century was a period of adjustment, as rulers switched between brands of Protestantism, or even considered reunification with Rome, as in England under Mary Tudor (1552–8) or, more ambiguously, in Sweden under John III (1568–92). In eastern Europe, Catholicism outflanked Protestantism by negotiating the 1596 Union of Brest, in which most of the Orthodox hierarchy in Poland-Lithuania accepted papal authority in return for keeping the Orthodox rite. Orthodox resistance to this Uniate (Greek Catholic) Church was powerful, and it was only after 1650 that it began to flourish; similar Unions were established with the Ruthenians of northeast Hungary (1646) and the Romanian Orthodox Church (1697). In such unstable circumstances, it took time for new religious convictions to take root among the ordinary people and Protestant rulers found that old beliefs died hard even where people welcomed the destruction of the power of the Catholic clergy. Nevertheless, the religious differentiation of Europe proceeded apace and was accompanied by vicious civil wars and widespread persecution. It was only after 1660 that the religious map took on a more permanent shape, as the success of evangelization made it difficult for rulers to challenge the religious beliefs of their subjects. Only now were the religious divisions of the continent accepted, if not welcomed.

1500 TO 1688
EUROPE: THE STATE AND ITS OPPONENTS
Before 1688 European rulers struggled to impose their authority. Nobles, townspeople and peasants fought to protect privileges and to resist the fiscal demands of the state. The Dutch and Portuguese revolts led to independence while in France and Spain monarchs could only increase their power by working with the elites. In England cooperation with Parliament was essential, as Charles I discovered.

Despite their apparent strength, the monarchies of Europe continued to govern through the personal ties of clientage which had characterized monarchy in the feudal period. The state still relied on the goodwill of its nobles for the enforcement of its policies, and failure to retain the support of the landed classes could provoke major revolts. The French aristocracy staged several rebellions against the crown, culminating in the Fronde (1648–53); a section of the English aristocracy rebelled against Elizabeth I in 1569–70 (the “Northern Rising”) and many English peers supported Parliament’s stand against Charles I after 1640. Similarly, nobles in the Netherlands opposed their “natural prince”, Philip II of Spain, in 1566, 1572 and 1576 while those in Portugal rose against Philip IV in 1640.

These were only the most important rebellions of the period. Uprisings against the state were a continuing fact of life throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Some revolts arose from attacks on the privileges of the “estates”; others were caused by economic hardship—from taxes imposed at a time of high prices and widespread unemployment, as was the case in most French popular revolts, or from the enclosing of common land, which caused the revolts of 1549 and 1607 in England. Other uprisings—the Pilgrimage of Grace in England in 1536 and the Covenanting Movement in Scotland in 1638—were triggered by unpopular religious policies. In all cases the revolts were a response to attempts at innovation. Governments everywhere were endeavouring to create what James I of England described as: “one worship to God, one kingdom entirely governed, one uniformity of laws”. The problem, however, was one of means, not ends. Neither James nor any of his fellow sovereigns had the resources to enforce such ambitions. They simply lacked the revenues and the officials required.

THE AGE OF REVOLT
The barriers to centralization in Early Modern Europe were formidable. Many subjects did not speak the same language as their government (Breton and Provençal in France, Catalan and Basque in Spain, Cornish in England, Frisian in the Netherlands); certain “corporations”, notably the Church, possessed privileges which protected them against state interference; and many provinces possessed charters guaranteeing their traditional way of life.

Serious political upheavals occurred when the state tried to undermine these rights: the Dutch rebelled largely because they believed that the central government, controlled from Madrid, threatened their traditional liberties. They continued their armed opposition until 1609, when Spain, in effect, recognized the independence of the seven provinces still in rebellion. In England, Parliament began a civil war against Charles I in 1642 because it believed that he intended to destroy the established rights of “free-born Englishmen”. They, too, maintained their armed resistance until the power of the king was shattered in battle, and Charles himself was tried and executed in 1649. Although Charles’s son was restored in 1660 with full powers and even a small standing army, another revolt, in 1688, supported by the Dutch, drove James II into exile.

While opposition in France did not go to such lengths, the absolutist policies and fiscal exactions of Cardinal Mazarin, chief minister of the boy king Louis XIV, so alienated the crown’s officials, the nobles and the people of Paris that in 1649 they drove Louis from his capital and forced him to make major concessions. Royal control was not fully restored until 1655. Philip IV of Spain pushed the Portuguese aristocracy to revolt in support of the House of Braganza and by 1668 Portugal was independent. The Spanish king was fortunate not to lose Catalonia in a similar fashion during the revolt of 1640 to 1652.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE STATE
Despite these upheavals, however, the structure of the state survived. None of the rebels seriously questioned the need for strong government, only the location of it. After 1660, and even more after 1688, power in England was shared between Parliament, representing merchants and landowners, and the crown. The last major effort to resist the rise of central power and defend local autonomy had failed. In France, the Fronde was a frightening lesson for Louis XIV whose re-establishment of royal authority was based upon a policy of compromise with aristocratic and office-owning elites (see p. 196). A more sensitive government, combined with a rapidly expanding standing army after 1661, ensured that France saw no repetition of the Fronde before 1789.

The Dutch Revolt, on the other hand, achieved its primary goal of protecting local independence against central encroachment. Despite the preponderance of Holland within the Republic, the other six provinces retained a large measure of autonomy within a decentralized political system reminiscent of the 15th century. It was to leave the Dutch at a permanent disadvantage in a world which permitted no profit without power and no security without war. The 18th century and its profits—particularly in the colonial world—would belong to their rivals, France and Britain.

1494 TO 1797
THE MEDITERRANEAN WORLD
The Ottoman conquest of the eastern Mediterranean and the French invasion of Italy in 1494 opened a new phase in Mediterranean history. Both the sea and the Italian peninsula became the focus for power-struggles between states whose interests were only partly Mediterranean. Meanwhile, Europe’s economic centre of gravity shifted northwest.

After 1500, even as the civilization of the Italian Renaissance was spreading round Europe, Italy and the Mediterranean were losing their dominant position within the cultural and economic worlds of Europe. The invasion of Italy by Charles VIII of France in 1494 initiated over 60 years of warfare between the Habsburgs and the French Valois for control of Italy which undermined the political primacy of the Italian cities, just as the Ottoman drive into the eastern Mediterranean threatened their economic dominance. The loss of Italian primacy was precipitated in part, too, by the creation of the Habsburg empire. Charles V, elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, ruled not only the Habsburg lands in Austria, south Germany and the Netherlands, but also the realms bequeathed by his maternal grandparents, Ferdinand and Isabella, in Spain, Italy and north Africa. His inheritance was soon expanded: in 1526 his brother and close ally Ferdinand succeeded to the crowns of Bohemia and Hungary, creating a huge Habsburg power block running from the Adriatic almost to the Baltic. In 1535 Charles himself acquired both Milan and Tunis.

By the peace of Câteau-Cambrésis (1559), France was excluded from Italy, which now came under the domination of the Habsburgs. Although Charles V divided his empire on his death, his son Philip II of Spain retained Milan and the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily. Henceforth, Spanish viceroys ruled in Naples, Sicily and Sardinia, with a Spanish governor in Lombardy.

THE OTTOMAN THREAT
Even Italy’s largest states lacked room for manoeuvre in the face of Spain’s overwhelming dominance. 80 per cent of Genoese seaborne trade was conducted with Spain, and Venice, whose eastern Mediterranean empire was falling gradually into Ottoman hands, was surrounded by Habsburg territory. Papal attempts to oppose the Habsburgs ended in catastrophe: the sack of Rome itself in 1527 and a humiliating invasion in 1556–7. Yet the Spaniards at least provided effective defence against the Ottomans who, despite their successful advance along the north African coast with the capture of Algiers (1529), Tripoli (1551) and Bugia (1555), were unable to secure a foothold in Italy. The climactic moment came with the unsuccessful siege of Malta in 1565, although the Spanish victory at Lepanto (1571) could not prevent the fall of Cyprus the same year.

ITALY AND THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE
The fading of the Turkish threat after the Ottoman-Spanish truce of 1577 ensured that the new status quo lasted until the 1790s. Southern Italy and Sardinia were ruled by Spain, the Papal States dominated central Italy, while the north, apart from Venice, was still part of the Holy Roman Empire, and was a complex network of imperial and papal fiefs and semi-independent territories: in the 16th century, there were some 250–300 imperial fiefs held by 50–70 families, and some 296 papal fiefs with some 223,000 inhabitants. Although the last appearance of an Italian delegation to the Imperial Diet was in 1496, the duchy of Savoy was part of the Upper Rhenish Circle, and its dukes maintained a theoretical right to speak and vote in the Diet until 1806. Many important north Italian families, such as the Doria or the Spinola, were imperial princes, and the Imperial Aulic Council heard 1500 cases involving Italians between 1555 and 1806 (400 in the 16th century; 490 in the 17th; and 540 in the 18th). Northern Italy was strategically vital to Spain during the Dutch Revolt and the Thirty Years’ War: with the sea-route to the Netherlands through the English Channel dominated by the Dutch and the English, Milan was the mustering ground for Spanish troops sent overland down the “Spanish Road” through the Valtellina, Alsace and the Rhineland to the Netherlands. Thus Italy was vital to Spain’s long war against the Dutch rebels; this led to a renewal of Franco- Spanish war in Italy during the War of the Mantuan Succession (1629–31), which saw the victory of the French-backed candidate, Charles Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers.

Even when the Spanish Habsburgs died out in 1700, and the grandson of Louis XIV secured the Spanish throne as Philip V after the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–13), the status quo altered little. Austria acquired Milan, but only held Naples and Sicily between 1720 and 1735, when they reverted to a branch of the Spanish Bourbons after a series of territorial exchanges. Lesser principalities were similarly shared out. Only the republics of Venice, Genoa and Lucca remained relatively undisturbed.

BRITAIN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
The principal guardian of this stability was Great Britain, attracted to the Mediterranean by trading opportunities in the late 16th century, when the Levant Company established a base in Istanbul (1581). In the 1650s, British fleets entered to pursue royalist vessels and punish the Barbary pirates. From 1662 to 1683, Britain held Tangier, guarding the entrance to the Mediterranean; in 1704 it took Gibraltar on the other side of the straits. Sardinia was a British base between 1708 and 1714, as was Minorca from 1708 to 1783. On the whole, though, Britain preferred diplomacy to force; it was only when Napoleon’s invasion of Italy and annexation of Egypt and Malta in the late 1790s destroyed the status quo and convulsed the eastern and western Mediterranean alike that British naval power came to dominate both.

1523 TO 1721
THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC
The growing economic importance of the Baltic after 1500 coincided with the decay of the political status quo as the powers which had dominated the sea in the medieval period entered terminal decline or were seriously weakened. The resultant struggle for control of the Baltic Sea lasted two centuries before Russia emerged as the most significant Baltic power.

From 1500 the Baltic provided most of the timber, tar, pitch, hemp and flax for the ships with which European powers built their world empires, as well as copper and huge supplies of cheap grain. This increasingly lucrative trade provoked serious rivalry, as neighbouring powers sought to control ports at the mouths of the great rivers which bore goods from the interior, while Denmark’s control of both sides of the Sound, the narrow entrance to the Baltic, enabled it to impose the hotly contested Sound Tolls on most of the commerce passing through. After 1500, no power was strong enough to dominate the Baltic or its trade; the resultant conflicts constantly interlocked with wider European affairs.

In 1523 Sweden under Gustav Vasa broke away from the Scandinavian Union of Kalmar. Meanwhile, the Hanseatic League of Baltic trading towns began to unravel, while the Teutonic Order, which controlled the southern Baltic shore from Pomerania to Estonia, slowly decayed. A rebellion led by the burghers of Thorn, Danzig and Elbing in alliance with Poland had already seen the Order lose much of Prussia by the Peace of Thorn (1466); in 1525, Grand Master Albrecht of Hohenzollern then secularized the Order, creating the Duchy of Prussia as a Lutheran fief of the Polish crown. The decaying rump of the Order held on in Livonia, but ancient claims and a desire to profit from Baltic trade led Ivan IV of Muscovy to invade in 1558.

SWEDEN’S BALTIC EMPIRE
Ivan failed to establish Muscovite power on the Baltic. The early beneficiaries of the Order’s collapse were Poland-Lithuania and Sweden. Poland accepted the overlordship of Livonia in 1561 and granted Courland to Gotthard Kettler, Grand Master of the Order, as a fief of the Polish crown. Sweden, meanwhile, seized Reval and Estonia and became involved in the Nordic Seven Years’ War with Denmark (1563–70), in which Denmark struggled to re-establish the Union of Kalmar and Sweden sought to expand its foothold on the North Sea at Älvsborg, on the site of the future city of Gothenburg. The Muscovite armies could terrorize but not conquer; they were driven back by determined resistance from the Poles and the Swedes under John III (1568–92), who then married a Polish princess and had his son Sigismund elected king of Poland in 1587. Muscovy gradually subsided into anarchy after Ivan’s death in 1584; by 1619, it was cut off from the Baltic, as Sweden secured Karelia, Ingria (Ingermanland) and Estonia, and Poland-Lithuania took Livonia and regained Smolensk. Denmark, despite seizing Älvsborg in the War of Kalmar (1611–13), was unable to secure a decisive advantage, and had to remain content with control of The Sound, returning Älvsborg for a large ransom.

But the Polish-Swedish alliance was short-lived. Sigismund, raised a Catholic, was driven off the Swedish throne in 1599; for 60 years, Poland- Lithuania and Sweden were locked in a dynastic struggle which gave Muscovy time to recover.

Under the brilliant Gustavus Adolphus (1611–32) Sweden seized Livonia in the 1620s, while the powerful military system which matured in his reign enabled Sweden to play a leading role in the Thirty Years’ War (see p. 195) after his brilliant victory at Breitenfeld (Sep. 1631). By 1648, despite Gustavus Adolphus’s death in the battle of Lützen (Nov. 1632), Sweden had gained substantial territories in northern Germany and, after a devastating war with Denmark (1643–5), had widened its bridgehead on the North Sea.
Under Charles X (1654–60) Swedish power reached its zenith. Charles invaded Poland-Lithuania in 1655 and pushed the Muscovites back from Riga. Denmark, keen for revenge, attacked Sweden in 1657, but was defeated and made peace at Roskilde (Feb. 1658). Charles’s decision to attack Denmark again in the summer of 1658 proved rash, however: he lost the chance to secure concessions from Poland-Lithuania or Russia, while England, the United Provinces and France, fearing Swedish domination of the Baltic, supported Denmark. After the Peace of Copenhagen (1660), though Denmark’s grip on the Sound was broken, Sweden had failed to find security.

THE DECLINE OF SWEDISH POWER
Sweden’s success brought it many enemies. Swedish support of the house of Holstein-Gottorp, a junior branch of the Danish royal family which shared control of the duchy of Holstein, ensured that relations with Denmark remained tense. Attacked by Brandenburg and Denmark in the Scanian War (1676–9), Sweden’s precarious control of its scattered Baltic empire was revealed: it only preserved its southern Baltic holdings thanks to the intervention of Louis XIV of France.

Charles XI (1660–97) adopted a pacific policy after 1679 and revived the army, but when he was succeeded by his teenage son Charles XII (1697–1718), Denmark, Saxony-Poland and Russia formed an alliance which attacked Sweden in 1700, launching the Great Northern War (1700–21). Although Charles immediately knocked Denmark out of the war, smashed the Russian army at Narva (1700) and forced Saxony to make peace at Altranstädt (1706), he became bogged down in Poland. Peter I, given breathing-space after Narva, built a formidable army and fleet; by 1704, Ingermanland and much of Livonia was in his hands. After Charles’s crushing defeat at Poltava (1709), Brandenburg-Prussia, Hanover and Denmark joined Russia in a struggle for Sweden’s Baltic empire. By 1721, Sweden was once more a second-rank power, and Russia was the dominant force in the region.

1493 TO 1806
THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE
The Holy Roman Empire was a decentralized confederal system. While undoubtedly complex, it was effective enough to maintain a common currency and robust enough to survive religious division and the Thirty Years’ War. After 1648, its institutions revived and it was regarded as the natural political framework for Germany until, undermined from outside, it collapsed in 1806.

At first sight, the Holy Roman Empire appears incoherent, with a high degree of political fragmentation and competing jurisdictions. In fact, considerable institutional consolidation took place after 1493 within what was a confederal system, with varying levels of authority which kept political control close to those affected by it. The Empire’s division into ten “Circles” improved its administration, with the Circles organizing taxation, regulating disputes and supervising the common currency, the Imperial thaler. The revival of the Imperial Cameral Tribunal and the Imperial Diet and the introduction of a common criminal code provided the empire with a complex but not unworkable constitution. From the election of Maximilian I (1493), the position of emperor became all but hereditary in the Habsburg dynasty, with a brief interlude in the reign of the Wittelsbach Charles VII (1742–5) during the War of the Austrian Succession.

THE WARS OF RELIGION
After 1517 two factors put the Empire under immense strain: the Reformation and the dramatic increase in Habsburg power following the election of Charles V (1519). Religion became a central issue, as princes sought to limit the Emperor’s power while the secularization of Church property in much of northern and western Germany sparked bitter disputes. Although the formation of the Protestant Schmalkaldic League in the 1530s brought a series of brief civil wars, all sides recoiled from all-out confrontation. At the peace of Augsburg (1555), a compromise was reached based on the principle that princes should determine the religion of their subjects.

Augsburg kept the peace for 60 years, but bitter disputes arose over its interpretation. Further instability was caused by conflict between the Habsburgs and their Austrian and Bohemian subjects, who by 1600 were largely Protestant. In 1618, the Bohemians rebelled, deposing Ferdinand II as their king in 1619. The rebels were defeated, but the war spread into the Empire after 1620. The Thirty Years’ War devastated the empire, reducing a population in 1618 of between 20 and 25 million by a third.

The Peace of Westphalia (1648), which ended it, brought religious compromise and established a new political framework. The power of the Emperor and the princes was better defined, and the Diet sat in permanent session at Regensburg from 1663; the way was opened for political and economic recovery. Nevertheless, Westphalia brought new problems. The more powerful princes soon created standing armies and played a more prominent role in European relations. The electors of Brandenburg built a new power-base in Prussia, while in 1697 the elector of Saxony turned Catholic to secure election to the Polish throne as Augustus II. In 1714, the elector of Hanover became king of England as George I.

ECONOMIC GROWTH
Despite its problems, most Germans still saw the empire as their natural political framework, and the 18th century saw economic expansion in many areas, particularly Silesia, where major landowners combined with government to invest in mining, iron and textiles, and the lower Rhineland and Saxony, which was probably the most advanced of all. But farming remained dominant, with three-quarters of Germany’s population still rural in 1815, and towns and cities small compared with those of England and France: Berlin’s 140,000 inhabitants in 1777 compared with 260,000 in Vienna, 670,000 in Paris and over 850,000 in London. Nevertheless, this reflected the empire’s decentralized constitution, and in cities such as Weimar, Karlsruhe, Mannheim and Stuttgart attempts were made to implement Enlightenment ideas in ambitious reform programmes, often strikingly successful precisely because the principalities were so small. Germany experienced a literary revival in which Goethe and Schiller were figures of international significance. Yet with the import of French revolutionary ideas after 1789, the empire’s institutions proved incapable of absorbing new ideas or adjusting to meet the challenge of Napoleon. In 1806, Francis II’s abdication as Holy Roman Emperor ended a line which had begun 850 years earlier.

1648 TO 1715
THE ASCENDANCY OF FRANCE
Louis XIV’s France was the most powerful state in Europe. By 1680 the king was acclaimed as “Louis the Great” and military victories were matched by a flowering of the arts and economic and colonial expansion. Yet French success pushed the other great powers, England, the Dutch Republic and the Austrian Habsburgs, into a coalition which, by 1709, had brought France close to invasion and defeat.

During the reign of Louis XIV France became so powerful that other states feared her ascendancy, regarding her as a danger to the balance of power on the Continent. Louis was suspected of plans to oust the Austrian Habsburgs from their traditional position as elected Holy Roman Emperor and of spearheading a second Catholic counter-reformation. He was generally held to be seeking French hegemony in Europe.

Such fears rested upon solid ground. After a century of foreign war and internal strife, Louis XIV and his able ministers took advantage of the peaceful years between 1659 and 1672 to make great progress in manufacturing, in trade, in overseas expansion and in ship-building. At the same time the French army was greatly expanded. The richness of French resources, including a population estimated at 20 million (Great Britain, in comparison, had a population of less than 8 million), played a significant part in these developments, but so did conscious effort and directives from the centre.

TERRITORIAL CONSOLIDATION
Louis’ objectives were at first quite limited and concerned the security of France’s frontiers. Habsburg encirclement, forged by the family compacts of the Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs, was still felt to be pressing round France though the Peace of Westphalia (1648) brought sovereignty over Metz, Toul and Verdun and possession of the landgravates of Upper and Lower Alsace. The Peace of the Pyrenees (1659) plugged the gap in the southern frontier with Spain ceding Roussillon and northern Cerdagne. Yet France was still vulnerable from the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté as well as through Lorraine and the Belfort Gap. This helps to explain the two aggressive wars of Louis’ reign: the War of Devolution, fought to lay claim to part of the Spanish Netherlands in 1667–8; and the attack on the Dutch Republic in 1672. The latter, much to Louis’ discomfiture, escalated into a European-wide war not settled until 1678–9.

FAMINE AND WAR
Louis tried to avoid large-scale war after 1679 by resort to arbitration and treaties to settle European problems, but the memories of his early wars and the enormous power of France made the rest of Europe suspicious. He caused further unease by his “reunion” policy to expand his control of German border areas and he lost the sympathy of all Protestant powers for his persecution of the Huguenots. The deleterious economic effects of the exodus of over 200,000 French Calvinists in the 1670s and 1680s have been greatly exaggerated, but the international consequences of Louis’ revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) were far-reaching, and contributed to the outbreak of the Nine Years’ War (1688–97) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14).

The defensive element in Louis’ foreign policy is still disputed among historians, but can be demonstrated by the construction of a barrière de fer of fortresses around the whole of France and by his willingness to promote a peaceful partition of the Spanish empire before the death of Carlos II. When that policy failed and the dying Spanish king offered the crown to his grandson, the future Philip V, Louis had no alternative but to accept. While understandable, it was a fateful decision for his subjects. Over a million had starved during the terrible famine of 1693–4 and nearly as many would perish as war combined with natural disaster to exact a terrible toll.

CULTURAL ASCENDANCY
French ascendancy between 1648 and 1715 was not apparent only in the fields of politics, diplomacy and war. Louis’ work for French architecture, learning, and for science and the arts in general, and his pensions paid to a great number of European poets, artists and scholars, whether they studied in France or not, may seem more important than his wars. His court at Versailles and his support for academies became models for other princes. French became the language of the educated classes all over Europe and helped to create the the country’s cosmopolitan civilization of the late 17th and the early 18th centuries. France also made progress during his reign in the number of colleges and hospitals; in the codification of laws; in administrative practices and efficiencies; and in a range of practical improvements from street lighting and policing in Paris to the digging of the Canal Royal (completed by 1684), which provided cheap and efficient communication between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Taken as a whole, the reign fixed the French frontiers in Europe (though colonial cessions had to be made to Great Britain) and in the history of French civilization, the period is deservedly honoured with the title Le Grand Siècle.

1713 TO 1815
THE STRUGGLE FOR EMPIRE
From 1713 until 1815 Great Britain and France fought for global supremacy in India, North America and the Caribbean. Britain, with her great naval strength, was always at an advantage because France was first and foremost a continental power. Control of the seas allowed the British to defeat her enemy in North America and India.

European territorial expansion overseas continued throughout the 18th century and led to serious clashes between Portugal and Spain in the Banda Oriental (Uruguay), between Spain and Great Britain in Georgia and between Great Britain and France elsewhere in North America. Trading monopolies proved an even greater source of friction. Spanish attempts to suppress British and Dutch smugglers reduced the Caribbean to a state of undeclared war. Further north, British efforts to enforce similar restrictions upon its American colonists provoked resistance and finally, from 1775, open revolt.

THE ANGLO-FRENCH STRUGGLE
During 1739–40 the fragile peace brought about by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 collapsed as Great Britain and Spain went to war in defence of their trading rights, while Frederick the Great’s invasion of Silesia began the struggle for supremacy in eastern Europe (see p. 201). The outbreak of hostilities between Great Britain and France in 1744 brought the colonial conflict and the war for Silesia together into a single conflict that extended from North America to India and from the West Indies to Russia. This struggle, which lasted intermittently until 1815, rapidly became a duel between Great Britain and France for global supremacy. European states, American settlers, Native American chiefs and Indian princes all fought as subsidized and dependent allies of these two great powers.

CONFLICT IN NORTH AMERICA
The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) settled none of the outstanding questions, and fighting began again in North America in 1754. France quickly achieved local military superiority with its strategically sited forts preventing further British expansion. The outbreak of the Seven Years’ War in Europe (1756–63) transformed the situation. France was handicapped by its continental commitments and Britain took control of the Atlantic, decisively defeating the French fleet at Quiberon Bay and Lagos in 1759. With French forces in Canada cut off from reinforcements Louisbourg fell in 1758, Quebec in 1759 and Montreal in 1760.

The British triumph was short-lived. Between 1763 and the American War of Independence (1776–83: see p. 208), France rebuilt both its navy and its alliances in pursuit of revenge. By 1781, confronted in home waters by a hostile coalition of France, Spain and the Dutch Republic and overstrained by the need to defend an empire stretching from Canada to India, Great Britain was forced to surrender control of North American waters. The French blockade of Yorktown forced a major British army to surrender, and in 1783 Great Britain was obliged to recognize American independence.

RIVALRY IN INDIA
During these same years the British founded a new empire in India. The emergence of independent princes from the ruins of the Mughal empire in the early 18th century gave the English and the French East India companies opportunities to intervene in local politics. Here again sea power was decisive. Thus, after early French successes, Great Britain’s ability to reinforce its position by sea enabled it to check France’s ambitious designs in the Carnatic. But the real foundation of the British empire in India followed Clive’s victory at Plassey (1757) which gave the British control of the rich province of Bengal. Reinforcements from Bengal enabled the British to eliminate French influence in the Carnatic and become the predominant European power in India.

The French revolution of 1789 shattered the French navy and left British naval power preeminent. This ruined Napoleon’s plans for the invasion of Great Britain. By 1815, the French, Spanish, Dutch and Danish fleets were defeated, their colonies mostly in British hands. With the acquisition of the Cape, Ceylon and Mauritius, Great Britain secured the route to India, and laid the foundations for the second British empire.

1648 TO 1795
THE AGE OF PARTITION: EASTERN EUROPE
After 1648, a new balance of power in eastern Europe was brought about by the decline of both Poland-Lithuania and the Ottoman empire. Turkish resilience preserved the Ottoman empire from collapse, but Poland’s internal weakness was cynically exploited by its neighbours to block reform and to destroy and partition the state.

Poland’s failure to crush the revolt of the Zaporozhian Cossacks after 1648 opened a new chapter in east European history. Poland-Lithuania was torn by foreign invasion in the Second Northern War (1655–60) and although it recovered it could not prevent the loss of Kiev and the left-bank Ukraine to Muscovy at the treaty of Andrusovo (1667) or rebuild its military system, with the result that the Ukraine remained a battleground for Poland, Russia and the Ottomans. The Cossacks divided into pro-Polish, pro-Russian and pro-Ottoman factions in the period known in Ukraine as “the Ruin”.

OTTOMAN REVIVAL AND DECLINE
The renewed opportunities in Ukraine tempted the Ottoman empire, which pursued an expansionist policy under a succession of Grand Viziers from the Köprülü family. It reconquered Tenedos and Lemnos from Venice (1657) and seized Crete (1669). At the peace of Buczacz (1672) Podolia was then taken from Poland, before Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa led a huge army to besiege Vienna (1683). A combined Imperial and Polish army led by King John III Sobieski of Poland-Lithuania (1674–96) drove the Ottomans from the city wall. Thereafter the establishment in 1684 of the Holy League of Venice, Austria and Poland- Lithuania, supported by the Papacy, marked the start of a long campaign to push the Ottomans back. In 1686 Russia, too, joined the alliance.

The Ottomans could not combat the new military sophistication of European armies. At the peace of Carlowitz (1699), Podolia was returned to Poland, and Austrian possession of Hungary was confirmed. Yet division and distractions among the allies ensured that until 1739 the Ottoman empire, far from collapsing, was able to reverse some of its defeats. Azov, seized by Russia in 1696, was returned in 1711 after Peter I’s army was surrounded on the river Prut, while Serbia and parts of Wallachia, ceded to Austria at Passarowitz in 1718, were regained in 1739 at the Peace of Belgrade. It was only after 1770 that Russian expansion to the Black Sea and the Caucasus was triumphantly resumed. Nonetheless Ottoman resilience was still enough to ensure that retreat was gradual. Only after 1815 did the balance tip decisively against the Ottomans and their final decline begin.

Sobieski’s triumph at Vienna, however, marked the Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania’s last major victory as a significant European power, as the political problems which increasingly paralysed its institutions became clear to its neighbours. The Commonwealth’s diet (the Sejm) was composed of delegates from provincial dietines (sejmiki). Decisions were consensual; in 1652, this saw the first acceptance of the liberum veto, by which a sole delegate had the right to block Sejm decisions. Henceforth, Sejm sessions regularly broke up without deciding anything, including the levying of taxes with which to pay the army.

THE PARTITIONS OF POLAND
The first plans to partition Poland-Lithuania were drawn up in 1656–7, but after 1660 its neighbours recognized that there were advantages to be drawn from preserving it politically divided and weak. The liberum veto proved the perfect instrument: deputies could always be bribed to break the Sejm. Hopes of revival after the election of King Augustus II, elector of Saxony, (1697–1733) were dashed during the Great Northern War (1700–21), when Peter I’s political acumen enabled him to establish a virtual Russian protectorate over the Commonwealth from 1717, when its army was limited to 24,000, tiny by 18th-century standards.

This situation suited Austria and Prussia, fighting for control of Silesia after the Prussian invasion of 1740. The War of Austrian Succession (1740–8) and the Seven Years’ War (1756–63) left Prussia with Silesia; the two powers soon found common ground in the east where the election of Stanislaw Poniatowski as king of Poland in 1764 heralded the breakdown of the Russian protectorate over Poland as Poniatowski, inspired by Enlightenment teaching, sought to reform the unworkable Polish constitution. This provoked dangerous opposition: after the anti-Russian Confederation of Bar (1768–72) reduced the Commonwealth to political anarchy, Austria’s seizure of the small territory of Zips (Spiz) stimulated Prussia and Russia to join in the First Partition.

Taking advantage of Russian distraction in the Turkish war of 1788–92 Poniatowski summoned the Four-Year Sejm (1788–92) which passed the Constitution of 3rd May 1791. This abolished the liberum veto and radically restructured the Commonwealth. The prospect of a revived Poland was too much for Russia and Prussia, who in 1793 agreed the Second Partition, in which Prussia secured Danzig. When the following year Tadeusz Kosciuszko led a rising in protest, Russia, Austria and Prussia combined to wipe Poland-Lithuania from the map in the Third Partition.

c. 1775
THE EMERGING GLOBAL ECONOMY
During the 18th century international trade made rapid strides, fuelled by the demand for luxury goods and foodstuffs from a Europe growing in wealth. The core of the trading system was the Atlantic triangle, dominated by Britain and France, which was based on the sale of slaves from Africa and the export of sugar and tobacco from the New World.

During the course of the 18th century, European and American merchants developed an extensive system of intercontinental trade routes which laid the foundation for the evolution of a sophisticated global economy in the next century. Trade on such a scale encouraged the development of large ocean-going merchant fleets, and the gradual development of modern commercial practices, particularly in the supply of insurance and trade credits. Nonetheless most trade in Europe and in the rest of the world remained local. In 1800 extra-European trade contributed an estimated 4 per cent to Europe’s aggregate gross national product.

MERCANTILISM
For much of the century trade was still governed by mercantilist principles: trade should always be in surplus to provide a stream of bullion, and trade was always a war between states for a fixed quantity of commerce. In reality European merchants could see that trade was growing rapidly over the century, and bullion increasingly being replaced by bills of exchange. Nevertheless states still played an important part in inhibiting trade by pursuing mercantilist policies. British tariffs rose sharply over the 18th century, averaging 30 per cent, while British colonies were banned from producing industrial products that competed with domestic manufactures. Britain’s Navigation Acts prevented any other power from engaging in trade in Britain’s empire. Bullion was also essential for western European trade with the Baltic, Turkey and Asia, which supplied goods much in demand in Europe but had little market for European products.

There were other factors that made trade difficult. Piracy was widespread, and not until the defeat of the Mediterranean corsairs after 1815 and the elimination of Caribbean pirates by 1830 was trade in these seas secure. Piracy remained endemic in the Indian Ocean and the China Sea. War also interrupted trade development, for states permitted official piracy in time of war. Trade security could only be guaranteed by those states that possessed large navies, which meant that Britain, France and the Netherlands profited most from the growth of world commerce.

THE SLAVE ECONOMY
Trade growth owed a great deal to the emergence of the Atlantic economy, where most trans-oceanic trade was conducted. Much of this was based on the Spanish and Portuguese empires which still played an important part in the 18th century, chiefly through the mining of gold and silver and its shipment exclusively to the Iberian peninsula. But the growth of the American colonies, the Caribbean and Canada promoted a new trade. The most important commodity was slaves, and more than 8 million Africans were shipped to the New World between the 17th and 19th centuries. Although outlawed by the United States and Britain in 1807, the slave trade continued until the 1860s.

The rise of the Atlantic slave economy was based on the growing demand in Europe for tobacco, sugar and cotton, all of which were produced in plantations in the New World. British trade in sugar grew six-fold over the 18th century, and the supply of tobacco, much of which was re-exported to Europe, grew from 14,500,000kg (32,000,000lb) to 22,700,000kg (50,000,000lb). Europeans brought manufactured goods to the west African coast to trade for slaves which were then taken to the New World and sold. Plantation products were then exported to Europe. Half of the slaves died before shipping, perhaps a quarter more on board ship, another fifth in the first year of work. It was a brutal and inefficient trade, but it kept Europe supplied with cheap luxury products which it could not afford from Asia.

TRADE WITH ASIA
Trade with the rest of the world was small. Asian and African traders kept to inland routes, or engaged in coastal trade. Europeans bought silk, spices, coffee and china, but often paid with gold or silver. Trade was conducted through local chartered companies such as the East India Company, which enjoyed a monopoly of Britain’s south Asia trade until 1813. The consolidation of British power in Bengal opened the way in the late 1700s to the opening up of Asian trade. In 1700 Britain imported 32,000kg (70,000lb) of teas; by 1800 the figure had risen to 6,800,000kg (15,000,000lb). The development of Britain’s cotton textile industry in the last third of the century produced a trading revolution. By then, the rapid pace of industrialization was poised to open the way for the domination of world markets by European traders in the 19th century and the development of a global system of communication, finance and production.

1760 TO 1820
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGINS: GREAT BRITAIN
During the 18th century, Britain experienced the world’s first industrial revolution as new technologies and overseas markets developed. British industry began to meet a growing demand for cheap consumer goods. It was a revolution that ushered in the mass market and paved the way for the economic transformation of the globe.

During the second half of the 18th century, the British economy was slowly transformed by the development of new industrial technologies that permitted cheaper production on a larger scale to meet the demands of a growing mass market. In fact the term “industrial revolution” is misleading. The British economy had been growing steadily since the late 17th century, while much of the success of the new industries depended on changes in agriculture, transport and financial services and on the accelerated growth of the population. Nonetheless, at the heart of Britain’s late 18th-century industrial transformation lay changes in the production of iron, textiles and machinery and a shift from wood to coal as the primary source of energy.

THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES
The key lay in steam power. Steam engines had existed since the beginning of the century, but when the Scottish scientist James Watt developed a more reliable and powerful version in the 1760s it was rapidly applied in mining, then in the iron industry. The invention of a rotative motion engine in 1781 opened the way for steam power to drive machinery. By 1800 the cotton and brewing industries were regular users of steam power. When Watt’s patents lapsed in 1800, steam power spread throughout the industrial economy and the transport system. In 1825 the first steam railway was opened, ushering in another new period of economic development.

Innovation was also important in manufacturing. In the cotton textile industry, production was slowly mechanized from the 1760s to the 1790s, though hand-loom weaving was not challenged by machines until the 1820s. Mechanization permitted the shift from small-scale craft output to factory production: by 1816, for example, Arkwright’s mill at Cromford in northwest England employed over 700 people. In the iron industry the inventions of Henry Cort in 1784 permitted coal to be used as the main refpining fuel for iron, while the steam engine was used to produce rolled and bar-iron for working. Large production units developed which both smelted the ore and produced the finished iron products. Better quality iron could be used in all forms of construction work. Innovation became a continuous process, producing a stream of cheaper and better products.

THE CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH
Britain was by no means the only country to produce industrial inventions, but it enjoyed a number of advantages which explain its rapid industrial development. In the first place agriculture experienced its own “revolution”, making it more prosperous and more productive. Improvements in patterns of land cultivation, greater use of fertilizers and improved stock breeding all contributed to raising farm incomes. The enclosure of common land accelerated after 1760 with Parliamentary Enclosure Acts, and had the effect of creating large integrated farms where modern practices could be introduced and yields and incomes raised. Farming generated growing demand for industrial goods and encouraged the creation of a wider market for farm products.

Agrarian change also encouraged the development of better transport and a more sophisticated capital market to meet the costs of farm improvement and canal-building. Both helped the emergence of early industry. Many businessmen came from humble social backgrounds with little access to finance. Landlord and merchant capital, derived largely from Britain’s prosperous overseas and colonial trade, was mobilized for investment in expanding industries and in the building of canals, roads, ports and, from 1825, railways. The rapid growth of a largely unregulated capital market brought a serious bank crisis in 1825 which prompted bank reform in 1826 and, in 1844, the creation of a central bank and clearing-bank system. Without the emergence of this modern credit structure, the pace of industrial change might well have been much slower.

THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION
By 1820 Britain was in the throes of rapid social and economic transformation. Population growth produced a flow of cheap labour to the new cities and provided a large new market for mass-produced consumer goods. There were few social barriers to labour mobility or a business career, while governments favoured legislation that encouraged economic growth. It was between 1820 and 1851, when Britain hosted the Great Exhibition to trumpet its economic triumphs, that the industrialization of Britain finally overturned the agrarian social structure and traditional landlord rule. The new business class became an important political force, while the new urban workforce, toiling in appalling conditions with little security, laid the foundations for organized labour protest. “Class” in its modern sense was the direct offspring of industrial change.

1773 TO 1814
THE AGE OF REVOLT
A wave of revolutions swept over Europe and the Americas in the late 18th century, inspired in part by ideas of freedom promoted in the Enlightenment. New social forces challenged the old royal regimes and traditional privileges. Revolutions in France and America symbolized the struggle against despotism and the triumph of a new ideal of citizenship.

In the Social Contract (1762), the French philosopher Rousseau claimed “Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains”. He was writing at the height of the European Enlightenment, an intellectual revolt against tradition and superstition. The spirit of the Enlightenment was the emancipation of the individual and the rational organization of society. Both ideas had deep political implications. Over the next 30 years much of the political order of Europe and America was overturned by revolutionaries who drew inspiration from the idea of political liberty and civil rights embodied in Enlightenment political philosophy.

The pattern of revolt was unpredictable and diverse. It owed something to early stirrings of nationalism, evident in Corsica, Poland and Ireland. But the chief revolutions in the American colonies and in France were responses to royal authority which came to be regarded as arbitrary, inefficient and unjust. In 1775 Britain’s American colonies rebelled against the existing tax regime and under George Washington fought a six-year war against British-led forces, finally winning independence in 1783. The “founding fathers” of American liberty established a modern constitutional republic based on ideas on human rights culled from Enlightenment Europe.

THE SPREAD OF REVOLUTION
The American revolution had a great impact in Europe and many of those involved in it subsequently played a part in the many European revolts. Benjamin Franklin was an important influence in France, while the Polish nationalist Tadeusz Kosciuszko, who fought in the American revolution, returned to lead the Polish revolt against the two powers—Russia and Prussia—which had partitioned Poland in 1792. The revolution in Poland was typical of the popular reaction to the ideal of liberty and independence expressed in the newly-created USA. In the spring of 1794 thousands of Poles, drawn mainly from the educated and gentry classes, under the military leadership of Kosciuszko, drove the Russian army from Warsaw. Many of those involved were “Jacobins” who modelled themselves on the more radical social reformers and democrats of the French Revolution. The Polish revolution was destroyed by Russian and Prussian forces late in 1794. Attempts to spread the revolution further into eastern Europe failed. Small groups of Jacobins in Budapest were organized by Ignaz Martinovics in 1794 to imitate the Polish revolt, but the leaders were arrested and imprisoned. Only in the Netherlands and northern Italy did the revolutionary example have greater success, not only because ideas of “democracy” were more widely understood and broadcast, but because revolutionary groups there enjoyed the protection of the French.


The French example inspired hope of liberty around the world. In India Tipu Sultan planted a symbolic “Tree of Liberty” and declared himself an ally of revolutionary France against the British. In Haiti a slave revolt in 1791 freed the island from colonial rule. In Latin America the growing local hostility to Spanish rule was fuelled by news of the French revolution. Jacobin conspirators were discovered by the authorities in Quito and Buenos Aires. In Bogotá in 1793, 100 copies of the Rights of Man were printed, copied from the French declaration of 1789. In eastern Europe Jacobin activity was stamped out in Vienna and Budapest, while the 1794 Polish revolt, though led by the Polish nobility, used the French cry of “liberty and equality” against its Russian and Prussian oppressors.

The wave of political revolt produced a strong counter - revolutionary reaction. Many of the revolutionaries in America and France were themselves conservative in outlook and worked to eliminate more radical or utopian revolutionary movements. Slave revolts in America were brutally suppressed in the 1790s. The revolutionary Directory unleashed a “white terror” against the Jacobins in France, and Napoleon restored a strong centralist and authoritarian state after 1800. In eastern and central Europe reform introduced by so-called Enlightened despots was reversed or suspended and revolt in Poland, Hungary, Bohemia and the Ukraine violently quashed. Though Britain possessed the most liberal political system, the regime stamped hard on Irish nationalism and on any domestic threat of republicanism or domestic agitation.

In 1815 the Vienna Congress, summoned after the defeat of Napoleon, restored much of pre-1789 Europe by adopting the principle of “legitimism”. But although monarchy was returned in France, the new ideas of liberty and nationhood were to find fertile ground throughout Europe and the Americas over the following century.

1789 TO 1797
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
In the summer of 1789 the most powerful monarchy in Europe was overthrown by a popular revolution in favour of constitutional rule. There followed ten years of political turmoil as moderate parliamentarians and radical republicans fought over the political future of France. The many different ideals represented by the revolution were impossible to reconcile, and in 1799 a new era of authoritarian rule began under the dashing revolutionary general, Napoleon Bonaparte.

The French Revolution had many causes, some long-term, some more immediate. For 30 years there had been growing peasant hostility to rising rents and declining common rights as gentry and bourgeois landowners tried to cope with inflation and falling incomes by tightening the screw. For much of the century France was the hub of new ideas about liberty, citizenship and patriotism, and a powerful intellectual demolition of royal authority and clerical influence. By the 1780s the language of liberty had permeated much of the educated elite, gentry and bourgeois, and had filtered down into popular politics. Craftsmen and shopkeepers came to articulate their social and economic grievances in terms of civil rights and economic justice.

The actual events that came to be known as the French Revolution were precipitated by a crisis of state. For much of the century the monarchy had increased levels of central control and fiscal demands, undermining local privilege and raising taxes. The moral authority of the old order was eroded by the rising tide of political criticism and the spread of scurrilous libels of the monarchy and court life. Faced with severe financial crisis, failure in war and poor harvests, Louis XVI tried to stave off criticism by calling the Estates General. This assembly, representing the clergy (known as the First Estate), the gentry (Second Estate) and commoners (Third Estate), had not been summoned since 1614. However, in the summer of 1789 a group of deputies representing the Third Estate (the overwhelming majority of Frenchmen) declared themselves to be a National Assembly and overturned centuries of royal absolutism. On 14 July the royal prison at the Bastille was stormed. In August feudal privilege was abolished throughout France, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which promised individual liberty in place of royal despotism, was published. Louis was forced to accept a parliamentary constitution and the abolition of much of the structure of privilege that sustained the monarchy and the aristocratic elite.

FROM REFORM TO TERROR
A new constitution, finally accepted by the king in September 1791, established a constitutional, parliamentary monarchy. The Catholic Church lost many of its privileges, and priests were compelled in November 1790 to swear allegiance to the new order. Thousands refused, and were forced from office, or led local resistance to the Paris-based revolutionary regime in Brittany and large parts of southern France. The revolutionary assembly also reformed local administration into “departments” in 1791, and began a programme of legal reform and land redistribution.

The revolutionary leadership was never unitary. Divisions emerged over the utopian ideals of some revolutionaries, who wanted to create a new social and moral order and develop a “new man” on the enlightenment model. The more moderate Girondin faction launched a revolutionary war in April 1792 against Austria and other counter-revolutionary forces. The ensuing economic crisis, the rhetoric of patriotic mobilization and fear of conspiracy in France, produced a radical transformation of French politics. Under the leadership of the Jacobin faction, any pretence at representative government vanished. The constitutional monarchy was abolished in September 1792 and a republic declared. A Committee of Public Safety was set up in April 1793, and a little later a Committee of General Security, which launched a nationwide hunt for traitors to the revolution. Thousands of nobles, clergymen, merchants, as well as numbers of peasants and workers, were executed in 1793 and 1794 on the strength of often trumped-up charges. Growing popular revulsion against terrorism led to the execution in July 1794 of leading Jacobins, including their chief spokesman, Maximilien Robespierre. A reaction against the utopianism of the revolutionary elite produced a more moderate revolutionary Directorate in November 1795, which savagely crushed radical political circles while consolidating the reforms of the revolution.

THE LEGACY OF THE REVOLUTION
The French Revolution failed to turn France into a democratic state, and the civil rights enshrined in its opening declaration were subject to constant abuse; but the programme of legal, administrative and educational reform was enduring. The revolution provided an inspiration to political opposition, and the symbols of the new French order were widely imitated. The French parliamentary system established in 1791 gave rise to new political terms: left and right (derived from the physical make-up of the new French assembly building) came to define the battle-lines of European politics, while the term communism was coined by popular radicals in the mid-1790s. For conservatives, the revolution represented for decades to come the unbridled political appetites of the mob.

1799 TO 1815
NAPOLEON AND THE RESHAPING OF EUROPE
Between 1799 and 1815 Napoleon blazed across Europe, plunging the continent into near permanent war and ruthlessly imposing on it French revolutionary institutions and his own tirelessly cultivated image as a latter-day Julius Caesar. Though he was ultimately defeated and exiled, the world of the ancien régime was swept aside for ever.

Napoleon, born in 1769 to minor gentry in Corsica, was barely 30 years old when, in November 1799, he became First Consul and de facto ruler of the French First Republic. He had made his name as a revolutionary general in northern Italy in 1796–7, where his defeat of Austria allowed him to create a new state, the Cisalpine Republic, run on French lines by pro-French Italian notables, a pattern reproduced throughout the areas later conquered by him.

Though Napoleon as First Consul inherited a system with an element of popular participation, within three years the revolution’s democratic aspirations had been smothered and France had been ruthlessly centralized. This concentration of power in his own hands reached its logical conclusion in 1804 with the creation of a French empire over which Napoleon presided as self-appointed emperor.

THE PRIMACY OF THE MILITARY
Napoleon’s centralization of power took many forms—notably the Code Napoléon of 1804 which, in codifying and rationalizing French law, swept away ancien régime privilege and increased the power of the French state; the agreement with the Pope in 1802, which ended the dispute for primacy between state and church, again very much in the former’s favour; and the creation of a paramilitary police force, the gendarmerie, which mercilessly suppressed opposition to the revolution. But its overriding characteristic was the mobilization of France on an unprecedented scale in support of the army. With more than 1.5 million Frenchmen under arms, the French economy came to be dominated by the needs of the military.

This was not yet “total war”, but the demands of more than 20 years of conflict turned the Napoleonic empire into a militarized society. The military priorities explain the long string of military triumphs. In 1800 Italy was reconquered and French power extended in Germany. In 1805 Russia and Austria were defeated at Austerlitz and in 1806 Prussia humiliated at Jena. At Eylau in 1807 Russia was again defeated. Under the terms of the subsequent Treaty of Tilsit, French power was extended as far as Poland, where Napoleon established yet another puppet regime, the Grand Duchy of Warsaw.

Napoleon appointed kings, princes and dukes to enforce French rule throughout his empire. In the Kingdom of Westphalia he installed his youngest brother, Jerome. In Naples his brother Joseph was made king. When Joseph was transferred to Spain as its monarch in 1808, Naples was placed under the rule of Napoleon’s brother-in-law, Joachim Murat. Holland was ruled by another brother, Louis, from 1806 to 1810. In all these areas, French officials introduced conscription and new taxes, helping finance the almost permanent state of war Napoleon faced.

By 1807 only Britain, at war with France almost continuously since 1792, remained undefeated. Britain’s chief weapon was its navy, largely unchallenged by Napoleon after its defeat of the combined French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar in 1805. But unable to defeat Napoleon on land, Britain then blockaded French ports. Napoleon responded by forbidding trade with Britain in any of the territories of his empire. But though this, the Continental System, brought hardship to Britain, its effects on France were hardly less severe. The political crisis that followed was made all the more serious when in 1809 Spain revolted against French rule. The “Spanish Ulcer” drained France of 70 million francs a year. In 1810, Tsar Alexander refused to exclude British trade. In June 1812 Napoleon invaded Russia.

DEFEAT AND EXILE
It was a fatal miscalculation. With widespread unrest against French rule in much of northern Europe as well as in Spain, Napoleon had over-reached himself. As his troops retreated from Moscow, ravaged by hunger, disease and cold, they were harried relentlessly by the Russians. About 450,000 began the campaign; only 40,000 survived.

The cost broke the empire. Steep tax rises and conscription caused bitter popular protest. At the same time, Napoleon’s enemies, realizing that he could after all be defeated, reformed the coalition against him. At Leipzig in October 1813, the French army was overwhelmed. The following year Napoleon was exiled and the Bourbon monarchy restored. Though Napoleon contrived a final throw, escaping from exile in 1815 and regrouping his army, this time his defeat, at Waterloo, was decisive and he was exiled to St Helena in the South Atlantic, where in 1821 he died.

The treaty drawn up by the Great Powers to decide the fate of Napoleon’s empire—the Vienna Settlement of 1815—aimed not just to overthrow his legacy but to make any further revolutionary upsurge impossible. In the longer term, it failed. Napoleon’s reforms had shaken Europe’s traditional structures to their foundations, creating the conditions for the emergence of recognizably modern states across Europe.

SIX
 
THE AGE OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE
Between 1815 and 1914 Europe thrust out into the world, impelled by the force of its own industrialization. Millions of Europeans poured overseas and into Asiatic Russia, seeking and finding new opportunities in the wider world. Between 1880 and 1900 Africa, a continent four times the size of Europe, was parcelled out among the European powers. And when in 1898 the United States of America, following Europe’s lead, annexed Puerto Rico, the Philippines and other islands of the Pacific, and asserted a controlling voice in Latin American affairs, it seemed as though Western expansion had secured the domination of the white race over the non-white majority. But expansion carried with it the seeds of its own destruction. Even before European rivalries plunged the continent into the war of 1914–18, the beginnings of anti-European reaction were visible in Asia and Africa, and no sooner had the USA occupied the Philippines than they were met by a nationalist uprising.
