chapter one Oliver's early life
0:27
Oliver Twist was born in a workhouse and when he arrived in this hard world it
0:33
was very doubtful whether he would live beyond the first three minutes he lay on a hard little bed and struggled to start
0:41
breathing Oliver fought his first battle without much assistance from the two people
0:48
present at his birth one was an old woman who was nearly always drunk and
0:54
the other was a busy local doctor who was not paid enough to be very interested in Oliver's survival after
1:00
all death was a common event in the workhouse where only the poor and
1:05
homeless lived however Oliver managed to draw his first
1:11
breath and then announced his arrival to the rest of the workhouse by crying loudly
1:16
his mother raised her pale young face from the pillow and whispered let me see
1:22
the child and died the doctor turned away from the fire
1:28
where he had been warming his hands you must not talk about dying yet he
1:34
said to her kindly he gave her the child to hold lovingly she kissed the baby on its
1:41
forehead with her cold white lips then stared wildly around the room fell back
1:47
and died poor dear said the nurse hurriedly
1:55
putting a green glass bottle back in the pocket of her long skirt the doctor began to put on his coat
2:03
the baby is weak and will probably have difficulties he said if so give it a
2:10
little milk to keep it quiet then he looked at the dead woman the mother was a good-looking girl where
2:18
did she come from she was brought here last night replied the old woman
2:24
she was found lying in the street she'd walked some distance judging by her
2:30
shoes which were worn to pieces where she came from where she was going to or
2:36
what her name was nobody knows the doctor lifted the girls left hand
2:44
the old story he said sadly shaking his head no wedding ring I see yeah good
2:52
night and so Oliver was left with only the drunken nurse without clothes under his first
3:00
blanket he could have been the child of a king or a beggar but when the woman dressed him later in
3:08
rough cotton clothes yellow with age he looked exactly what he was an orphan in
3:14
a workhouse ready for a life of misery hunger and neglect
3:21
Oliver cried loudly if he could have known that he was a workhouse orphan
3:26
perhaps he would have cried even more loudly there was no one to look after the baby
3:33
in the workhouse so Oliver was sent to a special baby farm nearby there he and thirty other children
3:41
rolled around the floor all day without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing
3:48
mrs. Mann the old woman who looked after them was very experienced she knew what
3:55
was good for children and a full stomach was very dangerous to their health she
4:01
also knew what was good for herself so she kept for her own use the money that she was given for the children's food
4:08
the board responsible for the orphans sometimes checked on the health of the children but they always sent the Beadle
4:15
a kind of local policeman to announce their visit the day before so whenever
4:21
the board arrived of course the children were always neat and clean
4:26
this was the way Oliver was brought up consequently at the age of nine he was a
4:32
pale thin child and short for his age but despite frequent beatings by mrs. Mann
4:39
his spirit was strong which was probably the reason why he managed to reach the age of nine at all
4:46
on Oliver's ninth birthday mr. bumble the Beadle came to the house to see mrs.
4:52
Mann through the front window mrs. Mann saw him at the gate and turned quickly
4:57
to the girl who worked with her quick take Oliver and those others upstairs to
5:02
be washed she said then she ran out to unlock the gate it was always kept
5:08
locked to prevent official visitors walking in unexpectedly I have business to talk about mr. bumble
5:16
told mrs. Mann as he entered the house he was a big fat man often bad-tempered
5:21
and was full of self-importance he did not like to be kept waiting at a locked
5:26
gate mrs. Mann took his hat and coat placed a
5:31
chair for him and expressed great concern for his comfort you've had a long walk mr. bumble she said and you
5:39
must be thirsty she took out a bottle from the cupboard No thank you mrs. Mann
5:45
not a drop he waved the bottle away just a little drop mr. bumble with cold water
5:52
said mrs. Mann persuasively mr. bumble coughed
5:57
what is it he asked looking at the bottle with interest a gin I keep heaped
6:04
for the children's medicine drink you will give the children gin mrs. Mann
6:10
asked mr. bumble watching as she mixed his drink only with medicine sir I don't
6:16
like to see them suffer you're a good woman mrs. Mann
6:22
mr. bumble drank half his glass immediately I will tell the board about
6:27
you know the reason why I'm here Oliver Twist is nine years old today we've
6:36
never been able to discover anything about his parents then how did he get
6:42
his name I gave it to him said Mr bumble proudly we
6:48
follow the alphabet the last one was an S swab all and then it was tea so this
6:55
one is Twist the next one will be Unwin anyway Oliver Twist is now enough to
7:02
return to the workhouse bring him here please while mrs. Mann went to get him mr.
7:08
bumble finished the rest of his gin Oliver his face and hands now almost
7:14
clean was led into the room will you come along with me Oliver asked
7:21
mr. bumble in a loud voice Oliver was very glad to be free of mrs.
7:26
man's violence but he said nothing because she was angrily shaking her finger at him however as the gate closed
7:34
behind Oliver he burst into tears he was leaving behind the other children the
7:39
only friends he had and he realized at that moment how lonely he was in the
7:44
world mr. bumble walked on with long steps with Oliver on his short little legs
7:51
running beside him the feeling of contentment produced by gin and water had now disappeared and the beetle was
7:58
in a bad mood once more back at the workhouse Oliver was taken
8:04
to see the board he stood in front of ten fat men who were sitting around a table
8:09
what's your name boy asked a particularly fat man with a very round red face Oliver was frightened at the
8:17
sight of so many people and started to cry why are you crying the Beadle hit
8:24
him on the back and so naturally Oliver cried even more the boy is a fool one member of the
8:31
board announced you know you have no father or mother said the first man and that you were being brought up with
8:38
other orphans yes sir replied Oliver crying bitterly why is the boy crying repeated the other
8:46
man puzzled you have come here to be educated continued the fat man so you will start
8:52
working here tomorrow at a six o'clock Oliver was led away to a large room where on a rough hard bed he cried
9:00
himself to sleep the room in the workhouse where the boys were fed was a large stone Hall and at
9:08
one in the master and two women served the food this consisted of a bowl of
9:14
thin soup three times a day with a piece of bread on Sundays the
9:19
boys ate everything and were always hungry the bowls never needed washing the boys polished them with their spoons
9:26
until they Shawn after three months of this slow starvation one of the boys told the
9:34
others he was so hungry that one night he might eat the boy who slept next to him he had a wild hungry eye and the
9:42
other boys believed him after a long discussion they decided
9:47
that one of them should ask for more food after supper that evening and Oliver was chosen the
9:54
evening arrived the soup was served and the bowls were empty again in a few
9:59
seconds Oliver went up to the master with his bowl in his hand he felt very
10:04
frightened but also desperate with hunger please sir I want some more
10:12
the master was a fat healthy man but he turned very pale he looked to the little boy in front of
10:19
him with amazement nobody else spoke what he asked at last in a faint voice
10:27
please sir replied Oliver I want some more the master hit him with a serving spoon
10:34
then seized Oliver's arms and shouted for the Beadle the Beadle came quickly
10:39
heard the dreadful news and immediately ran to tell the board
10:45
he asked for more mr. limbkins the fattest board member asked in horror
10:52
bumble is this really true that boy will be hanged said the man who
11:00
earlier had called Oliver a fool you'll see if I'm not right Oliver was led away to be locked up and
11:07
the reward was offered to anybody who would take him away and use him for work
11:14
[Music] chapter 2
11:19
Oliver's first job Oliver stayed a prisoner alone in the
11:25
darkroom for a week he cried bitterly all day and when the long night came he
11:30
spread his little hands over his eyes to shut out the darkness and tried to sleep
11:36
he was given freezing water to wash with and was beaten daily by mr. bumble in
11:42
front of all the other boys in the hall as a warning to them
11:47
one day mr. bumble met the local Undertaker mr. Sowerberry outside the
11:53
workhouse do you know anybody who wants to chain a boy for work mr. Sowerberry
12:00
mr. bumble pointed at the notice on the wall above him which offered five pounds
12:06
to anybody who would take Oliver Twist for work mr. Sowerberry rubbed his chin and
12:12
thought for a while I pay enough for the poor with my taxes he
12:18
said so why shouldn't I be able to make use of them in my work yes I'll take the
12:24
boy myself and so the board agreed to send Oliver to
12:29
work for the Undertaker the necessary papers were signed Oliver's small possessions were put into
12:36
a brown paper parcel and he was led to mr. Sauber his house by mr. bumble as
12:42
they walked along tears began to run down Oliver's face
12:47
what is it this time asked mr. bumble impatiently don't be so ungrateful
12:54
this gentleman is going to look after you it's just that I'm so lonely sir said
13:01
the child everybody hates me please don't be angry with me sir
13:08
even mr. bumble felt a little pity he coughed told Oliver to dry his eyes
13:14
and be a good boy and walked on with him in silence
13:19
the Undertaker had just finished work for the day when mr. bumble entered his shop
13:25
here I've brought the boy said the Beadle Oliver bowed to the Undertaker who
13:32
raised his candle to get a better view of the boy mrs. Sowerberry he called and come on
13:38
have a look his wife a short thin woman with a disagreeable face came out to see
13:46
he's very small she said immediately he is agreed mr. bumble but he'll grow
13:53
mrs. Sowerberry yes she said crossly when he eats our food go on get downstairs she pushed
14:01
Oliver downstairs into a damp dark kitchen and called to the girl working down there here Charlotte give this boy
14:09
some meat that the dog left if he thinks he's good enough for him Oliver told the meat to pieces with his
14:15
teeth as if he were a wild animal mrs. Sowerberry watched him in silent horror
14:20
already thinking about her future food bills then took him upstairs to the shop
14:26
he will sleep here among the coffins she said Oliver stared around the dark airless
14:33
shop at the coffins some finished some only half made he trembled at the
14:38
thought of ghosts his bed was a small hole in the floor and looked very like a
14:43
grave but it was not only the room that depressed Oliver he felt very lonely
14:50
with no friends and no one to care for him as he lay on the bed he found
14:56
himself wishing that it really was his grave the next morning he was woken up by
15:04
someone kicking at the shop door open the door will you shouted a voice
15:09
through the keyhole yes sir I suppose you're the new boy said the
15:15
voice through the keyhole how old are you ten sir then I'll hit you when I get
15:20
in said the voice Oliver was experienced enough to know that the promise was probably true he
15:28
opened the door with a shaking hand then looked up and down the street all he
15:33
could see was a large boy wearing the uniform of one of the charity schools where the children of the very poor used
15:40
to go did you want a coffin asked Oliver innocently the charity-boy looked at him
15:48
fiercely you'll be needing a coffin soon workhouse if you make jokes like that I'm mr. Noah Claypole and you're working
15:55
under me now hurry up and open the curtains as he said this he kicked
16:01
Oliver and entered the shop he was a big clumsy boy of about 14 with a large head
16:07
and very small eyes added to these attractions were a red nose and dirty
16:13
yellow trousers the boys went down to breakfast which
16:18
the girl Charlotte had made for them she gave an extra piece of meat to Noah then
16:23
told Oliver to hurry up as it was his job to look after the shop did you hear that workhouse shouted Noah he heard
16:32
Noah said Charlotte leave him alone why asked Noah all his relations have
16:38
already left him alone his mother and father aren't going to interfere with him Charlotte and Noah both started laughing
16:45
loudly Oliver sat alone in the corner eating old bits of bread
16:51
Noah was a charity boy but not a workhouse orphan he at least knew who
16:56
his parents were but for a long time all the local shop boys had insulted him because he wore
17:03
the uniform of a charity boy now a fortune had brought him a creature in an even lower position in society
17:10
than himself Noah intended to repay to Oliver every insults he had ever
17:15
received and to make the new boy's life a misery after a few weeks mr. Sowerberry decided
17:23
that he liked Oliver's appearance enough to train him in the undertaking business Oliver's permanent expression of sadness
17:29
was very suitable the Undertaker thought for collecting dead bodies from houses
17:34
and accompanying the coffins to funerals one day mr. bumble came to tell them
17:41
about a woman who had died in an extremely poor part of the town and Sowerberry and Oliver went to collect
17:47
the body they went down dirty narrow streets where the houses on either side
17:52
were tall and large but very old some of the houses were almost falling
17:58
down and had to be supported by huge blocks of wood the area was so poor that
18:04
even the dead rats in the street looked as though they had died of hunger
18:09
they found the right house and climbed the dark stairs to a miserable little room
18:15
some children watched them from the shadows as they entered something lay beneath a blanket on the
18:21
floor in one corner a man and an old woman stood near the body Oliver was
18:28
afraid to look at them with their thin faces and sharp teeth they looked like
18:33
the rats he had seen outside as Sowerberry began to measure the body
18:38
for a coffin the man knelt on the floor and cried out she starved to death I
18:44
tell you that's why she died he fell to the floor and all the
18:49
children behind him started to cry Sowerberry and Oliver their work done
18:55
left as fast as they could they returned the next day with the
19:01
coffin and four men from the workhouse who were to carry it the man and the old woman followed the coffin to the church
19:07
and waited silently by the grave for the priest to arrive when at last he came he hurried through
19:15
the burial prayers and as quickly as possible it was only a job after all the
19:20
coffin was put into the ground at this point the husband who had not moved once
19:26
during his wife's burial not even during the long wait for the priest suddenly fainted to the ground and had
19:33
to have cold water thrown over him so how did you like it Oliver asked
19:39
Salaberry later as they walked home not not very much sir Oliver answered
19:45
truthfully you'll get used to it my boy Oliver wondered how long that would take
19:51
and remain silent all the way back to the shop thinking about everything that
19:56
he had seen and heard [Music]
20:03
Chapter three Oliver goes to London
20:08
Oliver was now officially an Undertaker's assistant it was a good
20:14
sickly time of year and coffins were selling well Oliver gained a lot of experience in a
20:20
short time and was interested to see how brave some people were after a death in
20:26
the family during funerals for some rich people for example he saw that the people who had
20:32
cried the loudest in church usually recovered the fastest afterwards he
20:38
noticed how in other wealthy families the wife or the husband often seemed quite cheerful and calm despite the
20:45
recent death just as if nothing had happened Oliver was very surprised to see all
20:51
this and greatly admired them for controlling their sadness so well
20:57
he was treated badly by most of the people around him Noah was jealous
21:02
because Oliver went out to burials while he was left back in the shop so he treated him even worse than before
21:09
Charlotte treated him badly because Noah did and mrs. solloway was his enemy
21:14
because mr. Sowerberry was supposed to be his friend one day something happened which might
21:22
seem unimportant but which had a great effect on Oliver's future Noah was in a particularly bad mood one
21:29
dinnertime and so he tried to make Oliver cry by hitting him pulling his hair and calling him horrible names this
21:37
was all unsuccessful so he tried personal insults workhouse how's your
21:42
mother he asked she's dead replied Oliver his face going red with emotion
21:49
Noah hoped that Oliver was going to cry so he continued what does she die of
21:55
workhouse of a broken heart I was told and a tear rolled down Oliver's cheek
22:02
why are you crying workhouse Oliver remained silent and Noah grew
22:08
braver you know I feel very sorry for you workhouse but the truth is your
22:13
mother was a wicked woman Oliver seems suddenly to wake up
22:19
what did you say she was so bad it was lucky she died or she
22:24
would have ended up in prison or hung his face bright red with anger Oliver
22:29
jumped up seized Noah's throat and shook the older boy so violently that his teeth nearly fell out then he hit him
22:37
with all his strength and knocked him to the ground he'll murder me screams Noah Charlotte
22:43
help Oliver's gone mad Charlotte and mrs. Sowerberry ran in and screamed in horror they took hold of
22:51
Oliver and began to beat him then Noah got up and started to kick him from
22:56
behind when they were all tired they forced Oliver who was still fighting and
23:01
shouting into the cellar and locked it mrs. Sowerberry sat down breathing
23:09
heavily he's like a wild animal she said we could all have been murdered in our
23:14
beds I hope mr. Sowerberry doesn't take any more of these dreadful creatures from
23:20
the workhouse said Charlotte poor now was nearly killed mrs. Aubrey looked at Noah
23:26
sympathetically Noah who was twice Oliver sighs pretended to rub tears from his eyes
23:33
what shall we do cried mrs. Sowerberry he'll kick that door down in ten minutes
23:39
they could hear Oliver banging and kicking at the cellar door Noah run and
23:44
get mr. bumble so Noah ran through the streets as quickly as he could to fetch the Beadle
23:51
when he reached the workhouse he waited for a minute to make sure his face was suitably tearful and frightened
23:58
as soon as mr. bumble came out Noah cried mr. bumble mr. bumble whit's
24:04
Oliver Twist sir he's become violent he tried to murder me sir and Charlotte and mrs. Sowerberry as well
24:10
mr. bumble was shocked and angry did him I'll come up there immediately and beat
24:17
him with my stick when he arrived at the shop Oliver was still kicking wildly at the cellar door
24:23
let me out he shouted from the cellar when he heard mr. bumbles voice I'm not
24:29
afraid of you mr. bumble stopped for a moment amazed and even rather frightened
24:35
by this change in Oliver then he said to mrs. Sowerberry it's the meat that's
24:41
caused this you know what meat madam you fed him too well
24:48
here back in the workhouse this would never have happened I knew I was too generous to him said mrs.
24:56
Sowerberry raising her eyes to the ceiling at that moment mr. Sowerberry
25:02
returned and hearing what had happened according to the ladies he beat Oliver's
25:07
so hard that even mr. bumble and mrs. Sowerberry were satisfied mr. Sowerberry
25:13
was not a cruel man but he had no choice he knew that if he didn't punish Oliver
25:19
his wife would never forgive him that night alone in the room with the coffins
25:26
Oliver cried bitter lonely tears he did not sleep and very early in the morning
25:32
before anyone was awake he quietly unlocked the shop door and left the house he
25:38
ran up the street and through the town as far as the main road where he saw a
25:44
sign that told him it was just 70 miles from there to London the name London gave the boy an idea
25:52
that huge place nobody not even mr. bumble could ever find him there
26:00
he had heard old men in the workhouse say it was a good place for brave boys
26:05
and that there was always work there for those that wanted it it would be the
26:10
best place for him he jumped to his feet and walked forward again
26:15
but after only four miles he began to realise just how far he would have to
26:21
walk he stopped to think about it he had a piece of bread a rough shirt two pairs
26:28
of socks and a penny but he could not see how these would help him to get to
26:34
London any faster so he continued walking he walked 20 miles that day the only
26:41
thing he had to eat was his piece of bread and some water which he begged from houses near the road he slept the
26:48
first night in a field feeling lonely tired cold and hungry he was even hungry
26:55
at the next morning when he woke up and he had to buy some more bread with his penny
27:00
that day he walked only 12 miles his legs were so weak that they shook
27:06
beneath him the next day he tried to beg for money but large signs in some villages warned
27:14
him that anyone caught begging would be sent to prison travelers on the road refused to give
27:20
him money they said he was a lazy young dog and didn't deserve anything farmers threatened to send their dogs
27:27
after him when he waited outside pub's the pub's owners chased him away because they thought he had come to steal
27:34
something only two people were kind enough to feed him an old woman and a gatekeeper on the
27:40
road if they had not given him some food he surely would have died like his mother
27:47
early on the seventh morning of his journey Oliver finally reached the little town of Barnet just outside
27:53
London exhausted he sat down at the side of the road his feet were bleeding and he was
28:01
covered in dust he was too tired even to beg then he noticed that a boy who had
28:08
passed him a few minutes before had returned and was now looking at him carefully from the opposite side of the
28:14
road after a long time the boy crossed the road and said to Oliver hello what's
28:21
the matter then the boy was about Oliver's age but was one
28:26
of the strangest looking people he had ever seen he had a dirty ordinary boy's face but he behaved as if he were an
28:33
adult he was short for his age and had little sharp ugly eyes his hat was stuck
28:40
on top of his head but it looked as though it would blow off at any minute he wore a man's coat which reached
28:46
almost down to his feet with sleeves so long that his hands were completely covered
28:52
I'm very tired and hungry answered Oliver almost crying I've been walking
28:58
for a week a week the magistrate's order was it
29:03
the magistrate but what's that a magistrate's a kind of judge explained
29:10
the surprised young gentleman he realised Oliver did not have much experience of the world never mind that
29:16
you want some food he went on I haven't got much money but don't worry I'll pay
29:22
the boy held Oliver to his feet and took him to a pub meat bread and beer were
29:28
placed before Oliver and his new friend urged him to satisfy his hunger while Oliver was eating the strange boy
29:36
looked at him from time to time with great attention going to London he asked him finally yes
29:44
got anywhere to live no money no a
29:50
strange boy whistled and put his arms into his pockets as far as the big coat sleeves would allow him I suppose you
29:58
want to sleep somewhere tonight don't you I do replied Oliver I haven't slept under
30:05
a roof since I started my journey well don't worry I've got to be in
30:10
London tonight and I know a very nice old gentleman there who'll let you live in his place and not even ask you for
30:16
money Oliver was deeply grateful for this offer of shelter and talked for a long
30:22
time with his new friend his name was Jack Dawkins but he was usually called
30:28
the artful dodger artful because he was very clever at getting what he wanted and Dodger
30:34
because he was very good at not getting caught when he did something wrong when he heard this Oliver felt rather
30:41
doubtful about having such a friend however he wanted first to meet the kind
30:47
old gentleman in London who would help him after that he could decide whether to
30:52
continue the friendship with The Artful Dodger
31:00
Chapter four Oliver in London
31:05
for some reason the Dodger did not want to enter London during daylight so it
31:11
was nearly eleven o'clock at night when they got near the centre Oliver had never seen a dirtier or more
31:17
miserable place the streets in this district were narrow and muddy and there
31:22
were terrible smells everywhere children wandered around even at this time of night in and out of the many
31:29
shops playing and screaming the pubs were full of people fighting and big
31:35
evil looking men stood in doorways or at dark corners Oliver almost wanted to run
31:40
away but just then the Dodger pushed open a door and pulled Oliver into a
31:46
dark Hall who's there a voice cried out it's me said the Dodger the faint light
31:54
of a candle appeared in the hall who's the other one a new friend
32:00
they went up some dark and broken stairs Oliver could hardly see where he was
32:06
going but the Dodger seemed to know the way and helped Oliver up they entered a
32:11
room with walls that were black with age and dirt in front of the fire was a
32:17
table with a candle stuck into a bottle of beer and an old man with a horribly
32:23
ugly face and red hair stood next to the fire cooking he was wearing a dirty old coat and
32:30
seemed to divide his attention between his cooking and a number of silk handkerchiefs which were hanging near
32:36
the fire there were several rough beds in the room four or five boys about the same
32:42
age as The Artful Dodger set round the table smoking and drinking like middle aged men they all looked up when the
32:50
Dodger and Oliver entered this is him Fagin the Dodger said to the old man my
32:56
friend Oliver Twist Fagin smiled and shook Oliver's hand
33:03
then all the young gentlemen came up to him and shook both his hands very hard
33:08
especially the hand which held his few possessions one of the boys was particularly kind he
33:15
even put his hands in Oliver's pockets so that Oliver would not have to empty them himself when he went to bed
33:21
the boys would probably have been even more helpful but Fagin hit them on their heads and shoulders until they left
33:28
Oliver alone we are very glad to see you Oliver said Fagin I see you're staring at the
33:35
handkerchiefs my dear aren't there a lot we've just taken them all out to watch
33:41
them that's all [Laughter] this seemed to be a joke as the old
33:48
gentleman and all his young friends gave loud shouts of laughter then supper began Oliver ate his share
33:55
of the food and was then given a glass of gin and water Fagin told him to drink it fast
34:01
immediately afterwards Oliver felt himself lifted onto one of the beds and he sank into a deep sleep
34:09
when he woke it was late morning Fagin was the only other person in the room
34:15
and he was boiling coffee in a pan when the coffee was done he turned towards
34:20
Oliver and looked closely at the boy Oliver was only just awake and his eyes were half closed so he seemed to be
34:28
still fast asleep Fagin then locked the door and from a
34:33
hidden hole in the floor he took out a small box which he placed carefully on the table his eyes shone as he opened it
34:41
and took out a gold watch covered in jewels oh
34:46
he said to himself what fine men they were loyal to the end they never told
34:54
the priest where the jewels were nor what about old Fagin not even at the very end and why should they it was
35:01
already too late it wouldn't have stopped the Rope going round their necks
35:07
Fagin took out at least six more watches as well as rings and bracelets and many
35:12
other valuable pieces of jewellery he looked at them with pleasure then replaced them what a good thing hanging
35:20
is he murmured dead men can never talk try old friends
35:25
at that moment he looked up and saw Oliver watching him he closed the lid of
35:31
the box with a loud crash and picked up a bread knife from the table why are you watching me what have you seen tell me
35:38
quick I couldn't sleep any longer sir said Oliver terrified I'm very sorry you
35:46
weren't awake an hour ago they get asked fiercely still holding the knife a
35:52
promise I wasn't sir replied Oliver don't worry he my dear Fagin said
35:59
putting down the knife and becoming once again the kind old gentleman he laughed
36:05
I only tried to frighten Hugh my dear you're a brave boy Oliver and did you
36:13
see any of the pretty things yes sir ah
36:18
said Fagin turning rather pale they they're mine Oliver all I have in my old
36:25
age Oliver wondered why the old man lived in such an old dirty place when he had so
36:32
many watches but then he thought that it must cost Fagin a lot of money to look after the Dodger and the other boys so
36:38
he said nothing and got up and washed when he turned towards Fagin the box had
36:45
disappeared soon the Dodger entered with a cheerful young man named Charley Bates have you
36:52
been at work this morning Fagin asked the Dodger hard at work answered the Dodger good boys good boys said Fagin
36:59
what have you got a couple of pocketbooks and some handkerchiefs good the workers aren't
37:06
they Oliver said the old man very good said Oliver the others all started
37:13
laughing though Oliver saw nothing funny in his answer Fagin inspected the handkerchiefs and
37:19
told the two boys that they were extremely well made and that he was very pleased with their work
37:25
after breakfast they played a very strange game the cheerful old man who'd
37:31
a watch in his jacket pocket with a guard chain round his neck and a notebook and a handkerchief in his
37:36
trouser it then he went up and down the room holding a walking stick just like
37:42
the old gentleman who walked in the streets sometimes he stopped at the fireplace and sometimes at the door pretending to
37:49
stare with great interest into shop windows he would then constantly look round as if afraid of Thieves touching
37:57
all his pockets in such a natural and funny way that Oliver laughed until the tears ran down his face
38:03
all the time the two boys followed Fagin everywhere and every time he turned
38:09
round they moved out of his sight so quickly that it was impossible to follow their movements
38:15
finally the Dodger bumped into him accidentally from behind and at that
38:20
moment both boys took from him very quickly his watch guard chain handkerchief and notebook if the old man
38:29
felt a hand in any of his pockets he cried out and then the game began again
38:34
later the boys went out again to do some more work when they had gone Fagin
38:41
turned to Oliver take my advice my dear he said make them your models especially
38:47
the Dodger he'll be a great man himself and will make you one too if you copy
38:52
him is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket my dear
38:57
yes sir said Oliver see if you can take it out without my
39:03
feeling it just as you saw them doing it when we were playing Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket
39:10
with one hand as he had seen the Dodger hold it and pulled the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other as it's
39:17
gone asked Fagin here it is sir said Oliver showing it in his hand you're a
39:24
clever boy him idea said the old gentleman putting his hand on Oliver's head I've never seen a quicker boy if
39:31
you go on like this you will be the greatest man in London now come here and I'll show you how to take the marks out
39:38
of handkerchiefs Oliver wondered what the connection was between playing and stealing from the
39:44
old gentleman's pocket and becoming a great man but he followed him quietly to the table and soon deeply involved in
39:51
his new study Oliver remained in Fagin's room for many days picking the marks and names out of
39:59
the handkerchiefs and sometimes playing the same game as before one evening two young ladies came to
40:07
visit and a very cheerful party followed Oliver thought they were very nice friendly girls
40:13
the Dodger and Charley Bates went out to work every day but sometimes came home
40:19
with no handkerchiefs and Fagin would get very angry once he even knocked them
40:24
both down the stairs and sent them to bed with no dinner because they had returned with nothing
40:30
at last the morning came when Oliver was allowed to go out to work with the two
40:35
other boys there are being no handkerchiefs for him to work on for several days and there
40:41
was not very much to eat for dinner the three boys set out but they walked so
40:46
slowly that Oliver thought they were not going to work at all then suddenly the
40:51
Dodgers stopped and put his finger to his lips what's the matter demanded Oliver be
40:59
quiet replied the Dodger do you see that old man outside the bookshop he's the one
41:05
Oliver looked from the Dodger to Charley Bates with great surprise and confusion but he had been told not to ask
41:12
questions the two boys walked quickly and secretly across the road towards the old
41:17
gentleman Oliver followed behind them watching in silent amazement
41:23
the old gentleman looked quite rich he wore gold glasses white trousers and had
41:30
an expensive walking stick under his arm he had picked up a book and was standing there reading it with great
41:36
concentration just as if he were in his own armchair at home Oliver his eyes wide with horror and
41:44
alarm watched as the Dodger put his hand in the old gentleman's pocket took out a handkerchief and handed it to Charley
41:50
Bates then the two of them ran round the corner as fast as they could suddenly the whole mystery of the
41:58
handkerchiefs and the watches and the jewels and Fagin became clear
42:03
Oliver stood for a moment in terror the blood rushing through him until he felt
42:08
he was on fire then confused and frightened he started to run at the same
42:15
time the old gentleman putting his hand to his pocket and realizing his handkerchief was missing turned round he
42:22
saw Oliver running away so he naturally thought Oliver was the thief with loud cries of stop thief he ran after Oliver
42:30
with the book still in his hand the old gentleman was not the only one
42:35
who started shouting the Dodger and Charley Bates not wanting to attract attention to themselves by running down
42:41
the street had stopped round the first corner when they realized what was happening they also shouted stop thief
42:48
and joined in the chase slight good citizens the cry of stop thief always causes
42:55
great excitement everybody in the street stopped what they were doing and began to shout themselves many joined in the
43:02
chase with enthusiasm and soon there was a big crowd running after Oliver
43:07
finally they caught the exhausted boy he fell down on the pavement and the crowd
43:12
gathered round him is this the boy they asked the old gentleman yes he answered leaning over
43:20
Oliver but I'm afraid he's hurt himself I did that said a huge young man proudly
43:27
and I hurt my hand doing it the old gentleman looked at him with an expression of dislike
43:34
Oliver lay on the ground covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth and looked wildly at all the faces
43:40
surrounding him at that moment a policeman arrived and took Oliver by the
43:45
collar come on get up he said roughly it wasn't me sir said Oliver looking
43:51
round it was two other boys they're here somewhere oh no they aren't replied the
43:57
policeman in fact he was right as the Dodger and Charley had quietly disappeared as soon as the crowd had
44:03
called Oliver come on get up don't hurt him said the old gentleman I
44:09
won't said the policeman tearing Oliver's jacket half of his back as he lifted him up
44:16
the three of them started walking followed by the excited crowd
44:22
[Music] chapter 5 Oliver's life changes
44:30
Oliver was taken to the nearest police station the officer at the gates looked at the boy another young thief a he
44:39
turned to the old gentlemen are you the person who was robbed sir yes I am
44:44
replied the old gentleman but I'm not sure that this boy actually took the
44:49
handkerchief I don't really want to take him to court too late he must go before
44:55
the magistrate now Oliver was locked in a small stone cell
45:00
which was disgustingly dirty and smelly as the key turned in the lock the old
45:06
gentleman said to himself thoughtfully there's something in that boy's face he
45:11
could be innocent have I seen someone like him before
45:17
after thinking about this for a few minutes he said no it must be
45:24
imagination he sighed unhappily and began reading the book again
45:29
some time later the officer touched his shoulder and told him that the court was ready a
45:36
magistrate was a judge who dealt with small crimes in local courts and the magistrate for this district was well
45:42
known his name was mr. Fang and he was a disagreeable bad-tempered man today he
45:49
was in a particularly bad mood he frowned angrily at the old gentleman and asked sharply who are you my name sir is
45:59
Brownlow officer what is this man charged with he's not charged sir answered the
46:06
officer he's accusing the boy the magistrate looked at mr. Brownlow from head to foot and what have you got
46:13
to say mr. Brownlow began to explain I was standing outside a bookshop be quiet sir
46:20
shouted mr. Fang policeman now you arrested the boy what happened
46:26
the policeman told the magistrate what he had heard and how he had searched Oliver after woods and found nothing are
46:34
there any witnesses asked the magistrate none answered the policeman
46:39
mr. Fang then turned to mr. Brownlow and angrily told him to describe what had
46:45
happened mr. Brownlow explained that he had run after the boy only because he saw him
46:50
running away he did not think that the boy was the actual thief and he hoped that the boy would not be punished he's
46:57
been hurt already he added and now I am afraid he's very ill I don't believe
47:03
that for a moment said Mr Fang unpleasantly he turned to Oliver come
47:09
now don't try any clever tricks with me what's your name he demanded Oliver tried to reply but he was too
47:16
weak to speak he was deadly pale and he felt the room spinning round him
47:21
at last he managed to whisper a request for water but the magistrate refused
47:27
angrily suddenly Oliver fainted and fell to the floor mr. Fang stared at him angrily guilty
47:35
three months prison he said immediately let him lie there he'll soon be tired of that mr. Fang stood up this Court is now
47:44
closed at that moment a man in an old black coats rushed in stop he shouted don't
47:52
take the boy away I saw it all I'm the bookshop owner mr. fangs face was black with anger at
48:00
this unexpected interruption but the bookshop owner demanded to be heard he
48:05
described exactly what had really happened he had seen two boys steal the handkerchief and then run away leaving
48:11
Oliver to be arrested in a final burst of bad temper mr. Fang
48:17
said that his time had been wasted he announced that Oliver was innocent and ordered everybody out of the court
48:24
the order was obeyed and as mr. Brownlow turned to go down the street he saw
48:30
Oliver lying on the pavement shaking his face as white as death
48:35
poor boy poor boy said Mr Brownlow bending over him he called a coach
48:42
quickly lay deliver on the seat and drove away the coach stopped at a neat house in a
48:49
quiet shady Street in North London Oliver was gently carried into a bed and
48:54
received more care and kindness than he had ever had in his life but he had a
49:00
fever and for many days he lay there unconscious when he eventually awoke weak thin and pale he looked anxiously
49:08
around the room what room is this where am i he said
49:13
this is not the place I fell asleep in mrs. Bedwin the motherly old housekeeper
49:20
heard his words and instantly came to him harsh be quiet my dear or you'll be
49:26
ill again lie down he lay down and woke up again much later
49:32
after a while he was able to sit up in a chair although he was still too weak to
49:38
walk in this new position he could see a picture of a woman hanging on the wall
49:43
opposite who is that madam he asked the old housekeeper I
49:48
don't know my dear do you like it the eyes look so sad and they seem to be
49:56
staring at me as if the person was alive and wanted to speak to me but couldn't
50:01
your weakened nervous after your illness mrs. Bedwin said kindly don't worry
50:07
about things like that later that day mr. Brownlow came in
50:12
having heard that the boy was a little better at last he was delighted to see that Oliver could sit up but when he saw
50:19
Oliver's face clearly mr. Brownlow stared hard at him I
50:24
hope you're not angry with me sir said Oliver anxiously no no not in the least he replied then
50:34
he turned to the housekeeper but look mrs. Bedwin look there he pointed to the picture of the woman
50:41
above Oliver's head and then to the boy's face it was a living copy of the
50:46
picture even the expression was the same Oliver did not understand what was
50:52
happening he was so alarmed by mr. Brownlow's excitement that he fainted more
50:59
the Dodger and Charley Bates had left the crowd which was chasing Oliver as soon as they could they went back to
51:06
their house through the narrow streets using a complicated route in case anyone was following them
51:11
once they were safely away from other people Charley Bates rolled on the ground and laughed and laughed
51:19
when I saw Oliver running away so fast round all the corners bumping into walls and all the time I had the heck achieve
51:27
in my pocket [Laughter] but what will Fagin say asked the Dodger
51:33
what do you mean the Dodgers had nothing more but led Charley Bates into the
51:39
house and up the stairs when Fagin saw them enter he rose to his feet where's
51:45
Oliver he asked him furiously the two boys looked uneasily at each other but
51:51
said nothing Fagin took hold of the Dodgers collar and shook him violently tell me or I'll
51:58
kill you the Dodger slid out of his coat in one smooth movement leaving Fagin holding
52:05
only the empty coat the police have got him he said
52:10
reluctantly he looked round for a weapon to fight with but Fagin already had a heavy metal
52:16
pot in his hand he threw it hard at the Dodger but missed and hit Charley Bates who started to shout with fear
52:23
suddenly all this noise and confusion was silenced by a deep voice at the door
52:29
what the devil was going on here The Voice demanded
52:35
the owner of the voice was a big man of about thirty-five in a black coat and very dirty trousers with a brown hat on
52:43
his head and a dirty handkerchief around his neck he also had a three-day-old
52:48
beard a white dog with torn ears followed him into the room the man
52:54
kicked the dog into a corner and looked round at the signs of battle are they
52:59
trying to murder you Fagin I would if I was them I'd have done it long ago now
53:06
give me some beer and don't poison it it was said as a joke but if the man had
53:12
seen the evil look on Fagin's face he might have thought the warning was a necessary one
53:18
Fagin produced some beer and as the fight appeared to be over everybody sat
53:24
down in the conversation that followed Fagin told the newcomer that Oliver had
53:30
been caught by the police I'm afraid mr. Sikes he said the boy may say something
53:37
which will get us into trouble very likely said Bill Sikes smiling
53:42
unkindly you've got problems Fagin and I'm afraid added Fagin ignoring Sikes
53:50
his remark that if we are in trouble then a lot of other people will be in trouble too if you understand me my dear
53:58
Sikes turned angrily towards the old man there was a silence then Sikes said
54:04
somebody must find out what's happened if he hasn't said anything yet we must
54:10
catch him when he leaves the police station Fagin nodded but there was a difficulty
54:17
none of them wanted to go anywhere near a police station the problem was solved with the arrival
54:24
of the two young ladies whom Oliver had met one evening in Fagin's house Nancy Maher there Fagin said he smiles
54:32
sweetly at one of the young ladies can you go to find out what's happened to
54:38
Oliver the young lady answered calmly no I won't
54:43
you're the only one here that the police in this district don't know said Sikes she'll go Fagin no repeated Nancy yes
54:54
she will Fagin Sikes was right with a mixture of
55:00
threats and promises he soon persuaded Nancy to go she set off at once and at the police
55:06
station pretended to be a shy frightened girl it's my poor little brother Oliver here
55:13
she asked the officer with the keys he's not here the officer replied the gentleman's got him the gentleman Oh No
55:21
what gentleman cried Nancy very upset the policeman explained that Oliver had
55:27
become ill and the old gentleman had taken him to his house in the Pentonville district of North London
55:33
Nancy still looking terribly upset left the station and hurried back to Fagin's
55:39
house with this news as soon as he heard it Sikes called his white dog put on his
55:45
hat and left without saying goodbye to anyone we must find him Fagin said urgently to
55:53
the rest of them no one can stay here it's too dangerous now all of you walk
55:59
around Pentonville and keep your ears open don't come back until you have some
56:04
news of Oliver if you can kidnap him we've got to keep him quiet before he
56:10
starts talking about us to his new friends with these words he pushed them all from
56:17
his room and double locked the door behind them then he took out his hidden box and very carefully hid all the
56:24
watches and the jewellery beneath his clothes
56:30
[Music] chapter 6 Oliver is found again
56:38
Oliver began to recover and slowly regain his strength the picture that had
56:44
caused mr. Brownlow's excitement was taken down from the wall and was not mentioned again
56:50
Oliver was disappointed to the disappearance of the picture since he liked the woman's face but he had many
56:56
other things to think about now they were happy days while Oliver was
57:01
getting better he played cards with mrs. Bedwin and listened to stories about her
57:07
family the days were all so quiet and relaxing after the hardships and poverty
57:12
of his previous life mr. Brownlow bought him a new suit and new shoes and Oliver's dirty old clothes
57:20
were given away one day mr. Brownlow asked him to come to
57:25
his study for a little talk Oliver went in and sat down he looked at mr. Brownlow serious face
57:33
in alarm don't tell me you're going to send me away sir please he exclaimed let
57:39
me stay here I could help with the housework please sir My dear child don't
57:46
be afraid said mr. brownlow kindly i won't desert you i believe that you're a
57:53
good boy not a common thief you told me you're an orphan and that seems to be
57:59
the truth but i want to hear now the whole story of your life and how you came to be with the boys i saw you with
58:06
that day oliver began his story but was soon interrupted by the arrival of mr.
58:12
grimwig an old friend of mr. Brownlow's mr. grimwig was a fierce old gentleman
58:18
and very fond of arguments he clearly knew all about Oliver and inspected him
58:23
closely so this is the boy is it he said at last
58:28
Oliver bowed politely and was introduced by mr. Brownlow he was then brought in
58:34
and during the meal mr. grimwig stared so hard at Oliver that the boy felt rather confused
58:41
eventually mr. grimwig whispered to mr. Brownlow he may be a good looking boy
58:47
but I think he's deceiving you my good friend nonsense said Mr Brownlow becoming angry
58:53
well we'll see answered his friend we'll see later that afternoon mr. Brownlow wanted
59:02
to return some books to a bookseller and to send some money for new books that he had already collected mr. grimwig
59:08
suggested that Oliver should go he'll be sure to deliver everything safely he
59:14
said with a smile yes please let me take them said Oliver delighted to be of use
59:21
mr. Brownlow hesitated but Mr grimwig smile had annoyed him
59:26
very well he said here are the books Oliver and a
59:31
five-pound note the bookseller will give you ten shillings change I
59:38
won't be ten minutes replied Oliver eagerly and he ran out into the street
59:43
sir you expect him to come back do you inquired mr. grimwig yes I do said Mr
59:50
Brownlow smiling confidently don't you know he has a new suit of clothes some
59:58
valuable books at a five-pound note in his pocket he'll join his old friends the thieves and laugh at you if he comes
1:00:04
back I'll eat my hat the two men sat by the window with a pocket watch between them and waited for
1:00:12
Oliver's return oliver hurried through the streets to the bookshop thinking how lucky he was
1:00:20
suddenly there was a loud scream behind him oh my dear brother
1:00:27
before he could look round a pair of arms was thrown tightly around his neck don't he cried struggling let Co why are
1:00:35
you stopping me who is it the young woman holding him started to cry loudly I've found him Oh Oliver you naughty boy

1:00:50
tears and several people stopped to stare at what was happening what's the matter asked one of the
1:00:56
watching women he ran away from his parents a month ago the young woman said
1:01:02
the hard-working respectable people and he left them to join a gang of thieves and bad characters and almost broke his
1:01:09
mother's heart Jerome you horrible child said another woman yes go back to your parents said a
1:01:16
third but I haven't gotten he replied Oliver greatly alarmed I haven't got a

sister either I'm an orphan I live in Pentonville listen to him make him come home the
1:01:30
young woman said to the crowd or your kilise dear mother and father and bright Maya heart suddenly Oliver recognized
1:01:38
the woman he had seen in Fagin's house it's Nancy he said without thinking
1:01:44
you see cried Nancy to the crowd he knows me just then a big man ran out of
1:01:51
a beer shop followed by a white dog what's this young Oliver come home to
1:01:57
your poor mother you young devil and what books are these you've stolen them haven't you give them to me
1:02:04
the man who was Bill Sikes seized Oliver with one strong hand and hit him on the
1:02:09
head with the other they all do him good shouted some of the crowd is the only
1:02:15
way to treat boys like him Bill Sikes held on to Oliver's arm come
1:02:20
on you young thief still weak from illness and terrified by
1:02:26
the growling dog Oliver could not resist he was taken through the dark narrow
1:02:32
streets at great speed Sikes and Nancy gave him no chance to escape and Oliver had no breath to call out for
1:02:40
help all too quickly he was back in Fagin's house where his old friends were
1:02:45
waiting for him delighted to see you looking so well my dear Fagin said bowing politely why
1:02:54
didn't you write and say you were coming we'd have got something warm for supper
1:03:00
the Dodger and Charley Bates roared with laughter and the Dodger began looking
1:03:05
through the books Oliver had with him keep them back Oliver cried those books
1:03:10
belong to the kind old gentleman who took me into his home send him back the books and the money you think I stole
1:03:16
them you're all right laughed Fagin he will think that Oliver
1:03:23
jumped to his feet and ran wildly from the room shouting for help the Dodger and Fagin caught him easily and brought
1:03:30
him back then the old man picked up a long piece of wood so you wanted to get
1:03:37
away my dear did you wanted to call the police and get help we'll cure you of
1:03:44
that he hid Oliver hard on the shoulders with a stick he was raising it for a
1:03:50
second hit when Nancy rushed forward and seizing the piece of wood threw it into the fire I won't let you do it faking
1:03:58
she shouted you've got him again isn't that enough now leave him alone
1:04:03
Fagin and Sikes looked at each other shocked by her reaction you better keep quiet ma girl growled
1:04:12
Sikes now I won't cried the girl wildly now you've got the boy you'll turn into
1:04:18
a thief and a liar isn't that enough without killing him too she rushed at Fagin and would have hit
1:04:25
him if Sikes had not held her arms so tightly that she couldn't move she struggled wildly for a while then
1:04:31
exhausted she fainted Sikes laid her down in the corner as surprised as Fagin
1:04:38
at her anger she can be really wild when she's angry Sikes said
1:04:44
Fagin wiped his forehead that's the trouble with women he said but she's a
1:04:50
clever girl in her work then Charley Bates and the Dodger took
1:04:56
away Oliver's expensive new suit gave him some old clothes and locked him up
1:05:01
in a dark room Oliver felt tired and ill and was soon fast asleep
1:05:09
[Music] chapter 7 the robbery a
1:05:18
few days later a visitor arrived in London from Oliver's hometown he was a
1:05:24
large fat man and very proud of his hat which showed the world that he was a
1:05:29
most important official it was in fact mr. bumble the Beadle Oliver's old enemy
1:05:36
mr. bumble had completed his business in the city and had just finished a most
1:05:41
satisfactory meal in a pub he pulled up his chair to the fire to enjoy his hot
1:05:47
gin and water in comfort and opened the newspaper the first thing he saw was
1:05:52
this notice the reward of five pounds is offered for
1:05:58
any information leading to the discovery of a young boy Oliver Twist who was
1:06:03
kidnapped from his home in Pentonville last Thursday evening I am also very
1:06:08
interested in any information about his past
1:06:13
there was then a full description of Oliver's clothes and appearance and mr. Brownlow's full address mr. bumble
1:06:21
rubbed his eyes read the notice again and was at the address in less than ten minutes he was shown into mr. brownlow
1:06:28
study with the old gentleman and his friend mr. grimwig was sitting do you
1:06:33
know whether poor boy is now mr. brownlow asked when the beetle had explained the reason for his visit mr.
1:06:40
bumble shook his head and you know anything good about him asked mr. grimwig looking closely at mr.
1:06:46
bumbles face mr. bumble shook his head again very seriously and turned down the corners of
1:06:54
his mouth then tell us everything you know about him said Mr Brownlow impatiently
1:07:01
mr. bumble put down his hat unbuttoned his coat folded his arms and sat back in
1:07:07
his chair he spoke in his most important and official voice and talked for 20
1:07:13
minutes his listeners heard all the details of Oliver's illegitimate birth
1:07:18
and how generously he had been treated as a workhouse orphan they heard how he
1:07:24
had always been an ungrateful and dangerous child violently attacking another boy and finally running away
1:07:31
from the house where he had been working the old gentleman shook his head sadly
1:07:36
and gave mr. bumble the five pounds I would have been happy to give you three
1:07:42
times the amount if your story had proved that the boy was good if mr. bumble had known this earlier he
1:07:50
might have told a different story but now it was too late so he took the money and left
1:07:57
mr. Brownlow walked up and down his room for several minutes deep in thought he
1:08:02
rang the bell for mrs. Bedwin his housekeeper and told her what he had heard I don't believe it she said with
1:08:10
great certainty I was right said Mr grimwig with satisfaction you should
1:08:15
have listened to what I said mr. brownlow said angrily never let me hear the boy's name again never remember
1:08:23
that mrs. Bedwin there were sad hearts at mr. Brownlow's house that night
1:08:30
meanwhile in another part of London Oliver remained a prisoner Fagin had
1:08:36
told Oliver how ungrateful he had been to run away he had told him that he would have died of hunger without
1:08:41
Fagin's kindness he went on to tell Oliver the store of another young boy who had gone to the police to tell them
1:08:48
about the gang but who had finally been hanged one morning for being a thief
1:08:53
Fagin described the hanging and terrifying detail and said that he hoped he would never have to tell the police
1:09:00
about Oliver and see Oliver with a rope around his neck Oliver felt his blood to turn cold
1:09:08
he remained locked in a room for many days seeing nobody between early morning
1:09:13
and midnight he spent his time thinking sadly about his friends in Pentonville
1:09:19
after a week he was free to wander around the house during the day it was a
1:09:24
dirty place full of rats and insects but no other living thing all the windows
1:09:30
were closed and covered with wood and metal bars that kept out the light one afternoon the Dodger and Charley
1:09:38
Bates were at home and they started telling Oliver about their lives as thieves
1:09:43
why don't you become one Charlie asked him we all are here both of us and Fagin
1:09:50
Sikes Nancy all of us I don't want to be replied Oliver I wish they'd let me go
1:09:58
but it's a good life the Dodger said taking some coins from his pocket and throwing them up in the air what does it
1:10:04
matter where the money comes from he said laughing if you don't steal it someone else will you can be sure of
1:10:11
that Fagin entered at this point with two young men and joined in the conversation
1:10:16
one of the young men had just come out of prison and there were many cheerful jokes about his very short haircut
1:10:23
everybody sat around the fire talking and laughing for hours Fagin told Oliver
1:10:29
how good the Dodger was at his job and what a friendly boy Charlie was it was
1:10:34
without doubt an interesting evening for Oliver after so many days locked up alone
1:10:41
after that evening he was rarely on his own again he spent a lot of time with
1:10:46
the Dodger and Charley and often played the handkerchief game with them at other times Fagin would tell them all about
1:10:52
robberies he had committed in his younger days telling the stories so well and putting in so many funny detail that
1:10:59
Oliver could not stop laughing even though he knew it was wrong Fagin knew what he was doing he had made
1:11:07
sure that Oliver was so lonely and miserable that he would be desperate for any friends however criminal slowly and
1:11:14
deliberately Fagin was trying to poison the young boy's mind
1:11:20
one damp cold windy night a few weeks later Fagin put on his heavy coat and
1:11:26
with the collar pulled up high to hide his face left his home he walked fast
1:11:32
through the streets never losing his way even in the darkest places finally he reached an evil narrow
1:11:40
streets lit only by a single lamp he knocked on a door said something quietly
1:11:45
to the person who opened it then walked upstairs Bill Sikes was sitting by his fire with
1:11:53
his dog when Fagin entered the room was a small dark place with almost no furniture Nancy was there too and Fagin
1:12:01
glanced at her uneasily he had not seen her since she had attacked him to stop him hitting Oliver however she seemed to
1:12:09
have forgotten all about it because she told him to pull up a chair and warm himself by the fire
1:12:14
I'm all ready for business bill Sikes said looking at Fagin suspiciously say
1:12:20
what do you have to say Fagin it's about the robbery at Chertsey bill
1:12:26
answered Fagin some lovely silver in that house down there I know I know
1:12:33
Sikes said I was down there two nights ago to have a look at the house but it's
1:12:39
locked like a prison at night all except one part where's that asked Fagin bending his
1:12:46
head for words his eyes staring excitedly at Sikes do you think I'm stupid I'm not telling you anyway what
1:12:55
we need is a boy so there's a small place where only a boy can into the house asked Fagin maybe
1:13:03
the we need a boy there was silence for a time while Fagin
1:13:09
thought then he made a sign to Sikes to tell Nancy Tilly the room though worried
1:13:15
psych said you can trust her she won't talk isn't that right of course it's
1:13:22
right answered the young woman taking a large drink from the bottle on the table and laughing
1:13:27
anyway faking I know your idea is for Oliver to do the job you order clever
1:13:34
girl said Fagin smiling evilly that's exactly what I had in mind listen bill
1:13:40
the boys been training for a few weeks and it's time he did some work he's the
1:13:45
smallest one anyway is he safe asked Sikes because if he
1:13:50
tries and he tricks on me I'll kill him you be ours for life if he feels he's
1:13:57
one of us and this job will make him feel like that said Fagin eagerly
1:14:02
the boy looked so innocent he's perfect and we've got to include him in some
1:14:08
crime as soon as we can otherwise if he escapes now he can tell the police about
1:14:14
us and stay free himself so it was decided that Oliver would help
1:14:20
Sikes with the robbery in two days time the plan was discussed in great detail
1:14:25
and all the arrangements made by then Sikes was very drunk and Fagin got up to
1:14:32
leave as he put on his coat he stared hard at Nancy frowning a little no he
1:14:40
was sure he could trust her she was loyal the next night Oliver was alone in
1:14:47
Fagin's house when Nancy entered she was so nervous and white-faced that Oliver asked her if she was ill God forgive me
1:14:55
she said beating her hands together I never thought I would do this has anything happened asked the boy what
1:15:02
is it she sat with her back to him and hid her face with her hands after a while she
1:15:09
said I don't know I feel so strange sometimes come on Oliver are you ready
1:15:15
you have to come with me to Bill's house why oh
1:15:20
nothing important Oliver did not believe her but he thought that at last this might be an
1:15:26
opportunity to escape so he said rather too quickly I'm ready
1:15:31
Nancy guessed what he was thinking Oliver she said this is not the time to
1:15:38
escape I've saved you once and I will again but if anything happens tonight it might mean my death she said this so
1:15:46
seriously that Oliver decided it must be true he was quiet while they walked quickly
1:15:52
through the streets to Sikes house inside his room Sikes set Oliver down on
1:15:58
a chair did he come quietly he asked Nancy caught as a mouse glad to hear it said
1:16:07
Sikes now listen to me boy he put a gun against Oliver's head if you say one
1:16:14
word when you're outside with me I'll shoot you understand Oliver nodded trying hard not to tremble
1:16:23
Sikes and Oliver started out at five o'clock in the morning while it was
1:16:28
still dark they crossed from one side of London to the other at first the streets were
1:16:35
empty then shops began to open and people started going to work gradually the noise and traffic
1:16:43
increased and as they passed through the meat market at Smithfield Oliver was
1:16:48
amazed by the sight and smells of so many animals and by the huge crowds of people all pushing and swearing and
1:16:55
shouting but Bill Sikes marched on without stopping
1:17:00
later in the day they were given a lift in a horse and cart from West London out into the country night fell and after
1:17:09
walking a few more miles down country roads they finally arrived at an old house standing alone by a river it was
1:17:16
dark and seemed to be empty they went inside without knocking
1:17:22
inside were two other men who had Sikes command produced food and drink for him
1:17:27
and the boy then Sikes told Oliver to get some sleep as they would be going out again later that night Oliver still
1:17:35
had no idea of the purpose of this expedition but his head ached with tiredness and he soon fell asleep
1:17:42
at half-past one the men got up and checked their equipment gathering
1:17:47
several sticks as well Sikes and the man called Toby left the house together with Oliver walking
1:17:53
between them there was now a thick fog and the night was very still as they
1:17:59
hurried through the deserted streets of the nearby town out in the country again they walked down several small roads
1:18:06
until finally they stopped at a house surrounded by a high wall as quick as lightning Toby climbed up
1:18:14
and pulled Oliver after him inside the garden they crept towards the house and
1:18:19
now for the first time Oliver realized in horror that the purpose of the
1:18:25
expedition was robbery and maybe even murder Bill Sikes broke open a small window at
1:18:32
the back of the house then shown his light into Oliver's face now listen I'm going to put you through
1:18:40
here now straight through into the hall and onto the front door and let us in and if you don't you can be sure I'll
1:18:46
shoot you Oliver stupid with terror was lifted through the window into the house
1:18:53
desperately he decided to try to run upstairs and warn the family he began to
1:18:59
creep forwards suddenly there was a loud noise from the hall come back shouted Sikes back back
1:19:07
Oliver stood still frozen with fear a light appeared then two men on the
1:19:13
stairs then a sudden bright flash and a loud bang Oliver staggered back Sikes
1:19:19
seized the boys collar through the window and pulled him back out into the garden I hit him shouted Sikes he's
1:19:26
bleeding a bell rang loudly above the noise of more gunshots and the shouts of
1:19:31
men Oliver felt himself being carried across rough ground and then he saw and
1:19:37
heard no more [Music]
1:19:43
chapter eight after the robbery
1:19:48
the night was bitterly cold a sharp wind whipped the Fallen snow up into the air
1:19:54
and blew it into every hole and corner it was a night for the homeless to lie
1:20:00
down and die and for luckier people to sit close to their fires and thank God they were at home
1:20:06
in the workhouse where Oliver was born mrs. Corney the widow in charge was
1:20:13
making tea by her fire when she heard a knock at her door she frowned and called out sharply come in
1:20:22
the Frome however was quickly changed to a sweet smile when she saw mr. bumble
1:20:27
enter hard weather mr. bumble said the widow
1:20:33
yes indeed mom replied the beadle we've had to give out to the poor people in
1:20:39
this town great quantities of bread and cheese today and they're still complaining why one man even came back
1:20:45
and demanded some free firewood what does he want that for people are never
1:20:51
satisfied give them one thing today and tomorrow they'll ask for something else
1:20:57
mrs. Corney agreed that it was very shocking they discussed some workhouse business
1:21:02
together and then mr. bumble looked hopefully at the teapot mrs. Corney
1:21:08
offered him some tea instantly mr. bumble sat down by the fire and gave the widow such a warm
1:21:14
smile that her face turned a delicate pink she passed mr. bumble the teacup
1:21:20
and as he took it he managed to give her hand a little stroke
1:21:25
you're a kind hearted woman mrs. Corney said the Beadle Oh
1:21:31
mr. panda ha said the widow smiling shyly for a while there was a friendly silence
1:21:38
between them then mr. bumble moved his chair closer to the widows mrs. Corney
1:21:44
of course did not notice this but when the beadles arm began to slide around her waist she felt she must make a small
1:21:51
protest encouraged by this response mr. Bumble immediately gave her a kiss but at this
1:21:58
interesting moment there was a sudden knock at the door mr. bumble jumped to his feet and went to the other end of
1:22:05
the room please mrs. Corney said a voice outside old
1:22:10
Sally's going fast well what can I do to help her asked mrs. Corney angrily nothing mom replied
1:22:18
the old woman outside but she says she has something to tell you which you must hear she won't die quietly till you come
1:22:28
complaining loudly mrs. Corney asked mr. bumble to wait until she came back then
1:22:34
she followed the old woman up the stairs old Sally lay in bed in a freezing cold
1:22:40
room the fire was so small and mean that it gave no warmth at all
1:22:46
mrs. Corney bent over the bed and the dying woman opened her eyes
1:22:52
come closer she murmured let me whisper in your ear
1:22:58
she held onto mrs. corney's arm and pulled her down towards her in this same
1:23:03
room I once helped a pretty young woman who came in with cut and bleeding feet
1:23:09
who gave birth to a boy and then died well as mrs. Corney impatiently I
1:23:17
robbed her she was hardly dead before I stole it stole what it the only thing
1:23:26
she had it was gold he could have saved her life
1:23:31
gold who was this mother tell me she told me to look after it when she
1:23:38
died the old woman's mind was getting confused she trusted me poor girl and I stole it
1:23:47
quick tell me or it may be too late said mrs. corney greedily what was it and
1:23:53
what was the boy's name the old woman could hardly speak Oliver
1:23:59
the cold a stole was his is what
1:24:05
the old woman fell back onto the bed dead
1:24:11
mrs. Corney hurried back to her room where mr. bumble was still admiring her furniture and counting her silver
1:24:17
teaspoons they sat down again by the fire and soon mr. bumbles arm returned
1:24:23
to its previous position round mrs. corney's waist it was not long before he asked her to marry him and the widow
1:24:30
happily accepted him while they drank to celebrate the arrangement mrs. Corney
1:24:36
told Mr bumble about old Sally's death and the unknown gold object which she
1:24:41
had stolen from the dead body of the young woman after many expressions of undying love
1:24:47
mr. bumble finally left the room and returned home with bright visions of his future
1:24:54
while these events were happening in the workhouse The Artful Dodger and Charley Bates were playing cards in Fagin's
1:25:01
house the Dodger as usual was winning easily somehow he always seemed to know
1:25:07
exactly what cards the other players had in their hands suddenly there was a faint ring on the
1:25:13
Bell downstairs and Toby came in the man would gone with Bill Sikes and Oliver to
1:25:18
rob the house in Chertsey Fagin jumped to his feet where are they he screamed
1:25:24
Sikes and the boy where are they hiding we failed said the robber what happened
1:25:32
they fired and hit the boy we ran away with Oliver between us and they chased
1:25:37
us with dogs and the boy what about the boy gasped Fagin his head was hanging
1:25:43
down and he was cold we needed to go faster so we left him in a field alive
1:25:49
or dead that's all I know about him Fagin did not wait to hear any more he
1:25:55
gave an angry scream ran out of the house and hurried through the streets until he reached Bill Sikes house as he
1:26:02
climbed the stairs he thought well Nancy if there's anything going on here I'll
1:26:07
find out about it however clever you are Nancy was alone upstairs in her room her
1:26:14
head on the table she's be drinking again thot Fagin as he
1:26:20
closed the door she woke up he told her what had happened during the robbery she said nothing and ahead returned to the
1:26:28
table and where do you think the boy is now my dear Fagin asked her trying hard
1:26:34
to see her face poor little child left alone like that
1:26:40
Nancy looked up I hope the child's tater then he'd be
1:26:46
happier than any of us what said Fagin in amazement it's better like that the sight of the
1:26:54
boy turns me against myself and all of you you're drunk they can suddenly lost his
1:27:01
temper the boys worth a fortune to me and now a drunken gang has lost him and
1:27:07
if Sikes doesn't return that boy to me dead all alive I'll tell the police about him and I'll get Sikes and just
1:27:14
remember that when Fagin left her Nancy was already
1:27:20
back in a drunken sleep her head lying on the table once more Fagin went out into the blackness of the
1:27:26
night and walked home he had reached the corner of his Street and was searching in his pocket for his key when a dark
1:27:33
figure came out of the shadows and crossed the road towards him I've been waiting here for two hours Fagin said
1:27:40
the stranger where have you been on your business my dear said Fagin glancing at
1:27:47
him uneasily we better talk inside the door closed behind them and they
1:27:53
crept quietly up to the top floor in order not to wake the sleeping boys downstairs they sat in a dark room the
1:28:00
only light coming from a candle burning in the passage outside a stranger's name was monks and he was in
1:28:08
an evil mood he listened to Fagin for a while frowning heavily
1:28:14
it was badly planned he said angrily couldn't you have made the boy into an
1:28:20
ordinary thief and then got him arrested and sent out of the country for the rest of his life but he isn't like the other
1:28:26
boys here Fagin said I had nothing to frighten him with
1:28:31
anyway I've already helped you after Lee was caught by the police stealing from the bookshop I got Nancy to get him back
1:28:37
and then she felt sorry for him killer monk said impatiently we can't afford to
1:28:45
do that kind of thing said Fagin but I can turn the boy into an ordinary thief
1:28:50
now and then Nancy will harden her heart against him I know how women are but if
1:28:57
he's already dead that's not my fault said monks quickly I always said to you
1:29:03
do anything you want to him but don't kill him I wouldn't have been able to forget it if you had
1:29:09
suddenly he jumped to his feet staring at the wall opposite the door what's
1:29:14
that he whispered terrified what where cried Fagin the shadow I saw the shadow a wound
1:29:22
passed along that wall white-faced they both ran from the room into the passage the candle through long
1:29:28
shadows down the stairs but there was no one there they listened only silence
1:29:34
filled the house it was your imagination said Fagin softly I swear I sweet
1:29:42
replied monks they searched all the upstairs rooms they were empty and as quiet as death
1:29:50
monks grew calmer and eventually left the house at one o'clock in the morning
1:29:57
the chase down at Chertsey the previous night had not lasted long there was a
1:30:03
lot of noise of men shouting and dogs barking as the servants from the house pursued the robbers across the fields
1:30:09
but Sikes and Toby wasted no time they dropped Oliver's unconscious body in a
1:30:14
field and disappeared into the fog and the darkness in different directions
1:30:20
the three pursuers lost enthusiasm for the chase and agreed among themselves that it was much too dangerous to
1:30:26
continue they returned to the house keeping close together and trying to look brave
1:30:33
morning came but Oliver's still lay in the field as if dead it began to rain
1:30:40
heavily and after a while Oliver opened his eyes his left arm was covered in blood and
1:30:46
hurting badly he felt so weak he could hardly stand but he knew that if he
1:30:52
stayed where he was he would die gasping with pain he forced himself to
1:30:57
his feet and with slow shaky steps began to walk he had no idea where he was
1:31:03
going and moved forward mechanically as though in a dream
1:31:08
after a while his feet found a road and he looked round and saw a house in the distance
1:31:14
he decided he would rather die near human beings than in a cold field so he
1:31:19
turned his steps towards the house as he came nearer he realized that the house
1:31:25
was familiar and he felt faint with terror but where else could he go
1:31:31
with a last effort he crawled up the path and knocked on the door then fell
1:31:37
exhausted on the step it was now mid-morning
1:31:42
inside the house the men's servants were still describing the Nights adventures to the cook and the servant girl who
1:31:48
gasped with appreciative horror at every exciting moment they were all enjoying
1:31:53
themselves very much when there came a knock at the door tail with fright they all stared at each
1:32:01
other nobody was keen to answer the knock so eventually they all went including the dogs very cautiously they
1:32:09
opened the door and saw nothing more alarming than poor Oliver curled up in a sad little heap on the step
1:32:15
then one of the men gave a shout seized the boy by a leg and pulled him into the hall here he is he cried excitedly
1:32:23
here's the thief I shot him last night a young lady appeared at the top of the
1:32:29
stairs what's going on here quiet please is this poor boy that he hurt very said
1:32:37
the servant proudly then one of you go to town as fast as you can and fetch a policeman and doctor losberne the rest
1:32:44
of you helped to carry the boy upstairs and put him to bed treat him kindly I beg you
1:32:52
[Music] chapter 9 Oliver starts another life
1:33:00
in a comfortable Pleasant sitting room the two ladies of the house waited anxiously for the doctor and the police
1:33:06
to arrive the owner of the house mrs. maylie was an older woman but her niece
1:33:12
Rose was a girl of seventeen who was quiet beauty and gentle charm won all
1:33:17
hearts as soon as the doctor arrived he ran breathlessly into the house and burst
1:33:24
into the room without knocking he was clearly a good friend of the ladies I never heard was such a dreadful thing
1:33:30
you should both be dead of fright he said to mrs. Maylie in the Silence of
1:33:35
the night - are you both all right why didn't you send for me at once
1:33:41
we are quite all right said Rose smiling but there's an injured boy upstairs whom
1:33:46
aunt wants you to see doctor losberne went up to examine Oliver and was there for some time he
1:33:54
came down looking rather puzzled and asked the two ladies to see the boy with him I
1:34:00
can promise you there's nothing very frightening about him he said instead of the evil looking robber they
1:34:07
expected to see the two ladies found only a pale thin child lying peacefully
1:34:12
asleep he looked so innocent that mrs. maylie said this child could never have been in
1:34:19
a gang of robbers it certainly seemed strange agreed the doctor but wickedness can hide behind
1:34:26
the most gentle face you know but he's so young - cried Rose can you really
1:34:32
believe this poor boy is a criminal Oh doctor losberne and my dear aren't I beg
1:34:38
you both to have pity on him mrs. maylie did not need persuading and the doctor could not resist roses tears
1:34:46
he had in fact an extremely kind heart which he tried to hide behind a quick
1:34:51
fierce manner though this usually deceived no one well what's to be done then he said
1:34:58
quickly we'll have the police here at any moment ready to take the boy away and throw him into prison
1:35:05
Rose begged him to think of a plan and the doctor thought hard for a few minutes frowning fiercely at last he
1:35:13
said I've got it and rubbed his hands together in satisfaction a
1:35:19
little later Oliver woke up and was very anxious to tell his story although he
1:35:24
had lost a lot of blood and was very weak when the doctor and the ladies had heard all about his sad life they were
1:35:31
quite sure that they wanted to save Oliver from any unfair punishment so doctor losberne went down to the
1:35:37
kitchen to talk to the three servants who had surprised Sikes and Oliver during the robbery the doctor folded his
1:35:43
arms and gave the men a long hard stare tell me he began can you be absolutely
1:35:52
sure that the boy upstairs is the same one that was in the house last night well
1:35:58
the doctor usually such a friendly man seemed so angry that the servants stared
1:36:03
at him open mouthed the doctor gave them no time to think and went on fiercely three men see a boy for about a second
1:36:11
in the dark in the middle of a lot of smoke and noise a boy comes to the same house the next day and because one arm
1:36:19
is injured they think he must be the robber are you going to swear that this is the same boy well what do you say he
1:36:27
finished impatiently the servants looked at each other in great confusion
1:36:32
suddenly there was a ring at the gate the police officers had finally arrived
1:36:37
doctor losberne gave orders that plenty of beer should be served before the officers went up to see Oliver he also
1:36:44
made sure that the servants had a generous amount of beer too when the officers were finally allowed
1:36:51
to see Oliver doctor losberne said this is a boy who was shocked this morning while walking on a farmer's property
1:36:57
where he shouldn't have been the servants saw him and immediately thought he must be the same boy from last night
1:37:03
but now they say they're sure it's not the same boy the servants were by now so confused by
1:37:09
beer and excitement that they were not sure of anything at all the robbers had certainly had a boy with them they said
1:37:16
but whether this boy was the same boy well it seemed very doubtful the police
1:37:23
too had drunk quite a lot of beer by now and before long they were very willing to believe that Oliver was knocked the
1:37:29
robber of the night before they had their own ideas about who committed all the robberies in the area and Oliver was
1:37:35
unknown to them at last the police left and Oliver was
1:37:40
allowed to recover in the kind care of mrs. maylie rose and dr. losberne it was
1:37:47
several weeks before he was well enough to get out of bed but then he quickly grew stronger and every day told his
1:37:53
rescuers how grateful he was one thing however caused him unhappiness he wanted to find mr. Brownlow the kind
1:38:02
old man who had looked after him in London mr. Brownlow would be pleased to know how happy I am now he said
1:38:09
so when dr. losberne offered to take Oliver to London to see mr. Brownlow the
1:38:14
boy was very pleased they set out by coach one fine morning and when they arrived in London they
1:38:21
went straight to mr. Brownlow's house Oliver's heart beats with excitement as they stopped outside
1:38:27
but the house was empty they were told by the people next door that mr. Brownlow had moved to the West
1:38:35
Indies six weeks before Oliver was very disappointed he had
1:38:40
thought about mr. Brownlow's so much recently and had always hoped to find him again but now the kind old man had
1:38:47
moved abroad still believing Oliver was a lying thief and he might hold this belief until the day he died
1:38:55
this was a bit of disappointment to Oliver but his new friends were still as kind to him as ever they left the house
1:39:02
in Chertsey and moved to a quiet cottage in the country taking Oliver with them spring came and in the fresh air away
1:39:10
from the noise and smoke and trouble of the city Oliver began a new life he went
1:39:16
for walks with rose and mrs. Maylie or rose red to him and he worked hard at
1:39:22
his lessons he felt as if he had left behind forever the world of crime and
1:39:28
hardship and poverty [Music]
1:39:36
chapter ten life in the country the week slipped contentedly past and
1:39:43
spring turned into summer Oliver was now a strong and healthy boy and very fond
1:39:49
of rose and mrs. maylie as they were of him one hot summer evening after a walk in
1:39:56
the country Rose became very weak and pale and confessed she felt ill
1:40:02
by the next morning she was in a dangerous fever and mrs. maylie and Oliver were afraid she might die
1:40:09
mrs. maylie sent Oliver to the nearest town four miles away to post to express
1:40:15
letters one was to doctor losberne in Chertsey the other to Harry Maylie mrs.
1:40:21
MELAS son Oliver filled with anxiety ran as fast
1:40:26
as he could along the country roads and across the fields until hot and exhausted he reached the town he posted
1:40:34
the letters and turned to hurry home again as he was running past a pub in the Main Street he accidentally bumped
1:40:40
into a tall man in black coming out the man stared at Oliver what the devil's
1:40:47
this he said stepping back I'm sorry sir I was in a hurry and
1:40:52
didn't see you the man murmured angrily to himself who would have thought it curse him I
1:40:59
can't get away from him I'm sorry sir repeated Oliver frightened by the man's
1:41:05
wild staring eyes the devil break your bones the man said through his teeth what are
1:41:12
you doing here he raised his hand and started towards Oliver with a mad look in his eyes but fell violently to the
1:41:20
ground shaking and gasping in a fit people hurried up and helped the man into the pub while Oliver thinking that
1:41:27
the man was mad ran quickly home mrs. maylie and oliver passed a
1:41:34
sleepless night and rose grew steadily worse as the fever burned in her Oliver
1:41:39
said every prayer he had ever learned ten times over
1:41:44
the next day dr. losberne and Harry Maylie arrived and the house was full of worried faces an anxious whispers but
1:41:52
the danger passed and by the next night dr. losberne was able to announce that those seriously ill rose would not die
1:42:00
Oliver cried for joy a day or two later mrs. maylie talked
1:42:07
privately to her son Harry was a handsome young man of about 25 with a cheerful honest face and
1:42:14
friendly manners he was clearly very fond of rose I know that you want to marry rose mrs.
1:42:22
Maylie told her son and she is the nicest person I know but I want you to
1:42:28
remember one thing her birth mother that means nothing to
1:42:33
me said the young ma'am I love her I know you do Harry but she herself is
1:42:39
well aware of her doubtful birth and this might affect her answer if you ask her to marry you I know you have
1:42:46
ambitions to enter politics if you marry a woman with a stain on her name even though it's not her fault it
1:42:55
might spoil your chances of success in life society is cruel Harry people might use
1:43:02
the knowledge of your wife's doubtful birth against you and against your children too and one day you might begin
1:43:11
to regret your marriage only a selfish man would do that mother
1:43:16
Harry answered impatiently no I am quite determined I have loved Rose for a long
1:43:21
time and nothing will ever change that mrs. maylie sighed and she I know is very fond of you but
1:43:30
she herself may try to protect you and refuse an offer of married from you for your sake remember that Harry
1:43:37
but now I must go back and sit with her will you tell her how much I've worried
1:43:43
about her asked Harry and how anxious I am to see her again of course I will
1:43:49
replied mrs. Maylie some days after this conversation Oliver
1:43:55
was sitting in the room where he studied in the evenings it was a warm night and he'd been studying hard for some hours
1:44:03
he fell asleep at his desk and started dreaming he dreamt that he was in
1:44:08
Fagin's house again and could see the old man sitting in his corner whispering to another man yes my dear he heard
1:44:17
Fagin say you are right that's him in Oliver's dream the other man answered
1:44:24
of course it is I told you I'd seen him I'd recognize him anywhere if I walked
1:44:31
across his unmarked grave I'd know it was him buried under the ground he said this with such hatred that
1:44:37
Oliver woke up from fear in front of him at the open window so near he could
1:44:43
almost touch them were Fagin and the strange wild man he had bumped into outside the pub in the town in a flash
1:44:50
they were gone Oliver sat still white with terror for a second then shouted loudly for help
1:44:59
Harry and dr. losberne came running and hearing what had happened they rushed outside into the night and searched the
1:45:06
garden and the fields around there was no sign of anybody
1:45:11
it must have been a bad dream Oliver said Harry breathless after running through the fields he had heard all
1:45:18
about Oliver's past from his mother no replied Oliver still frightened I saw
1:45:24
them both as plainly as I see you now nothing more was seen or heard of the
1:45:29
two men and after a few days the event was forgotten rose recovered rapidly and
1:45:34
was soon able to go outside again Harry Maylie waited a few days then as his
1:45:39
mother had expected he asked rose to marry him and as his mother had warned
1:45:45
him Rose refused don't you love me he asked her holding
1:45:51
her hand I do she whispered but please try to
1:45:57
forget me it would ruin your future as a politician if anybody found out about my birth I could never never forgive myself
1:46:06
Harry paused for a few minutes one thing DeRose could you have accepted
1:46:14
if your past had been different or if I'd been poor and friendless with no hope of riches or success I
1:46:21
could answered rose covering her face to hide her tears but as you are I could never
1:46:29
be more than a friend to you I shall ask you once more said Harry
1:46:35
softly in a year's time or less I shall ask you to change your mind
1:46:42
the girl shook her head and smiled sadly no it will be useless
1:46:49
Harry left the next day having asked Oliver to write to him secretly with news of his mother and rose from an
1:46:57
upstairs window Rose watched him leave with tears in her eyes
1:47:04
mr. bumble was now a married man and not a happy one he was no longer a Beadle
1:47:10
but the manager of the workhouse and his wife formerly mrs. Corney scolded and
1:47:15
argued with him day and night one evening after a particularly violent
1:47:20
fight when she threw things at him and chased him out of the house he went for a walk alone through the town he felt
1:47:27
very sorry for himself and finally went into a pub to find comfort in gin and water a
1:47:33
tall dark man sitting in the corner watched mr. bumble while he drank the
1:47:39
strangest clothes were dusty and muddy as if he had traveled a long way
1:47:45
mr. bumble began to feel uncomfortable at the man's hard stare and tried to
1:47:50
avoid meeting his eyes I've seen you before the stranger said
1:47:56
eventually you were the Beadle here I was but I don't recognize you it doesn't
1:48:03
matter I came here to look for you and I'm lucky to have found you I'd like some information
1:48:09
he pushed a couple of coins across the table what information asked mr. bumble
1:48:17
suspiciously slipping the coins into his pocket about a workhouse birth
1:48:23
a boy called Oliver Twist young twist hmm I remember him he was a
1:48:30
dreadful it's not him I want to talk about interrupted the stranger now heard
1:48:36
enough of him it's the old woman it was the nurse for his mother where is she oh
1:48:43
she died last winter said Mr bumble then he remembered that his wife had been
1:48:49
there when old Sally had died and he realized that this information might be worth something he told the man that one
1:48:57
woman had been with the nurse when she died and had heard some secret from her where can I find this woman the stranger
1:49:04
asked quickly showing in his pale face how important this was to him I can
1:49:10
bring her to meet you tomorrow said Mr bumble all right down by the river at
1:49:15
9:00 in the evening the man wrote the address on a piece of paper and your name asked mr. bumble
1:49:23
monks replied the stranger but you don't need to remember it then he quickly left
1:49:29
the pub the next evening was dark and cloudy a storm threatened and already the first
1:49:36
drops of rain were falling mr. and mrs. bumble walked up the main street of the town then turned towards a group of
1:49:43
ruined old houses next to the river mr. bumble went first carrying a dim light
1:49:48
and his wife followed closely behind at the oldest and most ruined building they
1:49:54
stopped and mr. bumble took out his piece of paper the first distant crash
1:50:00
of thunder shook the air and the rain began to pour down heavily then they heard monks calling out of an upstairs
1:50:06
window he snapped the man mrs. bumble asked her husband yes and be careful to say as
1:50:15
little as you can don't tell him I'm your wife monks opened a small door saying
1:50:20
impatiently come in don't keep me waiting mr. bumble was only brave when dealing
1:50:26
with poor helpless people he felt very uneasy about entering this dark building
1:50:32
with an ill-tempered stranger however he was equally afraid of his wife
1:50:37
nervously he followed her through the door inside monks stared at mrs. bumble for
1:50:44
some time so this is the woman is it yes replied mr. bumble cautiously as
1:50:52
they walked upstairs there was a bright flash of lightning outside followed by
1:50:58
loud thunder they sat down at the table and monks started immediately so you
1:51:04
were present when the old woman died is that right and she told you something he
1:51:09
stared at mrs. bumble again yes said mrs. bumble something about the
1:51:15
mother of Oliver Twist but first how much will you pay me for the information
1:51:21
if it's what I want to hear twenty-five pounds said monks but it's a lot of
1:51:28
money for something which has been lying dead for twelve years reluctantly he pushed the money across
1:51:34
the table towards her then bent forward to listen the faces of the three nearly
1:51:40
touched as the two men leant over the table to hear what the woman had to say and the woman leant over towards them so
1:51:46
that they could hear her whisper in the dim lamplight their faces looked pale and ghostly
1:51:53
the old woman who was the nurse died with only me in the room said mrs.
1:51:59
bumble no one else was there asked monks fiercely no one good said monks go on
1:52:08
she spoke about a young woman who had given birth in the same bed some years
1:52:13
before the child was Oliver Twist and this nurse had robbed the child's mother
1:52:20
robbed in life asked monks in death she
1:52:25
stole from the potty when it was hardly cold but the old woman fell back and
1:52:31
died before she could tell me more it's a lie shouted monks furiously you no
1:52:37
more I'll kill you about if you don't tell me what else she said she said no more repeated mrs. bumble
1:52:45
calmly showing unlike mr. bumble no fear of the strange man's violence
1:52:50
in her hand I found a piece of dirty paper which contained nothing it was
1:52:58
only a receipt from a pawnbroker I went to the pawnbroker and got back a little
1:53:03
gold locket inside was a gold wedding ring and on the locket itself the name
1:53:10
Agnes she put the locket on the table in front of monks
1:53:15
he picked it up immediately and looked at it closely his hands shaking
1:53:21
is this all it is and now I want to ask
1:53:27
you a question what do you intend to do with the locket this so he can never be used against me
1:53:35
monks suddenly pushed the table to one side and opened a small door in the floor down below rushed the river it's
1:53:43
muddy waters swollen by the heavy rain if you threw a man's body down there
1:53:48
where would it be tomorrow asked monks twelve miles downriver and cut to pieces
1:53:56
replied mr. bumble in a shaky voice monks tie the locket to a heavy weight
1:54:03
and dropped it into the water in a second it was gone the three of them
1:54:08
looked into each other's faces and seemed to breathe more freely now we have nothing more to say said
1:54:16
monks with a threatening look at mr. bumble and nothing to say to anyone else either do you understand
1:54:24
certainly said Mr bumble very politely he moved away from the strange man
1:54:30
anxious to leave quickly at the door to the street monks turned
1:54:35
again to mr. bumble and if we ever meet again we don't know each
1:54:42
other do you understand that as well perfectly said the relieved mr. bumble
1:54:50
moving away into the rain and pulling his wife with him
1:54:59
Chapter eleven Nancy makes a visit
1:55:05
on the evening after the bumbles little business meeting mr. Bill Sikes waking
1:55:11
from asleep called out to ask the time the room he was lying in was very small
1:55:17
and dirty it was a different room from the one he had occupied before the Chertsey expedition but it was in the
1:55:23
same poorer part of London there were so few possessions or comforts in the room
1:55:29
but it was clear mr. Sikes had met hard times he himself was thin and pale from
1:55:35
illness and was lying on the bed wrapped in an old coat the white dog lay on the
1:55:41
floor next to him seated by the window was Nancy repairing
1:55:46
Sikes old jacket she too was thin and pale at Sikes voice she raised her head from
1:55:54
her work not long past 7 she said how do you feel
1:56:00
now bill as weak as water help me get up will you as
1:56:06
Nancy helped him out of bed Sikes swore and cursed at her clumsiness illness had
1:56:12
not improved his temper he wouldn't speak like that if you knew how kindly I'd nursed you these last few
1:56:19
days said Nancy so many nights I've looked after you she sat down in a chair
1:56:25
exhausted get up shouted Sikes what's wrong with
1:56:30
you but Nancy was unable to get up her head fell back against the chair and she
1:56:36
fainted Sikes swore and cursed again but Nancy remained unconscious
1:56:43
what's the matter here asked a voice from the door and Fagin followed by The
1:56:48
Artful Dodger and Charley Bates entered the room when they saw Nancy they
1:56:54
hurried to help her Charlie rubbed her hands and the Dodger gave her a drink from the bottle he
1:57:00
carried gradually Nancy recovered her senses Sikes then turned to Fagin
1:57:08
you here for he asked roughly you haven't been here for weeks all the time I was ill I haven't two coins to rub
1:57:15
together why didn't you help me you treat me worse than a dog don't be
1:57:21
bad-tempered my dear said Fagin calmly I haven't forgotten you bill
1:57:27
well what about some money then I've done enough work for you recently what
1:57:32
about some money I haven't a single coin with me my dear said Fagin then go and
1:57:39
get some you've got lots at home no I don't trust you Nancy can go back with you to your house
1:57:46
and fetch some money or stay here and sleep after a good deal of arguing Fagin
1:57:53
managed to reduce the amount Sykes was demanding from five pounds to three pounds he went back to his house with
1:57:59
Nancy and the boys when they were inside Fagin told the
1:58:05
girl I'll just go upstairs and fetch the cash for Bill my dear there's little
1:58:10
money in this business Nancy little money in no thanks but I'm fond of seeing the young people around me
1:58:17
suddenly there was a man's voice at the front door as soon as Nancy heard it she
1:58:22
set up in her chair that's the man I was expecting earlier said Fagin don't worry he'll only be ten
1:58:30
minutes the man entered the room it was monks
1:58:36
when he saw Nancy he moved back as if he had expected no one but Fagin it's all
1:58:42
right only one of my young people Fagin said to him did you see him yes answered
1:58:50
monks any news good news said monks with a smile let me
1:58:57
have a word with you he and Fagin went upstairs to talk privately
1:59:02
as soon as they had left the room Nancy took off her shoes and crept silently up
1:59:07
the stairs to listen in the passage as she had done once before she was gone for a quarter of an hour
1:59:14
then like a ghost she reappeared in the downstairs room and sat down
1:59:21
immediately afterwards the two men descended the stairs her pale you are Nancy said fagin once
1:59:29
monks had left the house what have you been doing to yourself nothing except waiting here for you too
1:59:37
long she answered turning her face away from him now where's the money for bill
1:59:42
with a sigh for every piece of money Fagin put the agreed amount into her
1:59:47
hand when Nancy was out in the street again she sat down on a doorstep and for a few
1:59:54
minutes seemed unable to move then she started running wildly through the streets and when she was exhausted she
2:00:01
stopped and burst into tears this strange mood seemed to leave her
2:00:06
then and she turned and hurried back to Sikes house at first when she returned Sikes noticed
2:00:14
nothing unusual about her Fagin with his sharp suspicious eyes who would have noticed something at once but as night
2:00:22
came the girls nervous excitement increased and even Sikes was alarmed by the paleness in her cheeks and the fire
2:00:29
in her eye he lay in bed drinking hot gin and water and staring at her
2:00:36
you look like a corpse that's come back to life again what's the matter with you tonight
2:00:42
nothing why are you staring at me so hard either you've caught the fever yourself
2:00:49
or no you're not going to he wouldn't do
2:00:55
that do what asked the girl
2:01:01
there's not a girl alive as loyal as you if you weren't I'd have cut your throat
2:01:07
in months ago no you must have the fever coming on that's it now give me some of
2:01:13
my medicine Nancy quickly poured out his medicine with her back to him he took it and
2:01:19
after turning restlessly for some time he eventually fell into a deep heavy
2:01:25
sleep the trucks in effect at last Nancy said
2:01:31
to herself as she rose from her position beside the bed I'm not too late
2:01:37
quickly she put on her coat and hat looking round fearfully as if she expected at any moment to feel Sikes
2:01:44
heavy hand on her shoulder she kissed the robbers lips softly then ran from
2:01:49
the house without a sound she hurried in the direction of West London pushing past people on the
2:01:56
pavement and running across crowded streets without looking the woman is mad
2:02:01
said the people turning to look at her as she rushed past them she came to a wealthier part of the town
2:02:08
where the streets were quieter and before long she had reached her destination
2:02:13
it was a family hotel in a quiet Street near Hyde Park the clock struck eleven
2:02:19
as she entered the man at the desk looked at her and asked what do you want here I
2:02:27
want to see Miss Meili the man looked at the young woman with strong disapproval she won't want to see
2:02:35
someone like you come on get out let me see her or two of you will have to throw
2:02:41
me out said Nancy violently the man looked at her again and decided
2:02:47
it would be easier to do as she asked he led her upstairs to Rosie's room Nancy entered with a brave face but with
2:02:54
fear in her heart please sit down and tell me why you wish to see me said Rose Maylie looking with
2:03:01
some surprise at this poor rough girl from the streets Rosie's manner was so kind of sincere
2:03:07
and so unexpected that Nancy burst into tears when she had recovered a little she
2:03:14
asked is the door shut yes answered rose a
2:03:19
little nervously but why because I'm about to put my life and the
2:03:25
lives of others in your hands I am the girl that kidnapped little Oliver and
2:03:31
took him back to old Fagin's house on the night Oliver was going to the bookseller you said rose yes it was me I
2:03:39
am that wicked creature you have heard about I've no friends except thieves and
2:03:44
robbers I've lived on the street since I was a child cold hungry among people
2:03:50
were always drunk and fighting and that's where I'll die too I
2:03:55
pity you said rose in a broken voice but I'll tell you why I'm here too you know
2:04:02
a man called monks no answered rose he knows you I heard
2:04:10
him tell Fagin that you were at this hotel maybe he's changed his name
2:04:16
sooner after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery I listened in secret to a conversation
2:04:22
between monks and Fagin in the dark and I heard monks say that he'd seen Oliver
2:04:27
in the street and that he knew at once Oliver was that child he was looking for although I couldn't hear why
2:04:35
monks then agreed to pay Fagin some money if he could find Oliver again and more money if he could turn the poor boy
2:04:42
into a thief why asked rose he saw my shadow on the wall as I
2:04:50
listened and I had to escape I didn't see him again until last night and what
2:04:55
happened then I listened at the door again and a heard monk say this so the only proof of the
2:05:04
boy's identity is at the bottom of the river and the old woman who received it
2:05:09
is dead he and Fagin laughed then monk said that
2:05:15
he had all Oliver's money safely now but how funny it would be if the boy went to
2:05:21
prison for stealing after his father's unfair will
2:05:26
what is all this ask rose it's the truth lady then monk said he couldn't have
2:05:34
Oliver killed because suspicions would point to himself but he'd try for the rest of his life to harm the boy if he
2:05:41
could then monks laughed again about the money Oliver should have got from his father's will my young brother Oliver
2:05:49
will never see that money he said his brother
2:05:55
Lindros those were his words said Nancy looking round uneasily as if she's still
2:06:00
expected to see Sikes and then he talked about how amazed you would be if you
2:06:07
knew who Oliver really was and this man was serious
2:06:12
his voice was full of anger and hatred I know many people who do worse things but
2:06:18
I'd rather listen to all of them than to this man monks but I must get back now or people will wonder where I've been
2:06:25
back how can you go back to such a life astros
2:06:31
you've told me all this now I can help you by letting you stay somewhere safe
2:06:37
now perhaps it's hard for you to believe but
2:06:42
there's one man the most dangerous of them all that I can never leave
2:06:47
you're the first person who's ever spoken to me so kindly but it's too late
2:06:52
it's never too late it is cried the girl I can't leave him now and if I tell
2:07:01
anyone about this man he'll die but how can I find you again when we
2:07:07
want to investigate this mystery further I'll meet you secretly if you promise
2:07:14
not to watch or follow me said Nancy and if you promise just one more thing not
2:07:21
to do anything to hurt the man I can never leave I promise
2:07:27
every Sunday night between 11:00 and 12:00 I will walk on London Bridge if I am
2:07:33
alive meet me there if you want more information as Nancy said these words she left the room
2:07:41
and ran down the stairs and out into the street once more rose was left alone her thoughts in
2:07:48
great confusion as she wondered desperately what to do and who to ask for advice
2:07:55
the next morning Oliver who had been out walking ran into Rosie's room at the
2:08:01
hotel he was breathless with excitement I can't believe what I've seen now
2:08:07
you'll all know that I've told you the truth he shouted I know you've always
2:08:12
told us the truth but what are you talking about asked rose I've seen mr.
2:08:17
brownlow the kind man who was so good to me we're going into a house said Oliver
2:08:23
crying with joy I've got the address here quick Sid Rowse call coach I'll take you there immediately
2:08:30
the idea came to Rose that perhaps mr. Brownlow would advise her she had been
2:08:37
afraid to tell Nancy's story to dr. losberne since the good doctor was very excitable and often acted with more
2:08:43
enthusiasm than wisdom in less than five minutes they were in the coach on their way to the address
2:08:50
Rose went in first to talk to mr. Brownlow alone she was taken into his
2:08:55
study and polite greetings were exchanged when they were seated again Rose said this will surprise you very
2:09:03
much but you were once very kind to a dear friend of mine and I'm sure you
2:09:09
will be interested to hear news of him really and may I ask you his name
2:09:15
Oliver Twist mr. Brownlow's had nothing for a few seconds but simply stared at Rose
2:09:22
finally he moved his chair nearer to her and said with great feeling I once
2:09:28
thought that he was a liar and a thief if you have evidence to show me I was
2:09:35
wrong please tell me at once I know him to be a child with a warm heart
2:09:40
said Rose and despite the hardships of his life he's a better person than
2:09:45
almost anyone I know I looked for him everywhere said Mr
2:09:51
Brownlow but I could never find him I could never quite believe that he really
2:09:56
did intend to rob me Rose told him everything that had happened to Oliver since then she
2:10:02
finished by saying and his only sorrow for some months has been that he could
2:10:08
not find you his former friend thank God said Mr Brownlow this is great
2:10:17
happiness to me great happiness but why haven't you brought him with you
2:10:22
miss Meili he's waiting in a coach at the door replied rose
2:10:28
mr. Brownlow hurried out of the room down the stairs and into the coach without another word in a minute he had
2:10:34
returned with Oliver how well he looks he said new clothes the same sweet face
2:10:41
but not so pale the same eyes but not so sad they talked with great joy for some time
2:10:49
then mr. Brownlow sent for mrs. Bedwin the old housekeeper she came in quietly
2:10:54
and waited for her orders you get blinder every day said Mr
2:11:00
Brownlow impatiently people's eyes at my time of life don't improve with age replied the old lady
2:11:07
then put on your glasses as she searched for them in her pocket Oliver could not
2:11:13
wait any longer and ran into her arms dear God she said it's my innocent boy
2:11:20
my dear old nurse tried Oliver I knew he would come back said the old lady
2:11:26
holding him in her arms how well he's dressed how well he looks again she
2:11:32
laughed and cried at the same time and could not let Oliver go while Oliver talked to mrs. Bedwin Rose
2:11:40
asked mr. Brownlow if she could speak to him privately he led her into another room and there listened with a good deal
2:11:47
of amazement to Rose his account of her extraordinary conversation with Nancy between them they decided that mrs.
2:11:54
maylie and dr. losberne should be told and that mr. Brownlow would come to the hotel that evening for a discussion for
2:12:01
the moment nothing would be said to Oliver himself that evening at the hotel Oliver's four
2:12:08
friends met as arranged dr. losberne of course was full of immediate plans to rush round London arresting all the gang
2:12:15
and hanging them at once mr. Brownlow fortunately was able to persuade him to abandon this wild idea
2:12:23
then what stupid Aden cried the doctor impatiently first said Mr Brownlow calmly we must
2:12:30
discover who Oliver's parents were then if this girl's story is true we must
2:12:37
regain the inheritance that should have been his yes yes said the doctor nodding an
2:12:43
agreement but how shall we achieve these aims we must find this man monks said mr.
2:12:50
brownlow Nancy will not betray the man who is special to her but she will surely agree
2:12:56
to tell us how or where to find monks then we must find a way to force monks
2:13:01
to talk we must be both cautious and clever after all we have no proof
2:13:08
against him and if we cannot make him talk this mystery will never be solved but we'll have to wait five days until
2:13:15
Sunday before we can meet Nancy on London Bridge until then we can do nothing
2:13:24
[Music] Chapter 12 Nancy keeps an appointment
2:13:32
on exactly the same night as Nancy had met Rose Maylie two people from Oliver's
2:13:37
hometown were making their way towards London their progress was slow since
2:13:43
they traveled on foot and in addition the girl was carrying a heavy bag on her back the young man carried nothing
2:13:50
from time to time he turned to shout at the girl behind him hurry up what a lazy
2:13:56
creature you are Charlotte I'll come and give you a kick if you don't move faster the young man was noah claypole who had
2:14:03
made Oliver's life so miserable that mr. sowerberry's house he was now taller and
2:14:08
uglier but otherwise little changed he and Charlotte had grown tired of the
2:14:13
undertaking business and had set off to London to start a new life with all the money from mr. Sowerberry shop in their
2:14:20
pockets eventually they entered London and Noah began to look for a quiet cheap pub
2:14:27
where they could spend the night Charlotte followed obediently at his heels as they walked through a district
2:14:33
of narrow dirty streets at last Noah found a pub that he thought
2:14:38
was suitable it was dark and dirty with a few rough looking men in the bar
2:14:44
they entered and asked for the room for the night and a meal of cold meat and beer which they ate in the bar
2:14:51
the beer made Noah talked ative and he began to boast so it's now more coffins for us my girl
2:14:58
we can do better than just robbing mr. Sowerberry in London there are pockets houses coaches even banks I
2:15:06
like the sound of it now about how we're going to do all this asked Charlotte we
2:15:12
can meet people who know about these things I'd like to be the leader of some gang if there's a good profit to be made
2:15:18
in that kind of work Noah felt very pleased with himself and looked forward to an easy life of crime
2:15:25
in the capital they talked about their plans for a few minutes then a stranger who had been
2:15:33
sitting unseen round the corner came up to them the stranger was Fagin
2:15:38
he greeted them in a very friendly and cheerful way sat down with them and
2:15:43
immediately ordered more beer for Noah that's good beer said Noah already a
2:15:50
little drunk he thanked the stranger for the drink expensive too said Fagin if you drink
2:15:59
that every day my dear you will need to empty pockets houses coaches even
2:16:05
banks when he heard his own words repeated Noah went pale with terror the stranger
2:16:14
must have heard everything even how they had robbed mr. Sowerberry don't well he
2:16:20
laughed Fagin pulling his chair closer you're lucky it was only me who heard
2:16:25
you I didn't take it said no how quickly it was the woman who did it it doesn't
2:16:32
matter who did it my dear replied Fagin looking quickly at Charlotte because I'm
2:16:38
in that business myself and the people in my house as well I can introduce you
2:16:44
to the right people if you're interested you both look like good workers
2:16:49
Charlotte and Noah felt a mixture of fear and pleasure what would you want me to do asked Noah
2:16:57
light if possible he added what about spying on people asked Fagin
2:17:04
all robbing young children who are going shopping for their mothers that's light work and easy
2:17:10
Noah laughed that sounds like just a thing for me and what will I earn for this work you can
2:17:18
live free in my house and give me half of what you earn after further discussion and the
2:17:25
transfer of mr. Sauber his money from Noah's pocket to Fagin's agreement was reached the next day Noah and Charlotte
2:17:33
went to live in Fagin's house and began to be instructed in their new profession
2:17:39
although training and experience had made Nancy an expert liar she could not
2:17:45
completely hide the fear in her mind she knew she had taken an enormous risk
2:17:50
in going to see Rose Maylie if faking or Sikes ever found out but she pushed
2:17:56
these fears away she was determined to keep her promise to Rose Maylie and meet
2:18:02
her as arranged on the first Sunday night after her meeting with Rose she was in Sykes room
2:18:08
when the clock struck eleven Fagin was there to discussing some business with Sikes Nancy stood up and
2:18:16
put on her coat Sikes watched her surprised
2:18:21
Nancy where are you going at this time of night not far what kind of answer is
2:18:28
that where are you going I don't know replied the girl then I do
2:18:34
know where sit down I'm not well I want
2:18:39
a breath of air Sikes got up and locked the door let me go said the girl with great force
2:18:48
just for one hour let me go Sikes seized her arms roughly the girls
2:18:54
gone mad Nancy fought wildly and Sikes had to hold her down in a chair she continued
2:19:01
to scream and fight until midnight when exhausted and tearful she stopped struggling she went into another room
2:19:08
and threw herself on a bed she's a strange girl sike said to Fagin
2:19:14
shaking his head why did she suddenly decide to go out tonight I thought that
2:19:20
after all these years I'd finally tamed her she must be ill perhaps she still got a bit of fever
2:19:27
that must be it said Fagin nodding thoughtfully as
2:19:34
he walked home Fagin's eyes were sharp with suspicion he had suspected for a
2:19:40
while that Nancy had become tired of Bill Sikes brutality and violence and that she had found a new friend to take
2:19:46
his place her manner was different she often left home alone and she seemed less
2:19:52
interested in the gang and tonight her desperate impatience to go out at a
2:19:58
particular hour he was certain he was right he began to
2:20:03
make plans thirst he wanted to know who Nancy's new friend was he could make him a valuable
2:20:11
new member of the gang with Nancy as his assistant but there was another darker reason
2:20:17
Fagin too had become tired of Sikes Sikes knew too much too many dangerous
2:20:23
secrets about Fagin himself Fagin distrusted everybody but he hated and
2:20:28
distrusted Sikes most of all it would be very convenient if Sikes could be
2:20:33
removed with a little persuasion Fagin thought
2:20:39
perhaps the girl would poison Sikes suddenly his eyes narrowed in delight he
2:20:47
is first I must have her watched and find out who her new manis then I shall
2:20:53
threaten to tell Sikes everything she knows that neither she nor her new man will ever be safe from Sikes violent
2:21:00
jealousy she will have no choice except to do as I ask her and then once the
2:21:07
murder is done she will be in my power forever early next morning Fagin called the
2:21:14
newest member of his gang Noah was doing very well he had already brought home quite a lot of money he had
2:21:22
found that robbing small shield was indeed light easy work and he was proud of his success I
2:21:28
have another job for you now Fagin told him it needs great care and secrecy I
2:21:35
want you to follow a woman I want to know where she goes who she sees and if
2:21:42
possible what she says I will pay you a pound for this information
2:21:48
no his eyes were wide with greed I'm the right man for this job
2:21:54
who is she one of us what you don't
2:21:59
trust her then exactly so my dear exactly so smiled Fagin
2:22:09
the following Sunday soon after eleven o'clock a woman walked quickly through
2:22:15
the dark streets towards London Bridge a mist hung over the river and the
2:22:20
buildings on the far bank could hardly be seen a man followed some distance behind her
2:22:26
keeping to the darkest shadows it was a cold damp night and there were very few
2:22:31
people on the streets at this late hour when the woman reached the center of the bridge she stopped and looked around
2:22:38
anxiously the man following her stopped to the heavy bell of st. Paul's
2:22:44
Cathedral rang out announcing the death of another day just as it finished a
2:22:50
grey haired man and a young woman got out of a coach and walked across the
2:22:55
bridge they met the woman who took them down some steps leading to the riverbank they stood in deep shadow by the wall of
2:23:02
the bridge the man hurried down some other steps crept up to the corner of the wall and
2:23:08
listened Nancy spoke first I'm so frightened
2:23:14
tonight I can hardly breathe frightened of what asked mr. Brownlow he
2:23:20
seemed to pity her I wish I knew horrible thoughts of death and blood
2:23:26
have been with me all day I don't know why speak to her kindly said rose to mr.
2:23:33
Brownlow poor girl she seems to need it I couldn't come last Sunday continued
2:23:39
the girl I was kept in by force but tonight he'll be out all night until daylight now before I tell you anything
2:23:46
else I must tell you that I don't want faking or any of the other members of the gang to be handed to the police why
2:23:54
not because I couldn't betray them they've been loyal to me and asked a
2:24:00
loyal to them then just tell us how we can get monks and I promise none of your friends will
2:24:06
be harmed said mr. brownlow a monks will never know how you found out
2:24:12
about him she asked we promise said Rose gently
2:24:18
Nancy then told them in so low a voice that the listener round the corner could hardly hear her where monks often went
2:24:25
for a drink and what he looked like she finished by saying
2:24:31
on his throat high up there is a bright red mark asked mr. Brownlow
2:24:38
do you know him ask Nancy in surprise I think I do
2:24:45
mr. Brownlow murmured to himself it must be him
2:24:50
then more loudly he said to Nancy thank you for everything you've told us but
2:24:56
now how can you go back to these people come with us now tonight we can arrange
2:25:01
for you to be hidden from them all forever if you want us to the girl shook her head I'm chained to
2:25:09
him bad as they are I've gone too far to change my life now
2:25:15
she looked nervously over her shoulder I can feel those dreadful terrors again
2:25:20
visions of blood and death I must go home mr. Brownlow and Rose could not persuade
2:25:28
her to change her mind sadly they turned to leave and when they had gone Nancy fell to the ground in a
2:25:35
storm of tears meanwhile Noah Claypole amazed by all
2:25:40
that he had heard crept up the steps and ran for Fagin's house as fast as his legs could carry him
2:25:48
some hours later nearly two hours before dawn Noah lay asleep in Fagin's house
2:25:54
but Fagin sat silently by a dead fire staring at the flame of a candle on the
2:26:00
table beside him with his pale wrinkled face and his red staring eyes he looked
2:26:07
like a devil out of hell hatred ran like poison through his every thought
2:26:12
hatred for the girl who had dared to talk to strangers who had ruined his plan to get rid of Sikes he did not
2:26:20
believe her promise not to betray him and he feared that he would now be caught and hung
2:26:26
just before dawn Sikes entered the room carrying a bundle which contained the results of his night's work
2:26:33
Fagin took what Sikes gave him then stared at the robber for a long time
2:26:38
without speaking why are you looking at me like that asked Sikes uneasy at the old man's
2:26:45
strange expression Fagin raised his hand but his passion was so great that he could not speak say
2:26:53
he something will you shouted Sikes placing his huge hand on Fagin's collar and shaking him in his anger and fear
2:27:00
open your mouth and say what you've got to say eventually Fagin found his voice
2:27:07
bill what would you do if one of the gang
2:27:12
went out at night and told someone all about us and what we done what would you
2:27:19
do to him I'd smash his head into little pieces said the robber swearing
2:27:25
violently and what if it was me who knows so much about all of us and could
2:27:32
put us all in prison and get us all hanged whispered Fagin his eyes flashing with
2:27:38
hate I'd beat your brains out in public even in a law called I'd run over and
2:27:45
kill you with my bare hands said Sikes showing his teeth in his anger I don't
2:27:51
care who it was that's what I do Fagin woke Noah
2:27:57
tell bill what you told me what you saw what she did tell him
2:28:05
Noah rubbed the sleep from his eyes and told Sykes everything his face white
2:28:12
with passion Sykes listened to the end then swearing furiously he rushed from
2:28:18
the room and down the stairs bill Fagan called after him you won't be
2:28:24
too violent Sikes made no reply but pulling open the
2:28:31
door ran out into the silent streets he did not turn his head to right or left but look straight in front of him with
2:28:38
wild determination he ran at great speed his eyes on fire his teeth typed
2:28:44
together and did not pause until he reached his own door he ran up to his room entered and locked the door put a
2:28:52
table against it then woke Nancy bill she said please to see him but when
2:29:01
she saw his expression the colour went out of her face what's the matter she said in alarm
2:29:10
you know what Sikes took out his gun but realising
2:29:17
even in his madness that a shot might be heard he beat her twice across the face with it as hard as he could she fell
2:29:24
with a low cry of pain and terror almost blinded by the blood that flowed from
2:29:30
the cut on her forehead the murderer staggered to a corner seized a heavy
2:29:35
stick and struck her down [Music]
2:29:43
chapter 13 the end of the gang
2:29:48
the Sun burst upon the crowded city in all its brightness it lit up every
2:29:54
corner of London the great houses of the rich and the miserable homes of the poor
2:29:59
it shone everywhere even into the room where the murdered woman lay the horror
2:30:05
of that scene was even more dreadful in the clear morning light sike sat there unable to move looking at
2:30:14
the body he had thrown the blood-covered stick into the fire then washed himself and
2:30:20
his clothes he had cut out the bits of his clothes that was stained and burnt them too but
2:30:27
there was still blood stains all over the floor even the dog's feet were bloody
2:30:33
finally he forced himself to leave the room pulling the dog out with him and locking the door behind him he walked
2:30:40
rapidly north towards Highgate then on to Hampstead on the open land of Hampstead Heath away from people and
2:30:48
houses he found a place in a field where he could sleep without being disturbed
2:30:54
but before long he was up again and running this time he ran back towards
2:30:59
London for a while then he turned and went north again sometimes walking sometimes running with no clear purpose
2:31:06
in his mind eventually he felt hungry and changed direction towards Hendon a quiet place
2:31:14
away from the crowds where he could buy food but even the children and chickens
2:31:19
there seemed to look at him with suspicion so he turned back towards Hampstead
2:31:24
Heath again without having eaten uncertain where to go
2:31:30
at last he turned north again his dogs still running at his heels and set off
2:31:36
to a village just outside London he stopped at a small quiet pub and bought a meal then went on again it was now
2:31:44
dark and as he continued walking he felt as if Nancy were following him a shadow
2:31:50
on the road a last low cry in the wind if he stopped the ghostly figure did the
2:31:56
same if he ran it ran too moving stiffly like a corpse sometimes he turned
2:32:02
determined to drive the ghost away but his blood ran cold with terror every
2:32:08
time he turned the ghost turned - and was still behind him
2:32:15
finally he found another field where he could hide he lay down unable to sleep
2:32:20
his mind filled with visions of the dead girl her wide dead eyes stared at him
2:32:26
watching him through a curtain of blood suddenly he heard shouting in the
2:32:32
distance he jumped to his feet and saw that the sky seemed on fire sheets of
2:32:37
flame shot into the air driving clouds of smoke in his direction he heard an
2:32:42
alarm bell and more shouts of fire running with his dog across the fields
2:32:48
he joined the crowds of men and women fighting the fire he could forget his own terror in this new danger and he
2:32:54
worked all night with the crowd shouting running and working together to stop the flames destroying more buildings
2:33:00
in the morning the mad excitement was over and the dreadful memory of his
2:33:06
crime returned more terrifying than ever in desperation he decided to go back to
2:33:12
London at least there'll be somebody I can speak to her he thought to himself and
2:33:18
it's a better hiding place than out here in the country I lied there for a week get some money out of Fagin then escaped
2:33:25
to France suddenly he remembered the dog people
2:33:30
would be looking for his dog as well as himself he decided to drown the animal but the
2:33:37
dog smelled the man's fear and turned and ran away from him faster than it had ever run in its life you
2:33:44
have a choice mr. monks said mr. brownlow you have been kidnapped and
2:33:50
brought here to my house you can either tell me what I want to know or I'll have you arrested instantly for fraud and
2:33:57
robbery it's your choice and you must decide now at once
2:34:03
monks has it and looked at the old man but mr. Brownlow's expression was so serious and determined that the younger
2:34:10
man realized it was pointless to protest I didn't expect this treatment from my
2:34:15
father's old as friend said monks angrily sitting down with a frown on his face yes I was your father's oldest
2:34:22
friend said mr. brownlow and I know all about YOU how your father while still a
2:34:29
boy was forced by his family into an unhappy marriage with an older woman and how you were the result of that marriage
2:34:35
I also know that your parents separated hating each other by the end well what's
2:34:42
so important about that when they'd been separated for ten years
2:34:47
said mr. brownlow your father met another family there were two daughters
2:34:53
one 19 years old and the other them only two or three your father became engaged to the older
2:35:00
daughter at this point one of his rich relations died and left him a lot of money in his will your father had to
2:35:08
travel to Italy to receive his inheritance and while there he became ill and died
2:35:14
your mother who was living with you in Paris immediately rushed to Italy when
2:35:19
she heard the news as your father had made no will of his own all the relations money came to you and her
2:35:27
monks listened with close attention biting his lip and staring at the floor
2:35:32
before your father went to receive that money he came to see me continued mr.
2:35:38
Brownlow slowly his eyes fixed on monks face I never heard that before said monks
2:35:45
looking up suddenly a suspicious expression on his face he left me a picture of the poor girl he
2:35:53
wanted to marry he talked wildly about shame and guilt and how he would give
2:35:59
part of the money he'd inherited to his wife and to you and use the rest to escape from England with the girl he
2:36:05
loved he refused to tell me any more details monks breathed more easily and even
2:36:13
smiled but mr. brownlow pulling his chair nearer to
2:36:18
the other man by chance I was able to rescue your brother Oliver from a life
2:36:24
of misery and what cried monks mr. Brownlow continued without a pause
2:36:30
and when he was recovering from his sickness here in my house I noticed how
2:36:35
similar he looked to the girl's face in the picture but he was taken away before
2:36:40
I could discover his history as you know very well you can't prove anything said monks I
2:36:48
can I heard that you were in the West Indies I went there to try and find you to see if
2:36:55
you knew anything about Oliver but you'd already left I returned to London and was unable to find you until two hours
2:37:02
ago and now what you can't prove that Oliver's my brother monks smiled
2:37:08
unpleasantly I couldn't before said Mr Brownlow standing up but now I can there was a
2:37:17
will but your mother destroyed it this will mentioned a child that would be
2:37:22
born later this was Oliver the child you met later by accident you noticed his
2:37:28
resemblance to your father and you became suspicious you then went back to his birthplace found proof of his birth
2:37:34
and the fact that he's your half-brother and destroyed that proof monks sat in silence his eyes filled
2:37:42
with fear yes continued mr. Brownlow fiercely shadows on the wall have caught
2:37:48
your whispers with Fagin and brought them to my ear for the sake of that innocent child whom you wanted to
2:37:55
destroy and now murder has been done and you are as
2:38:00
guilty of that as if you had struck the blow yourself no no said monks quickly I
2:38:06
knew nothing of that nothing at all he was silent for a while
2:38:11
realising how much was known about him hatred and fear fought inside him but he
2:38:17
was a coward at heart at last seeing no escape he raised his head I
2:38:24
will admit everything in front of witnesses if necessary
2:38:30
mr. brownlow nodded coldly I will prepare a document for you to sign
2:38:37
you must give Oliver what is really his and then you can go where you please
2:38:42
at that moment dr. losberne rushed into the room the murder will be taken tonight his
2:38:49
dog's been found and Fagin asked mr. Brownlow they're sure of
2:38:54
him they may have him already mr. Brownlow turned back to monk's have
2:39:00
you made up your mind yes replied monks and you promise it'll
2:39:07
remain a secret no police or charges of fraud against me yes said Mr Brownlow
2:39:14
you have my promise for now you must remain here locked in this room I will
2:39:20
come for you tomorrow evening and take you to sign a confession in front of witnesses mr. Brownlow then left the room with the
2:39:28
doctor and they eagerly discussed the news of the hunt for the criminals my blood boils with anger said Mr Brownlow
2:39:36
this poor murdered girl must be revenged now you stay here and guard monks I'll
2:39:42
go out and get the latest news the two men parted each in a fever of excitement
2:39:50
down by the river Thames was a district called rava highs one of the dirtiest
2:39:56
and roughest places in London the houses next to the river had no owners they
2:40:01
were broken down and ruined but could be defended against attack in an upper room
2:40:06
of one of these houses were three members of Fagin's gang when was Fagin taken then asked a man
2:40:14
called Toby two o'clock this afternoon Charlie and I escaped up the chimney but
2:40:19
Noah was caught Bette went to see nan seein when she saw the body she started
2:40:25
screaming and wouldn't stop she's been taken to hospital what's happened to Charley Bates he'll
2:40:31
come here when it's dark it's too dangerous now we are in trouble said Toby
2:40:38
Hagen's going to hang that certain you should have seen him when he was caught said another robber the police carried
2:40:45
him through the crowd while all the people jumped head him screaming and trying to attack him suddenly Sikes dog
2:40:52
ran into the room all the robbers rushed out immediately to look for Sikes but
2:40:57
there was no sign of him they returned to the upstairs room I hope he's not coming here said Toby
2:41:06
the dogs come a long way said another man covered in mud and tired out
2:41:12
they sat there in silence wondering where Sikes was it was already dark when
2:41:18
they heard a sudden hurried knock at the door downstairs Toby went to the window to look down
2:41:23
then pulled his head back his face pale with fear there was no need to tell the others who it was
2:41:30
we must let him in said Toby although none of them wanted to see him
2:41:35
Toby went down to the door and returned followed by Sikes white faced with a three-day-old beard
2:41:42
hollow cheeks and staring eyes Sikes looked like a ghost no one said a word
2:41:50
nothing to say to me Sikes asked the only answer was a low shout of many
2:41:58
voices from outside in the distance coming closer lights appeared looking
2:42:03
out Sikes saw a stream of people crossing the bridge towards them then there was a loud knocking on the door
2:42:08
and more shouts from the crowd the door was a made of metal and there locked and chained said Toby the three
2:42:16
robbers watched Sikes nervously as if he were a wild animal bring a ladder shouted some of a crowd
2:42:22
below give me a rope quick Sikes said to the others I'll go the other way climb
2:42:27
down the back and escape over the river get me a rope now or I'll do three more murders a minute later Sikes appeared on
2:42:35
the roof and the shouts from the crowd below swelled to a great roar then the front door was smashed down and people
2:42:41
streamed into the house Sikes quickly tied the rope around the chimney then
2:42:46
began to tie the other end around himself ready to lower himself to the ground behind house but just as he put
2:42:53
the rope over his head he screamed in terror and threw his arms above his head he staggered back slipped and fell over
2:43:01
the edge of the roof as he fell the Rope tightened around his neck with a horrible jerk in a second the murderer
2:43:09
was dead and there he hung his body is swinging gently from side to side
2:43:16
the dog which had followed his master onto the roof jumped down towards the
2:43:21
lifeless body missed and fell dead on the stones below
2:43:29
[Music] chapter 14 the end of the mystery
2:43:38
the next day Oliver traveled with mr. Brownlow dr. losberne mrs. Maylie and
2:43:44
rose back to his birthplace he had been told a little of his history and knew that there would be more
2:43:50
explanations at the end of this journey he was anxious and uncertain wondering
2:43:55
what he would hear but towards the end of the journey he began to recognize familiar places and
2:44:02
in great excitement pointed them out to Rose there was the path he had taken
2:44:07
when he had run away there across the fields was the baby farm then as they
2:44:13
drove into the town he saw the house of mr. Sowerberry the Undertaker and the workhouse that had been his prison
2:44:20
they stopped to the biggest Hotel in the town and went into their rooms
2:44:26
during dinner mr. Brownlow stayed in a separate room and the older members of
2:44:31
the group went in and out with serious faces mrs. Maylie came back with her eyes red
2:44:36
from crying all this made Rose and Oliver who had not been told any new secrets very nervous and uncomfortable
2:44:45
at nine o'clock doctor losberne and mr. Brownlow brought monks into the room
2:44:50
Oliver was very surprised this was the same man he had bumped into once outside
2:44:55
a pub and seen another time with Fagin looking in at him through the window of the country cottage
2:45:02
Oliver was told that monks was his half-brother and the boys stared at him in shock and amazement monks looked back
2:45:10
at him with hatred we have the whole story here in these papers said Mr Brownlow putting them on
2:45:17
the table all we need now is for you to sign them monks and to tell Oliver what
2:45:24
happened monks started hesitantly my father had arrived in Italy to
2:45:32
collect the money he had inherited when suddenly fell ill when he died we found two papers in his
2:45:39
desk one was a letter to his girl the other was will
2:45:45
what was the letter asked mr. brownlow it was written when he was ill telling
2:45:52
the girl how ashamed he was that she was pregnant he asked her not to remember him as a bad man but as someone who had
2:45:58
made a mistake he reminded her of the day he'd given her the locket and ring
2:46:04
Oliver's tears fell fast as he listened to the story of his father and what
2:46:09
about the will asked mr. Brownlow monks was silent the will continued mr.
2:46:17
Brownlow speaking for him was in the same spirit as the letter he talked to
2:46:22
the misery of his marriage to his wife and the evil character of you monks his only son who had been brought up by your
2:46:29
mother to hate him he left you and your mother an annual income of 800 pounds
2:46:34
the rest of his property he left to his girl Agnes and to their child if it were
2:46:40
born alive and if it showed itself to be of a good kind character the money would
2:46:45
only go to you monks as the older son if the younger turned out to be as evil as
2:46:50
you my mother said monks but burnt this will
2:46:56
and never sent the letter the girl Agnes left her home in secret so that her pregnancy would not bring shame on her
2:47:02
family I swore to my mother when she was dying that if I ever found my
2:47:08
half-brother I would do him all the harm I could he would feel my hatred like a
2:47:14
whip on his back I paid Fagin to trap Oliver into a life of
2:47:20
crime but then he escaped and that stupid interfering girl Nancy to you if
2:47:27
I'd had the chance I would have finished what I'd begun monks stared at Oliver and his lips
2:47:33
moved in a silent curse and the locket and ring asked mr. Brownlow I
2:47:41
bought them from mr. and mrs. bumble who had stolen them from the nurse who had stolen them from agnese the dead girl
2:47:48
I've already told you how I threw them into the river mr. Brownlow turn to Rose I have one
2:47:56
more thing to explain he said to the girl I don't know if I have the strength to
2:48:03
hear it now she murmured having heard so much already mr. Brownlow put his hand under her arm
2:48:10
you have a great deal of courage dear child he said kindly he turned to monks
2:48:17
do you know this young lady sir yes I
2:48:24
don't know you who said Rose faintly the father of poor Agnes had two daughters
2:48:31
said Mr Brownlow what happened to the other one who was only a young child at the time
2:48:39
when Agnes disappeared replied monks her father changed his name and moved to a
2:48:45
lonely place in Wales where no one would know about the family shame he died very soon afterwards and this
2:48:53
young daughter was taken in by some poor people my mother hated Agnes and everybody
2:48:59
connected with her she hunted for this young sister and made sure that her life
2:49:04
would be unhappy she told the poor people who had taken her in that the girl was illegitimate and that she came
2:49:11
from a bad family with an evil reputation so the child had a life of miserable poverty until mrs. maylie saw
2:49:19
her by chance pitied her and took her home and do you see this young sister now asked
2:49:27
mr. Brownlow yes standing by your side
2:49:33
Rose could hardly speak so Oliver is my nephew I
2:49:40
can never call you aunt cried Oliver you'll always be my own dear sister they
2:49:48
ran into each other's arms both of them crying in their happiness a father sister and mother had been lost and
2:49:56
gained and it was too much for one evening they stood for a long time in
2:50:02
silence and the others left them alone the court was full of faces from every
2:50:10
corner all eyes were on one man Fagin in front of him behind above below
2:50:18
he seemed surrounded by staring eyes not one of the faces showed any sympathy
2:50:23
towards him all were determined that he should hang at last there was a cry of
2:50:29
silence and everyone looked towards the door the jury returned and passed close
2:50:35
to Fagin he could tell nothing from their faces they could have been made of stone
2:50:41
then there was complete stillness not a whisper not a breath
2:50:47
guilty the whole court rang with a great shout
2:50:52
echoing through all the rooms as the crowd ran out of the building to tell all the people waiting outside the news
2:50:59
was that he would die on Monday Fagin thought of nothing but death that
2:51:06
night he began to remember all the people he had ever known who had been hanged he could hardly count them they
2:51:14
might have sat in the same prison cell as he was now he thought about death by
2:51:19
hanging the rope the cloth bag over the head the sudden change from strong men
2:51:25
to bundles of clothes hanging at the end of a rope as his last night came despair seized
2:51:33
Fagin's evil soul he could not sit still and hurried up
2:51:39
and down his small cell gasping with terror his eyes flashing with hate and anger then he lay trembling on his stone
2:51:47
bed and listened to the clock striking the hours where would he be when those hours came round again
2:51:54
in the middle of that Sunday night mr. Brownlow and Oliver were allowed to enter the prison
2:52:00
several strong doors were unlocked and eventually they entered Fagin cell the
2:52:06
old rubber was sitting on the bed whispering to himself his face more like a trapped animals than a human's
2:52:14
you have some papers Hagan said mr. brownlow quietly which were given to you
2:52:20
by monks to look after it's a lie replied fagin not looking at him I
2:52:26
haven't got any for the love of God said mr. brownlow very seriously don't lie to
2:52:33
us now on the night before your death you know that Sykes is dead and monks has confessed where are the papers
2:52:42
I'll tell you Oliver said Fagin come here he whispered to him there in a bag
2:52:51
up the chimney in the front room at the top of the house but I want to talk to
2:52:57
you my dear yes said Oliver will you pray with me
2:53:04
outside outside said Fagin pushing the boy in front of him towards the door say
2:53:10
I've gone to sleep they'll believe you you can take me out with you when you go the old man's eyes shone with a mad
2:53:17
light it's no good said Mr Brownlow taking all of his hand he's gone too far and we can
2:53:25
never reach him now the cell door opened and as the visitors
2:53:30
left Fagin started struggling and fighting with his guards screaming so loudly that the prison walls rang with a
2:53:37
sound they left the prison building in the gray light of dawn
2:53:42
outside in the street huge crowds were already gathering joking and laughing
2:53:47
and pushing to get the best places near the great black platform where the Rope hung ready for its morning's work
2:53:56
less than three months later Rose married Harry Maylie for her sake Harry
2:54:03
had abandoned his political ambitions and had become a simple man of the church there was no longer any mystery
2:54:09
about Rosie's birth but even if there had been Harry would not have cared they
2:54:14
lived next to the church in a peaceful village mrs. maylie went to live with them and spent the rest of her days in
2:54:21
quiet contentment mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son
2:54:26
they moved to a house in the same quiet village and were just as happy
2:54:31
dr. losberne discovered suddenly that the air in Chertsey did not suit him in
2:54:37
less than three months he too had moved to a cottage just outside the village where he took up gardening and fishing
2:54:43
with great energy and enthusiasm mr. Brownlow suggested that half the
2:54:49
remaining money from the will should be given to monks and the other half to Oliver although by law it should all
2:54:55
have gone to Oliver alone Oliver was glad to accept the suggestion monks went off with his money to the
2:55:02
other side of the world where he spent it quickly and was soon in prison for another act of fraud in prison he became
2:55:09
ill and died the remaining members of Fagin's gang died in similar ways in other distant
2:55:16
countries all except Charlie Bates who turned his back on his past life of crime and lived honestly as a farmer
2:55:24
Noah Claypole was given a free pardon for telling the police about Fagin he
2:55:30
soon became employed as an informer for the police spying on people and telling the police about anyone who had broken
2:55:35
the law mr. and mrs. bumble lost their jobs and became poorer and poorer
2:55:41
eventually living in poverty in the same workhouse that they had once managed
2:55:47
in that quiet country village the years passed peacefully mr. Brownlow filled
2:55:53
the mind of his adopted son with knowledge and as he watched the boy grow up he was reminded more and more of his
2:55:59
old friend Oliver's father the two orphans rose and Oliver led lives that
2:56:05
were truly happy the hardships that they had once suffered had left no bitterness
2:56:10
in their gentle souls and all their lives they showed the mercy and kindness to others that God himself chose to all
2:56:18
things that breathe
