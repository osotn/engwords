Yamashita Electronics, Koichi Sata speaking.
Hello, Koichi, this is Bernard Klebermann. How are you?
Very well, thank you. How can I help?
We need some more sales literature. We're planning a big advertising campaign for your new laser printer, the HG903 model. And there's a lot of demand for your other products too, by the way.
Good.
Could you send some more brochures - 5,000 would be good - plus some updates price lists, the same amount? Also we need point-of-sales literature, especially posters - at least 200 - and, um, yes, some of those pens and pencils with the company logo on, also 50 or so of the bags that we give out at exhibitions.
OK, I don't know if I can remember all that ... can you ...
Good. Another thing, you might like to know, we've managed to get a big new customer, Seelmayer.
Seel- ... I don't think I know the company ...
We're very excited about it. They're a big restaurant chain. They've placed an order for 518 of the new lasers. Please tell your boss, Hideo. He'll be very pleased, I'm sure.
An order for 580 laser printers? Great! I'll let my boss know. He'll probably want to write to this company ... er .. Seelmund ..
Yes, please tell him to write to them. That'd be good PR. They're expanding very fast in Europe and they'll probably order some computers from us well. They're need some details about the company, an address and the right person to contact and ...
Sorry, Koichi, I can't hear you, it's an awful line. Anyway, nice talking to you. Speak to you soon.
