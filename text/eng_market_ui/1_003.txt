Do you think that in general companies are now communicating better
with their customers?
In general, I would say no, and I think there are, there are examples of
excellent communication and there are examples of awful communication.
If you think about two examples, perhaps, of companies who've used
technology to change the way they communicate with customers, one is
absolutely fantastic, the other is completed abysmal, awful.
The fantastic one I would say is Amazon. The thing about Amazon - you
always know where you are. You order something, you get a confirmation.
Um, as soon as it's been sent, you get another confirmation. So you
always feel exactly . . . you know exactly where you are. You know exactly
what's happening, when your thing's going to turn up - which anyone
could do, but most people don't. The other thing about Amazon is they
are, in a sense, listening to you because they're looking at the things
you've bought in the past and suggesting - well, based on that, there are
other things you might like. l think that's very effective communication.
It certainly resulted in me buying quite a lot more books than 1 otherwise
would. Or things like, you know, people who bought, other people who
bought this also buy that. That's, that's really good because again they
are using the opportunity of having you on this wonderful technological
platform where they don't just know what you buy they know everything
you've ever looked at - to tell you useful things. l think it's great because if
I want books on a particular subject, i t will suggest books I've never heard
of. And I'll buy them, so it's, it's good for them as well. So that works really well.
