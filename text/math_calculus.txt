Calculus
J.E. Thompson
=============

In arithmetic we study numbers with retain always a fixed value (constant).
The number studied in algebra may be constants or they may vary (variables),
but in any particular problem the numbers remain constant while a calculation
is being made.

Rates - the most natural illustration of a rate is that involving motion and time.

The speed or rate is simply x/t.

    Rate = (x' - x)/(t' - t) = dx/dt

    dx pronounces as "dee-ex" and dt as "dee-tee"

The differential dx of a variable quantity x at any instant is the change in x
which would occur in the next interval of time dt if x were to continue to change
uniformly in the interval dt with the same rate which it has the beginning of dt.

The quantities dx or ds and dt have been called the differentials of x.

The finding or calculation of differentials is called differentiation and is one
of the most important parts of the subject of calculus, that part of the subject
which deals with differentiation and its applications being called the
differential calculus.

Constant speed k:   dx/dt = k
        x = kt + a


    d(x + y)/dt = dx/dt + dy/dt
    d(x + x + ...) = dx + dx + ...
    d(mx) = mdx

Chapter II
Functions and derivatives

Function - in the solution of problems in algebra and trigonometry one of the
important steps is the expression of one quantity in terms of another.
The unknown quantity is found as soon as an equation or formula can be written
which contains the unknown quantity on one side of the equation and only known
quantities on the other.

If when x is given, y is determined, y is a function of x.

Functions:
    - algebraic;
    - transcendental:
        - trigonometric;
        - exponential;
        - logarithmic;

    dy = f'(x) dx

13. Differential of the square of a variable
--------------------------------------------
    z = m x,   z^2  = m^2   x^2
   dz = mdx, d(z^2) = m^2 d(x^2)

    d(x^2) = 2x dx
