8.02x - MIT Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism

Physics is beautiful.
Electricity and magnetism is all around us.

Light itself is an electromagnetic phenomenon as radio waves are.

Nucleus: p+ and n.
Mass of proton and neutron = 1.7 10^-27 kg

atom: nucleus and electron

nucleus = 10^-12 cm
atom    = 10^-8 cm

Electric fluid.

Conductor - metals

Friction.

     r
q1 <--> q2

v_r1,2 - vector to q2 from q1
v_F1,2 - force
v_F2,1

Coulomb

v_F1,2 = q1 q2 K v_r1,2 / r^2,  K= 9 10^9, K = 1/(4pi eps_0)
                                eps_0 = 

1 Coulomb (C), mC


q_p+ = q_e = 1,6 10^-19 C

Gravity = m1 m2 * G / r^2

Electro field
Q+     q

v_F = q Q K v_r / r^2

v_E = v_F/q = Q K v_r / r^2

Feynman Volume 2

Electrical force is about a billion billion billion times stronger than gravitation.
Gravity is only attraction, but electrical forces can be either repel or attract.

It mixture positive protons and negative electrons.

F (electric force) = q ( E (electric field ) + v B (magnetic field))

Flux of velocity through the surface   =  it just equal to the component of the
velocity perpendicular to the surface times the area of the surface.

But electric field is not the velocity of anything.
Electric flux.

The flux of E through any closed surface = the net charge inside / constant epsilon

Many physicists used to say that direct action with nothing in between was inconcievable.
