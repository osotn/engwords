Chapter 7 - Input and Output
Input and output are not part of the C language itself, so we have not emphasized them in our
presentation thus far. Nonetheless, programs interact with their environment in much more
complicated ways than those we have shown before. In this chapter we will describe the
standard library, a set of functions that provide input and output, string handling, storage
management, mathematical routines, and a variety of other services for C programs. We will
concentrate on input and output
The ANSI standard defines these library functions precisely, so that they can exist in
compatible form on any system where C exists. Programs that confine their system interactions
to facilities provided by the standard library can be moved from one system to another without
change.
The properties of library functions are specified in more than a dozen headers; we have already
seen several of these, including <stdio.h> , <string.h> , and <ctype.h> . We will not present
the entire library here, since we are more interested in writing C programs that use it. The
library is described in detail in Appendix B.
