Appendix B - Standard Library
This appendix is a summary of the library defined by the ANSI standard. The standard library
is not part of the C language proper, but an environment that supports standard C will provide
the function declarations and type and macro definitions of this library. We have omitted a few
functions that are of limited utility or easily synthesized from others; we have omitted multi-
byte characters; and we have omitted discussion of locale issues; that is, properties that depend
on local language, nationality, or culture.
The functions, types and macros of the standard library are declared in standard headers:
<assert.h>
<ctype.h>
<errno.h>
<float.h>
<limits.h>
<locale.h>
<math.h>
<setjmp.h>
<signal.h>
<stdarg.h>
<stddef.h>
<stdio.h>
<stdlib.h>
<string.h>
<time.h>
A header can be accessed by
#include <header>
Headers may be included in any order and any number of times. A header must be included
outside of any external declaration or definition and before any use of anything it declares. A
header need not be a source file.
External identifiers that begin with an underscore are reserved for use by the library, as are all
other identifiers that begin with an underscore and an upper-case letter or another underscore.
