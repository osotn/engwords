Two choice:
	- use the functions written by the vendor to access the peripherals.
	- access the peripheral special function registers directly using C language

Widely available compilers:
	- Keil
	- IAR

Ultra-low-power STM32L0,1,4 - 32..80MHz
Mainstream STM32F0,1,3 - 48..72MHz
High-performance STM32F2,4,7 , H7 0 120..400MHz

ST_LINK part = mini USB 



Development toolchain.
STM = STMicroelectronics

STM is a company that designs and manufacturers MCUs.
Nucleo - 32/64/144 - number of pins in MCU chip.

Processor is the ARM Cortex M-4 32-bit processor.
Cortex M4:
	- full featured ARMv7-M 
	- FPU
	- Low power 32 bit processor
	- MPU
	- NVIC (nested vector interrupt controller)
	- trace, breakpoint, JTAG
Has Harvard architecture.

ST LINK - SWD

NVIC - implemented both in hardware and software.
An interrupt is a disruption in the normal flow of a program initited by an external or temporal event.

ISR stands for interrupt service routine.
Save PC and some number of register (depends on MCU model).
Vector interrupt list.

NVIC:
	- preemption and interrupt nesting: can be preempted by an exception having a higher priority
	- tail chaining: 

Keil, IAR

In 1971 TI TMS1000 is the first microcontroller, had RAM, ROM and 8-bit processor and on-board clock.
Intel 8048.

Intel 8051 - EEPROM

Toolchain - to create and debug software run on a MCU.
Consists:
	- editor;
	- cross-compiler;
	- support libraries;
	- linker/loader
	- debugger
Most of the toolchain are often integrated into single application called IDE.


1. Arduino IDE
2. Keil
3. IAR
4. STMCube32MX

ST-LINK - software is the next part of the toolchain.
The USB ST-LINK driver.
OpenOCD - on chip debugger

STM32CubeMX - is free from STM.
CubeMX is a fairly complex utility because it is intended to encompass nearly all the MCUs
and development boards that STM offers and automatically generating C code that
developers can easily use in their programs:
	- select STM family
	- specific IP
	- ST HAL
	- external libraries


ARM Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS):
	ARM - IP to all the Cortex based MCUs, has created an interface standard that allows for efficient cross vendor software development.
