Whole numbers
-------------

Learning algebra is similar to learning a language.
Algebra uses numbers and symbols to represent words and ideas.

Counting = natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

... - ellipsis = and so on

Including zero with counting numbers gives a new set of numbers called the whole numbers.

Whole numbers = {0, counting numbers}

Our number system is called a place value system because the value of a digit
depends on its position, or place, in a number.
    374 = 300 + 70 + 4

The place values are separated into groups of three, called periods.
The periods are ones, thousands, millions, billions, trillions, and so on.
In a written number, commas separate the periods.

    37,519,248 is written thirty-seven million, five hundred nineteen thousand,
                          two hundred forty-eight.
Word and is not used when naming a whole number.

The process of approximating a number is called rounding.
Rounding to a specific place value depending on how much accuracy need.
If the number is less than 5, round down, else - round up.

The operation of addition combines numbers to get a sum.
                3 + 4
We read this as three plus four and the result is the sum of three and four.

A math statement that includes numbers and operations is called an expression.

Operation   : Addition
Notation    : +
Expression  : 3 + 4
Read as     : three plus four
Result      : the sum of 3 and 4

Addition is really counting.
We use an equal sign (=) to show the sum.

Adding table

+  0  1  2  3  4  5    6  7  8  9
0  0  1  2  3  4  5    6  7  8  9

! 6 + 7 = 13
! 6 + 8 = 14
! 7 + 8 = 15

It is important that you memorize any number facts you do not already know so that
you can quickly and reliably use the number facts when you add larger numbers.

Words        Example                Expression
-----        -------                ----------
plus         1 plus 2               1 + 2
sum          the sum of 3 and 4     3 + 4
increased by 5 increased by 6       5 + 6
more than    8 more than 7          7 + 8
total of     the total of 9 and 5   9 + 5
added to     6 added to 4           4 + 6

When we subtract, we take one number away from another to find the difference.
We read 7 - 3 as seven minus three and the result is the difference of seven and three.


Operation   : Subtraction
Notation    : -
Expression  : 3 - 4
Read as     : three minus four
Result      : the sum of 3 and 4

Addition and subtraction are inverse operations.
Addition undoes subtraction, and vice versa.

Words           Example                    Expression
-----           -------                    ----------
minus           5 minus 1                  5 - 1
difference      the difference of 9 and 4  9 - 4
decreased by    7 decreased by 3           7 - 3
less than       5 less than 8              8 - 5
subtracted from 1 subtracted from 6        6 - 1

Multiplication is a way to represent repeated addition.
We call each number being multiplied a factor and the result the product.
We read 3 x 8  as three times eight, and result as the product of three and eight.
There are several symbols that represent multiplication.
There include the symbol x as well as dot, and parentheses ().

Operation   : Multiplication
Notation  1 : x ∙ ()
Expression  : 3x8 3∙8 3(8)
Read as     : three times eight
Result      : the product of 3 and 8

Division is a way to represent repeated subtraction just as multiplication
represented addition.
We read this as twelve divided by four and result is the quotient of 12 and 4.
We call the number being divided the dividend and the number dividing it the
divisor.

Operation   : Division
Notation    : /
Expression  : 12 / 4
Read as     : twelve divided by four
Result      : the quotient of 12 and 4

Division is the inverse operation of multiplication.
Division by zero is undefined.

With remainder.
1439 / 4 = 359R3 , remainder equals 3.

In algebra, letters of the alphabet, often used for variables are x, y, a, b, and c.
A variable is a letter that represents a number or quantity whose value may change.
A constant is a number whose value always stays the same.

The symbol = is called the equal sign.
An inequality is used in algebra to compare two quantities that may have
different values.
a < b is read a is less than b
a > b is read a is greater than b

    =   is equal
    ≠   is not equal
    <   is less than
    >   is greater than
    ≤   is less than or equal to
    ≥   is greater than or equal to

Grouping symbols in algebra are much like the commas, colons, and other punctuation
marks in written language.
They indicate which expressions are to be kept together and separate from other
expressions.

    ()  parentheses
    []  brackets
    {}  braces

In algebra, we have expressions and equations. An expression is like a phrase.
An equation is like a sentence.

    3 + 5 =  8      The sum of three and five is equal to eight.
    n - 1 = 14      n minus one equals fourteen.
    6 x 7 = 42      The product of six and seven is equal to forty-two.
    x = 53          x is equal to fifty-three
    y + 9 = 2y - 3  y plus nine is equal two y minus three

An expression is a number, a variable, or a combination of numbers and variables
and operation symbols.
An equation is made up of two expressions connected by an equal sign.

To simplify a numerical expression means to do all the math possible.

Exponential notation is used in algebra to represent a quantity multiplied by
itself several times. In expressions such as 2^3, the 2 is called the base and
3 is called the exponent. The exponent tells us how many factors of the base we
have to multiply.
We say 2^3 is in exponential notation and 2 ∙ 2 ∙ 2 is in expanded notation.

For any expression a^n, a is a factor multiplied by itself n times if n is 
a positive integer. a^n means multiply n factors of a:
                    a^n = a ∙ a ∙ a ∙ ... ∙ a
                          -------------------
                              n factors

The expression a^n is read a to the n-th power.
               a^2 is read as a squared
               a^3 is read as a cubed

Established some guidelines called the order of operations, which outlines the
order in which parts of expression must be simplified.
    - parentheses and other grouping symbols;
    - exponents
    - Multiplication and Division
    - Addition and Subtraction

    P E M D A S = Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally

To evaluate an algebraic expression means to find the value of the expression
when the variable is replaced by a given number.

Algebraic expressions are made up of terms.
A term is a constant or the product of a constant and one or more variables.
The constant that multiplies the variable(s) in term is called the coefficient.
We can simplify an expression by combining the like terms.

To solve an equation is to determine the values of the variable that make the
equation a true statement.
Any number that makes the equation true is called a solution of the equation.

A solution to an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement
when substituted into the equation.
The process of finding the solution is called solving the equation.

An envelope represents the variable - since its contents are unknown - and
each counter represents one.

Addition property of equality: for any numbers a, b, and c, if a = b then
    a + c = b + c

Clue words that mean equals:
    -   is equal to
    -   is the same as
    -   is
    -   gives
    -   was
    -   will be

A multiple of a number is the product of the number and a counting number.
A number is a multiple of n if it is the product of a counting number and n.
If a number m is a multiple of n, then we say that m is divisible by n.

    8 x 9 = 72
    -----   ------
  factors   product

If a x b = m, then a and b are factors of m, and m is the product of a and b.

To determine all of the factors of a number is called factoring a number.

Some numbers, like 72, have many factors. Other numbers, such as 7, have only
two factors: 1 and the number.
A number with only two factors is called a prime number.
A number with more than two factors is called a composite number.

Prime factorization of a number - rewriting the number as a product of primes.
One way to find the prime factorization of a number is to make a factor tree.
If factor is prime, we circle it (like a bud on a tree).

LCM = Least Common Multiple
A common multiple of two numbers is a number that is a multiple of both numbers.
The smallest number is a multiple of two numbers is called the LCM.
To find the LCM of two numbers is to use their prime factors.
Now we bring down the primes in each column. The LCM is the product of these factors.

A negative number is a number that is less than 0.

Whole number = {Negative numbers + zero + positive numbers}

The opposite of a number is the number that is the same distance from zero on
the number line, but on the opposite side of zero.
    -a means the opposite of the number a.
    The notation -a is read the opposite of a.

Integers are counting number, their opposites, and zero:
    ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

The distance between 0 and any number on the number line is called the absolute
value of that number.
  |-5| = 5, |5|= 5
  |n| ≥ 0

Subtraction of signed numbers can be done by adding the opposite: a - b = a + (-b)

The sign of the product of two numbers depends on their signs:
    -   two positives       =   positive
    -   two negatives       =   positive
    -   positive/negative   =   negative
    -   negative/positive   =   negative

Subtraction property of equality: for any a, b, c: if a = b then a - c = b - c
Addition property of equality   : for any a, b, c: if a = b then a + c = b + c
Division property of equality   : for any a, b, c ≠ 0, if a = b then a/c = b/c

A fraction is written a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.
In a fraction, a is called the numerator and b is called denominator.
A fraction is a way to represent parts of a whole.

A mixed number consists of a whole number a and a fraction b/c where c ≠ 0.
It is written as follows: a b/c
The fraction a/b is a proper fraction if a < b and an improper fractin if a ≥ b.

Equivalent fractions are fractions that have the same value.
Equivalent fractions property: if a, b, and c, and b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0, then
        a/b = (ac)/(bc)

A fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors in the numerator
and denominator. It often called reducing the fraction.

Fraction Multiplication: if a, b, c, and d are numbers where b ≠ 0 and d ≠ 0, then
        (a/b)(c/d) = (ac)/(bd)

The reciprocal of the fraction a/b is b/a, where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0
A number and its reciprocal have product of 1.

In subtract whole number, we defined quotient as the result of division.
The quotient of a and b is the result you get from dividing a/b.
                 x
Fractional bar:  -
                 x

Fraction Addition: if a, b, and c are numbers where c ≠ 0, then
        (a/c) + (b/c) = (a+b)/c
To add fractions with a common denominators, add the numerators and place
the sum over the common denominator.

The least common denominator (LCD) of two fractions is the least common multiple (LCM)
of their denominators.

Complex fraction is a fraction in which the numerator or denominator contains a
fraction.

0.1      =      1/10      one tenth
0.01     =      1/100     one hundredth
0.001    =      1/1000    one thousandth

We read $5.03 as five dollars and three cents.
We read  5.03 as five and three hundredths.

To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator of the fraction by the
denominator of the fraction.

A repeating decimal is a decimal in which the last digit or group of digits
repeats endlessly.
    1.333... = 1.(3) - in book there is line above 3.

pi - symbolized by Greek letter π (pronounced pie). The exact value of π cannot
be calculated since the decimal never ends or repeats.
    π ≈ 3.14

The mean is often called the arithmetic average. It is computed by dividing
the sum of the values by the number of values.
The mean of a set of n numbers is the arithmetic average of the numbers.
        mean = (sum of values in data set)/n

The median of a set of data values is the middle value.
    -   Half the data values are less than or equal to the median
    -   Half the data values are greater than or equal to the median.

The average is one number in a set of numbers that is somehow typical of the
whole set of numbers. The mean and median are both often called the average.

The mode of a set of numbers is the number with the highest frequency.

The probability of an event tells us how likely that event is to occur.
    Probability of an event = (num of favorable outcomes)/(total num of outcomes)

A ratio compares two numbers of two quantities that are measured with the same
unit. The ratio of a to b is written a to b, a/b.

A rate compares two quantities of different units. A rate is usually written as
a fraction.
A unit rate is a rate with denominator of 1 unit.

Rate:       68 miles/1 hour
Write:      68 miles/hour
Abbreviate: 68 mph
Read:       68 miles per hour

A unit price is a unit rate that gives the price of one item.

If n^2 = m, then m is the square of n.

A perfect square is the square of a whole number.

A number whose square is m is called a square root of m.
If n^2 = m, then n is a square root of m.

Every positive number has two square roots:
    -   one positive
    -   one negative

 √ - radical sign.

√m is read as "the square root of m". If m = n^2, then √m = n for n ≥ 0
√ - radical sign, m - radicand

A percent is a ratio whose denominator is 100.

The sales tax is a percent of the purchase price:
    Sales Tax   =   Tax rate x Purchase Price
    Total Cost  =   Purchase Price x Sales Tax

A commission is a percentage of total sales as determined by the rate of commission:
    commission = rate of commission x total sales

An amount of discount is a percent off the original price:
    amount of discount  = discount rate x original price
            sale price  = original price - discount

The mark-up is the amount added to wholesale price.

The money you put in the bank is called the principal, P, and the bank pays
you interest, I. The interest is computed as a certain percent of the principal;
called the rate of interest, r.

If an amount of money, P, the principal, is invested for a period of t years at
an annual interest rate r, the amount of interest, I. earned is:
                    I   =   Prt
    I - interest, P - principal, r - rate, t - time.

A proportion is an equation of the form a/b = c/d, where b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0.
The proportion states two ratios or rates are equal.
The proportion is read "a is to b", as c is to d.
To determine if a proportion is true, we find the cross products of each proportion:
        a x d = b x c

A rational number is a number that can be written as ratio of two integers: p/q,
where p and q is integers and q ≠ 0.

An irrational number is a number that cannot be written as the ratio of two
integers. Its decimal form does not stop and does not repeat.

Rational + Irrational = Real numbers

Commutative property of addition: if a and b are real numbers, then: a + b = b + a
Commutative property of multiplication: if a and b are real numbers, then a x b = b x a
Associative property of addition: if a, b, and c are real numbers, then (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)

The most important topics in algebra is  " solving equations "
The applications are limitless and extend to all careers and fields.

A solution of an equation is a value of variable that makes a true statement 
when substituted into the equation.

The angle is formed by two rays that share a common endpoint.
Each ray is called a side of the angle and the common endpoint is called the vertex.
An angle is named by its vertex.
∠A is the angle with vertex at point A.
The measure of ∠A is written m∠A

We use the symbol ∘ to represent degrees.
We use abbreviation m to for the measure of an angle.
So if ∠A is 27∘, we would write m∠A = 27.
If the sum of the measure of two angles is 180∘, then they are called supplementary.

If ∠A  and ∠B are complementary, then m∠A + m∠B = 90∘

Triangle have three sides and three angles.
Triangles are named by their vertices.
The triangle is called ⊿ABC, read triagnle ABC.
    m∠A + m∠B + m∠C = 180∘

A right triangle has one 90∘ angle.

In geometry, if two figures have exactly same share but different sizes, we say
they are similar figures.

The Pythagorean Theorem is a special property of right triangles that has been used
since ancient times.
It is named after the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras who lived
around 500 BCE.
The side of the triangle opposite the 90∘ angle is called the hypotenuse, and
the other sides are called are legs.
The sum of the squares of two legs equals the square of the hypotenuse.
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Area is measured is square units.
Volume is measured in cubic units.

The perimeter is a measure of the distance around a figure.
The area is a measure of the surface covered by a figure.

Rectangle has four sides and for right angels.
The opposite sides of a rectangle are the same.
P = 2L + 2W
S = LW

We can divide this rectangle into two congruent triangles.
Triangle that are congruent have identical side lengths and angles,
and so their areas are equal.
A = (1/2)LW

To find the area of the triangle, you need to know its base and height.
The base is the length of one side of the triangle, usually the side of the
bottom.
The height is the length of the line that connects the base to the opposite vertex,
and makes 90∘ angle with the base.

A triangle with two sides of equal length is called an isosceles triangle.
A triangle that has three sides of equal length is called an equilateral triangle.

A trapezoid is four sided figure, a quadrilateral, with two sides that are parallel
and two sides that are not. The parallel sides are called the bases.
We call the length of the smaller base b, and the length of the bigger base B.
The height h.

S = (1/2)h(b + B)

Circles:
    r is the length of the radius

An angle AOB consists of two rays R1 and R2 with common vertex O.
Angle as a rotation of the ray R1 onto R2. In this case R1 is called the
initial side, and R2 is called the terminal side of the angle.
If the rotation is counterclockwise, the angle is considered positive, and if
the notation is clockwise, the angle is considered negative.

If a circle of radius 1 is drawn with the vertex of an angle at its center, then
the measure of this angle in radians (abbreviated rad) is the length of the arc

Many real world quantities are described mathematically by just one number: their
or magnitude:
    -   mass;
    -   volume;
    -   distance;
    -   temperature.
Such a quantity is called a scalar.
But many other real world quantities involve both magnitude and direction.
Such quantities are described mathematically by vectors:
    -   force
    -   speed
    -   displacement
Called directed quantities.

A vector in the plane is a line segment with an assigned direction.
We sketch a vector with an arrow to specify the direction.
vector ->AB, point A is the initial point, B is the terminal point.
AB is called the magnitude or length.
Two vectors are considered equal if they have equal magnitude and the same direction.

->v - vector
c - scalar
  ->vc - multiplication of a vector by a scalar.
  ->v (-1) - is the vector with the same length as v but with the opposite direction.
  ->u - ->v = ->u + (-1) -<v

v is ordered pair of real numbers.
->v = (a1, a2)
a1 - horizontal component, and a2 - vertical component

If a vector is represented in the plane with initial point P(x1, y1) and terminal
point Q(x2, y2), then ->v = (x2-x1, y2-y1) = (a1, a2)
        |v| = √(a1^2 + a2^2)

Zero vector O = (0, 0)
Unit vector i = (1, 0), j = (0, 1)

    v = (a1, a2) = a1 i + a2 j; Vector in terms of i and j.
    v = |v| cos(Q) i + |v| sin(Q) j

If u = (a1, a2) and v = (b1, b2) are vectors, then their dot product, denoted by
u * v, is defined by:
            u * v = a1b1 + a2b2  - it's scalar
            u * v = |u||v| cos(Q), Q - angle between two nonzero vectors

            cos(Q)  = (u * v)/(|u||v|)

            If u * v = 0 then u and v are perpendicular.

The component of u along v is defined to be |u| cos(Q)
             comp_v(u) = (u * v) / |v|

The projection of u onto v, denoted by proj_v(u), is the vector parallel to v
and whose length is the component of u along v.
            proj_v(u) = comp_v(u) * (unit vector in direction of v)  = 
              = ((u*v)/|v|)(v/|v|) = ((u*v)/(|v|)^2) v

In three dimensional space, a third dimension is added, so any point in space
is represented by an ordered triple (a, b, c) of real numbers.

Three coordinate planes divide space into eight parts, called octans: xy-plane, ...

    v = (a1, a2, a3) = a1 i + a2 j + a3 k, where ak are the components of v

Given two vectors u = (a1, a2, a3) and v = (b1, b2, b3), we often need to find
a vector w perpendicular to both u and v. If we write w = (c1, c2, c3), then
u * w = 0 and v * w = 0, so 
    a1c1 + a2c2 + a3c3 = 0
    b1c1 + b2c2 + b3c3 = 0

Solution is w = (a2b3 - a3b1, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1) is called the cross
product of u and v is denoted by u x v.

    |u x v| = |u||v| sin(Q)

The length of the cross product u x v is the area of the parallelogram determined
by u and v.

A line L in three dimensional space is determined when we know a point P0(x0, y0, z0)
on L and the direction of L. In three dimensions the direction of a line is described
by a vector v parallel to L. If we let r0 be the position vector of P0, then for
all real numbers t the terminal points P of the position vectors r0 + tv trace out
a line parallel to v and passing through P0.
    r = r0 + tv
for t ∈ R: r is the vector equation of a line.

The direction of a plane cannot be described by a vector in the plane.
But a vector perpendicular to a plane does completely specify the direction of the plane.
P0(x0, y0, z0) in the plane and a vector n than is orthogonal to the plane.
This orthogonal vector n is called a normal vector.
    n * (r - r0) = 0 - vector equation of the plane.

A system of equations is a set of equations that involve the same variables.
A system of linear equations is a system of equations in which each equation is linear.
A solution of a system is an assignment of values for the variables that makes each
equation in the system true.
To solve a system means to find all solutions of the system.

A system that has no solution is said to be inconsistent.
A system with infinitely many solutions is called dependent.

A linear equation in n variables is an equation that can be put in the form.
        a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + anxn = c
ak - real numbers, xk - variables.

A matrix is simply a rectangular array of numbers.
Matrices are used to organize information into categories that correspond to the
rows and columns of the matrix.

To represent a linear system by a matrix, called the augmented matrix of the system:
    { 2x  -  y = 5        [ 2  -1  | 5 ]
    {  x  + 4y = 7        [ 1   4  | 7 ]

An m x n matrix is a rectangular array of numbers with m rows and n columns.
    [ a11 a12 ... a1n ]
    [ a21 a22 ... a2n ]
    [ ............... ]
    [ am1 am2     amn ]

We say that the matrix has dimension m x n. The numbers aij are the entries of
the matrix. The subscript on the entry aij indicates that it is the i - th row
and j - th column.

Conic sections are curves that are formed when a plane cuts a cone:
    - circle
    - ellipses
    - parabolas
    - hyperbolas

Parabola: y = ax^2 + bx + c is U - shaped curve.
A parabola is the set of all points in the plane are equidistant from a fixed
point F (called the focus) and a fixed line l (called the directrix).

An ellipse is the set of all points in the plane the sum of whose distances from
two fixed points F1 and F2 is constant. These two fixed points are the foci of
the ellipse.    x^2/a^2 + y^2/(a^2 - c^2) = 1

A hyperbola is the set of all points in the plane, the difference of whose distances
from two fixed points F1 and F2 is constant: x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1

A sequence is an function a whose domain is the set of natural numbers.
The terms of sequence are the function values: a(1), a(2), ... a(k)

Given a sequence: a1, a2, ...  we can write the sum of the first n terms using
summation notation, or sigma notation. This notation derives its name from the
Greek letter ∑ (capital sigma, corresponding to our S for sum).

     n    - tells us to end with k = n
     ∑ ak - tells us to add
    k=1   - tells ta to start with k = 1

It reads as the sum of ak from k = 1 to k = n. k is the index of summation, or
the summation variable.

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of the form: a, a + d, a + 2d, ...
The number a is the first term, and d is common difference of the sequence.
The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
            an = a + (n-1)d

     n
     ∑ (a + (k - 1)d) = (n/2)(2a + (n - 1)d) = n((a + an)/2)
    k=1

A geometric sequence is generated when we start with a number a and repeatedly
multiply by a fixed nonzero constant r.
            an = a r^(n-1)
            Sn = a (1 - r^n)/(1 - r)
            n -> infinity, Sn = a/(1 - r)

Mathematical induction is a special kind of proof.
This is called the induction step.
    - P(1) is true;
    - for every natural k, if P(k) is true then P(k + 1) is true.

An expression of the form a + b is called a binomial.

    (a + b)^0                                   1
    (a + b)^1                                1     1
    (a + b)^2                             1     2     1
    (a + b)^3                          1     3     3     1
    (a + b)^4                      1      4     6     4     1

Every entry is the sum of two entries diagonally above it.

n! = 1 2 3 ... (n - 1) n  - n factorial

Let n and r be nonnegative integers with r <= n. The binomial coefficient is denoted
by   (n)
     (r) = n!/r!(n - r)!

     (  k  )    (k)   (k + 1)
     (r - 1)  + (r) = (  r  )

The binomial theorem:

    (a + b)^n = (n) a^n + (n) a^(n-1)b + ... + (  n  ) ab^(n - 1) + (n) b^n
                (0)       (1)                  (n - 1)              (n)

We write 
            lim  f(x) = L
            x->a
and say
        the limit of f(x), as x approaches a, equals L
if we can make the values of f(x) arbitrarily close to L (as close to L as we like)
by taking x to be sufficiently close to a, but not equal to a.

H(t) = { 0 if t < 0
       { 1 if t >= 0

H is Heaviside function

lim t->0 does not exist.

Definition of a one side limit, we write  lim x->a- f(x) = L
and say that the left hand limit of f(x) as x approaches a (or right hand lim x->a+ f(x)) is
equal to L if we can make the values of f(x) arbitrarily close to L by taking x
to be sufficiently close to a and x less than a.

lim x->a f(x) = L if and only if lim x->a- f(x) = L  and lim x->a+ f(x) = L

Limit laws:
    lim x->a [f(x) +/- g(x)] = lim x->a f(x) +/- lim x->a g(x)
    lim x->a [cf(x)]         = c lim x->a f(x)
    lim x->a [f(x) x// g(x)] = lim x->a f(x) x//  lim x->a g(x)
    lim x->a [f(x)^n]        = [lim x->a f(x)]^n

A tangent line is a line that just touches a curve.

 slope (m) = lim x->a (f(x) - f(a))/(x - a)

The derivative of a function f at a number a, denoted by f'(x), is

            f'(a) = lim h->0 ((f(a + h) - f(a))/h)

Let f be a function defined on some interval (a, oo). Then
            lim x->oo f(x) = L
means that the values of f(x) can be made arbitrarily close to L by taking x
sufficiently large.

The same for negative infinity x->-oo

Calculus
========

Calculus is fundamentally different from the mathematics that you have studied
previously: calculus is less static and more dynamic. It is concerned with change
and motion; it deals with quantities that approach other quantities.
Limit is the main ideas of calculus.

Calculus builds on what you have learned in algebra and analytic geometry but
advances these ideas spectacularly.

Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another.

A function f is a rule that assigns to each element x in a set D exactly one
element, called f(x), in a set E.
The set D is called the domain of the function.
The number f(x) is the value of f at x and is read "f of x".
The range of f is the set of all possible values of f(x) as x varies.

Graph is the set of ordered pairs: {(x, f(x)) | x ∈ D}

Four different ways to represent a function:
    - verbally
    - numerically (by a table)
    - visually (by a graph)
    - algebraically (by a formula)

A function f is called one to one function if it never takes on the same value twice.

Let f be a one to one function with domain A and range B.
Then its inverse f-1 has domain B and range A and is defined by
        f-1(y) = x <=> f(x) = y
