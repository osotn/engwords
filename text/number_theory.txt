Math exists mainly to give up power and control over the physical world, but it
has always been so fascinating that it was studied for its own sake. Number
theory is that sort of mathematics: it is of no use in building bridges, and
civilization would carry on much as usual if all of its theorems were to
disappear, nevertheless it has been studied and valued since the time of
Pythagoras. That greatest of mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss called it
The Queen of Mathematics.

1.  Integers
------------
The subject matter of number theory is numbers, and a large part of number
theory is devoted to studying the properties of the integers - that is, the
numbers  ... , -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...

    a divides b (a|b) if and only if there is an integer d such that ad = b.


Lemma 1. If a|d and b|a, then (a + b)|d
Proof:  From definition, dq = a and dr = b.
                         a + b = d(q + r) then (a + b)|d
