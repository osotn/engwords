MAC and PHY
PHY - converts data bits received from the MAC layer into a radio frequency (RF) waveform for transmission
and performs the reverse process.

BSS = basic service set
Ad hoc or peer-to-peer or independent BSS = IBSS
wireless distribution system = WDS
Mesh BSS (MBSS)

Infrastructure or BSS is the commonly used network architecture in which all devices
connect and communicate through a single device called the access point = AP.
The AP administers network service to all device connected to it, commonly
reffered to as clients or stations (STAs).
The AP is connected via a backhaul link to the internet and often has an integrated router capability.

MAC Frame Format
----------------
MAC header, MAC frame, FCS = frame check sequence.
MPDU = MAC protocol data unit

Frame control = 16bytes:
	protocol version = 2b
	type		   2b
        subtype
	To DS
	From DS
	More Fragment
	Retry
	Power management
	More data
	protected frame
	order
Duration
Address 1 = RA (receiver address)
Address 2 = TA (transmitter address_
Address 3 = BSS identifier, SA
ADdress 4 = BSS --------- , DA

DCF = Distributed coordination function
CSMA-CD = carrier sense multiple access collision detection.

Frame Type:
	DAta(10)	0000 Data		Carry data without QoS
			0100 Null		No data
			1000 QoS data
			1100 QoS null
	Management(00)  1000 Beacon		AP capabilty ad, STA synch, power management

			0000 Association req
			0001 Association req
			...
			1011 Authentication
	Control(01)	1101 ACK

2.1.2 MAC Frame Format and Types
--------------------------------
The MAC layer sends the data to be transmitted in a particular frame format to the PHY layer.
{MAC header, MAC frame body, FCS}.
MAC frame is MPDU - protocol data unit, MAC frame body = MSDU - MAC service data unit

Types of MAC frames:
	- data frames;
	- management frames;
	- control frame.

Management frames have a structured payload composed of some fixed length fields
and one or more variable length fields called information elements (IEs).

2.1.3 Medium Access Rules
-------------------------
The rules of WiFi medium access are described by the distributed coordination function (DCF)
protocol that is built upon the carrier sense multiple access collision detection (CSMA-CD) protocol
used in Ethernet (IEEE 802.3).
The  transceiver in WiFI is half duplex, while it is full duplex in the case of Ethernet.

2.1.4 AP discovery process
--------------------
STA must first discover APs, in its vicinity along with each AP's channel. 
STA performs this discovery by scanning all the allowed channels - 2.4GHz = 11 channels
STA listens on each channel for beacon frames (sent periodically by APs).
A network identified by its SSID. Interval = 100 TUs, 1 time unit = 1025 us: 100TU ~= 10ms!!!
STA goes to each channel, broadcasts a management frame called probe request frame with SSID.

Sometimes, one physical AP can be configured to function as multiple virtual APs.

STA completes scanning all channels, it decides which AP to connect based on several
factors such as user configuration, receive signal strenght indicator = RSSI.
Once STA determines the best API to connect to, it sends an authentication req.
The AP sends ACK for auth req and res.

Fragmentation and aggregation - PPDU = AMPDU subframe = MPDU = AMSDU subframe
PPDU = 2304 bytes, 4,484 ms


2.1.8 Fragmentation and Aggregation
-----------------------------------
MSDU can either be fragmented or aggregated.

Fragmentation - MAC header and FCS are then added to each fragmentd MSDU.
The more fragment subfield in frame control field of MAC header is set to 1
for all fragmented MSDUs except the last one and the fragment number is
indicated in the sequence control field of MAC header.

Aggregation - new generation of WiFi, the PHY data rate increases, resulting in 
reduction of the PHY payload airtime, while the duration of the PHY header
either becomes longer for backward compatibility or remains the same.

PHY header | PSDU = AMPDU
            AMPDU subframe 1 | ...
            |MPDU|
            |AMSDU|
	    |AMSDU frame 1|...
               |MSDU|

AMSDU is an aggregation of multiple MSDUs.
AMSDU subframe = containing DA, SA, MSDU
FCS files is present only at MPDU level, the receiver cannot acknowledge individual MSDUs
and the entire MPDU has to be retransmitted in the event of FCS failure.

AMPDU is an aggregation of multiple MPDUs which becomes the payload for the PHY layer known as physical layer.

MSDU = 2304 bytes
MPDU = MAC header + 3839 (AMSDU)
AMPDU = 8K to 1 M (VHT) or 64 (HT)
PPDU = 5.484 ms !!!




2.2 PHY Layer overview
----------------------
The PHY layer has a transmitter and receiver module.
The transmitter module maps the PSDU from MAC layer to RF waveform
that is transmitted using an antennas as an electromagnetic wave.

PHY layer transmitter creates a PPDU by appending the PLCP header
and PLCP preamble to the PSDU.

802.11b is 2.4GHz band = 1, 2, 5.5, 11 Mbps.
There is no error correction coe is 22 MHz.
PLCP header is 48 bits = Signal 8b, Service 8b, Length 16b, CRC 16b.
PLCP preamble = 144 us (long) or 72 us (shot).

802.11a based on OFDM technology.
20 MHz, 64 BPSK = binary phase shift keing 
PLCP preamble = 8us 

802.11g OFDM 

802.11n - 2 and 5 GHz, spatial multiplexing based on MIMO OFDM.
Error correction code = LDPC
20 us PLCP preamble

==================
The most successful wireless networking technology this far has been 802.11.

The most obvious advantage of wireless networking is mobility.

Like all networks, wireless networks transmit data over a network medium.
The medium is a form of electromagnetic radiation.
Radio waves can penetrate most office obstructions and offer a wider
coverage range.

Wireless devices are contrained to operate in a certain frequency band.
Each bandwidth, which is simpy the amount of frequency space in the band.

S-Band 2.4-2.5GHz
C-Band 4-8GHz
C-Band Radar (weather) - 5.25-5,925Ghz
X-Band 8-12GHz

ISM: Industrial, Scientific, and Medical
	Microwave oven - 2.4Ghz
ISM bands are generally license free.


Wi-Fi = Wireless Fidelity

1997:	802.11 standard 2G (included IR, two spread spectrum radio layers:
				- frequency hopping (FH);
				- direcct sequence (DS).
		- 1M, 2M
1999:   802.11a standard 5G ( + OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing))
		- up to 54M
	802.11b standard 2.4G
		- + 5.5M 11M
	802.11g standard 2.4G
		- up to 54M

MAC address 48bits - the same as for Ethernet.

802 networks have both:
	- a MACi (medium)	- how to access the medium and send data
	- a PHY (physical)	- transmission and reception.

802.3 CSMA/CD - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
802.2 LLC - Local Link Control
802.1d - Bridging
802.1q - VLAN (virtual LAN).

802.11 can use the 802.2/LLC encapsulation.

802.11 specification includes the 802.11 MAC and two physical layers:
	- frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
	- Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
802.11a + OFDM

PHY:
	- PLCP (Physical Convergence Producere) - MAC frame to medium
	- PMD (physical medium Dependet) - to transmit those frames.


4 components of 802.11:
	- DS (distribution system)
	- AP (Access point)
	- Wireless medium
	- STA (station)

When several AP are connected to form a large coverage area, they must communicate with each other to track the movements
of mobile stations. To forward frames to their destination: bridging + distribution system medium.

AP perform wireless to wired bridging function.


2.2.1 Types of Networks
-----------------------
The basic building block of an 802.11 network - BSS = basic service set (group of stations).
When a station is in the basic area, it can communicate with other members of the BSS.

IBSS = independent BSS. Stations in an IBSS communicate directly with each other and thus must
be within communication range. Referred to as ad hoc BSS or ad hoc networks.

Infrastructure BSS use of an access point.
Access points are used for all communications in infrastructure networks. If one mobile station
in an infrastructure BSS needs to communicate with a second mobile station, the communication
must be take two hops.
In an infracstructure network, stations must associate with an access point to obtain network
service. Association is the process by which mobile station joins an 802.11 network.
(it equivalent to plugging in the network cable on an Ethernet).
Mobile stations always initiate the association process, and AP may choose to grant or deny
access based on the contents of an association request.
A mobile station can be associated only one access point.

Mobility can cause one of three types of transition:
	- no transition:	stations do not move out of their current access point
	- BSS transition: 	stations continuously monitor the signal strength and quality from all APs
	- ESS transiton: 	movement from one ESS to a second distinct


Chapter 3. The 802.11 MAC
=========================
As with many other things in life, the more you know, the better off are you.

The standard successfuly adapts Ethernet style networking to radio links.
Like Ethernet, 802.11 uses a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) scheme to control access to the transmission medium.
Collisions waster valuable transmission capacity, so rather than the collision detection (CD) employed by Ethernet,
802.11 uses collision avoidance (CA). Aslo uses a distributed access scheme with no centralized controller.

3.1 Challenges for the MAC
--------------------------
3.1.1 RF Link Quality
On a wired Ethernet, it is reasonable to transmit a frame and assume that the destination receives it correctly.
802.11 incorporates positive acknowledgments. All transmitted frames must be acknowledged.

Collisions resulting from hidden nodes may be hard to detect in wireless networks because wireless
tranceivers are generally half duplex. To prevent collisions 802.11 allows stations to use Request to Send (RTS)
and Clear to Send (CTS) signals to clear out an area.
There is the RTS threshold (for frames larger than the threshold).

3.2 MAC Access Mode and Timing
------------------------------
Ethernet like CSMA/CA access is provided by the distributed coordination function (DCF).
Point coordination function (PCF), which is build on top of the DCF.
To avoid collisions, stations use a random backof after each frame, with the first transmitter seizing the channel.

3.4 Fragmentaion and reassembly
-------------------------------
3.5 Frame format
----------------
Preamble is part of the physical layer, and encapsulation details such as type and length are present in the
header on the data carried in the 802.11 frame.

Each frame start with two byte Frame Control subfield.
	- protocol version
	- type=00 Management frames
		- 0000 - association request
		- 0001 - association response
		- 0010 - reassociation request
		- 0011 - reassociation response
		- 0100 - probe request
		- 0101 - probe response
		- 1000 - beacon
		- 1001 - Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
		- 1010 - Disassociaton
		- 1011 - Authentication
		- 1100 - Deauthentication
	- type=01 Control frames
		- 1010 - Power Save (PS) Poll
		- 1011 - RTS
		- 1100 - CTS
		- 1101 - ACK
		- 1110 - Contention Free (CF) End
		- 1111 - CF-End+CF-Ack
	- type=10
		- 0000 - Data
		- 0001 - Data+CF-Ack
		- 0010 - Data+CF-Poll
		- 0011 - Data+CF-Ack+CF-Poll
		- 0100 - Null data
		- 0101 - CF-Ack
		- 0110 - CF-Poll
		- 0111 - DAta+CF-Ack+CF-Poll
 ToDS and FromDS bits
	whether a frame is destined for the distribution system.

Destination address - final recipient
Source address - 
Receiver address
Transmitter address (for bridging)

Basic Service Set Id (BSSID) - stations may be assigned to a BSS.

Sequence control: 4 bits - fragment number, 12 bits - sequence number.

Frame body - data field. Up to 2.304 bytes.
LLC headers use 8 bytes for a maximum network protocol payload of 2.296 bytes.

As with Ethernet, 802.11 frame closes with a frame check sequence (FCS).

To retrieve buffered frames, newly awakened staion use PS-Poll frames.

Once the staion receives a Beacon frame indicationg that no more traffic is buffered.

Chapter 5. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
=========================================
To protect data, WEP requires the use of the RC4 cipher, which is a symmetric (secret-key) stream cipher.
Keystream. Keystream is then combined with the message to produce the ciphertext.
To recover the original message, the receiver processes the ciphertext with an inendtical keystream.

5.2 WEP Cryptographic Operations
--------------------------------

Chapter 6. Security, Tak2 802.1x
================================
The Extensible Authentication Protocol = EAP
MD-5 Challenge is used to implement the EAP analog of the CHAP protocol.
Type code 13: TLS


Chapter 7. Management Operations
================================
MLME = Mac Layer Management Entity
PLME = physical layer management entity
SME = system management entity

7.2 Scanning
------------
Before using any network, you must first find it.
The process of idenfifying existing networks in the area is called scanning.

Scans must either transmit a Probe Request or listen on a channel for the existence of a network.

Passive scanning save battery power because it does not require transmitting.
List and waits for Beacon frames.

In active scanning a station takes a more assertive role.
On each channel, Probe Request frames are used to solicit responses from a network with a given name.
Attemps to find the network.

Scan report is generated at the conclusioin of a scan.
The report list all the BSSs that the scan discovered and their parameters.

The basic rate set is the list of data rates that must be supported by any station wishing to join the network.
Stations must be able to receive data at all the rates listed in the set.

7.5 Power conservation
----------------------
When the transceiver is off, it is said to be sleeping, dozing, or in power saving (ps) mode.
When the transceiver is on, is said to be awake, active, or simply on.

Chapter 9. Physical Layer Overview
=================================
The physical layer is divided into two sublayers:
	- Physical Layer Convergence Procesure (PLCP)
	- Physical Medium Dependent (PMD)

9.2 The Radio Link
------------------
Frequency hopping (FH) - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM
Direct sequence (DS)   - High Rate Direct Sequence (HR/DS)

FH/FHSS - Frequency hopping - systems jump from one frequency to another in a random pattern
DS/DSSS - Direct sequence systesm spread the power out over a wider frequency band using mathematical coding functions.
OFDM    - divides an available channel into several subchannels and encoded a portion of the signal across each subchannel in parallel.

LNA = low-noise amplifier.


Frame aggregation
=================
Can improve the performance of wireless networks by reducing the overhead with transmitting small packets.
In a single transmission.
Packets can be send with single PHY and MAC header.
There two kind of frame aggregation:
	- MAC Service Data Unit (MSDU): a-MSDU - with a single PHY header
	- MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU): MPDU has MAC header and trailer: a-MPDU

MSDU = max 2304 bytes

MPDU: [MAC header {MSDU}{MSDU}{MSDU}] = max 7935

(PLCP header [MAC header {MSDU}{MSDU}{MSDU}]) =>

(PLCP header [|Mac header{MSDU}|Mac header{MSDU}|Mac header{MSDU}|]) = max 65,535 bytes = PPDU


a-MSDU aggregation has less overhead than MPDU aggregation. Only one Mac header.
a-MPDU aggregation - each data packet has a MAC header (30B), MSDU subframe header 14B. Each data packet has its own FCS. Individual data packet sent in a-MPDU can be ask with a block ACK.

============
============

802.11b used CCK (complementary code keying). - 2/11M
802.11a used OFDM up to 54M.

802.11n the  big idea is MIMO. To transmit data, 802.11n can send multiple simultaneus data streams.

SISO - transmitter used one antenna, and receiver used one antenna.

Each data stream is sometimes called a spatial stream.

Space Time Block Coding (STBC) that requires two radio chains to transmit a single spatial stream.

Chapter 3. Channels, Framing and Coding
=======================================
DFS (dynamic frequency selection) band after the required procedures to detect radar and avoid interfering with
the allocated use of the band.

MCS (modulation and Coding Set) number is a value that describes the number of spatial streams, modulation (BPSK, QPSK, 16 QAM, 64 QAM),
and error correction code used for a transmission.
LDPC =  (Low Density Parity Check).

------------------------------------------------

Beamforming
----------
Prior to 802.11n most AP were equipped by default with omnidirectional antennas. = all directions.
Beamforming is 802.11 answer to this conundrum. It enables an antenna array to focus the energy in
the direction of a client device.
A transmitter, also called the beamformer, "focuses" or "steers" the energy so that the transmission tends to
go more in one direction, towards the receiver, also called a beamformee.
(The terms beamformer and beamformee are useful in the context of explicit channel measurement protocols that
require frame exchanges).

Types of beamforming:
Beamforming refers to increase SNR at the receiver.
Beamforming comes in two major flavors, and both are compared in table.
Explicit beamforming is easy to understand. Before transmitting, a device actively measures the channel,
and uses the measurement to compute the steering matrix directly.
Active channel measurement is accomplished by transmitting a sounding frame to the beamformee, which replies
with a frame that indicates how the sounding frame was received. Using this beamformer can compute the steering
matrix. The downside to explicit beamforming is that it requiers active support on both ends of the radio link.
To receive beamformed transmissions, a device must be able to send channel measuremets back to the beamformer.
Only 802.11n has defined the channel measurement sequences, which means that older a/g devices will be unable to
receive explicit beamformed frames.
Almost all 802.11n AP that support beamforming do so based on implicit beamforming.
Devices estimate the beamforming matrix from received frames. Doesn't provide quite as high a level comprehensive
measurements.

STBC (space time block code) can be used when the number of radio chains exceeds the number of spatial streams.
STBC transmits the same data stream twice across two spatial streams so that a reciever that misses a data
block from one spatial stream has a second shot at decoding the data on the second spatial stream.

LDPC (low density parity check) - error correction - increases SNR ration 1.5..3 dB.

802.11ac book
=============
=============
Chapter 4
Beamforming in 802.11ac

Traditionally, AP have been equipped with omnidirectional antennas, which are so named because they send
energy in all directions.
Focus energy toward a receiver, a process called beamforming.
At short ranges, the signal power is high enought that the SNR support the maximum data rate.
May be either explicit or implicit, depending on whether spacial channel measurement frames are used.
802.11ac requires the use of channel measument frames and is only explicit.
Any device that shapes its transmitted frames is called a beamformer, and a receiver of such frames is
called a beamformee.
In a single exchange it is possible to have only one initiator and one responder, but a station may be
both a beamformer and a beamformee.
For example, AP initiates a frame exchange to the laptop.
It begins by exchanging frames to measure the channel.
The result of the channel measurement is a derivation of the steering matrix, which is a mathematical
desciption of how to direct transmitted energy toward the receiver. After completing the channel
measurement, AP is capable of acting as a beamformer and sending spatially focused frames to the laptop.
Laptop will also act as a beamformer for the transmission of acknowledgements.
