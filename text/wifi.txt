Wi-Fi - 802.11

is a wireless LAN = WLAN technology.
AP = access point - 10..30 meters indoors.
Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA)

802.11n	- Wi-Fi 4
802.11ac  Wi-Fi 5
802.11ax  Wi-Fi 6

Wi-Fi in unlicensed spectrum.
2.4 GHz ISM band, 5 GHz U-NII band.

MAC and PHY
PHY - converts data bits received from the MAC layer into a radio frequency (RF) waveform for transmission
and performs the reverse process.

BSS = basic service set
Ad hoc or peer-to-peer or independent BSS = IBSS
wireless distribution system = WDS
Mesh BSS (MBSS)

Infrastructure or BSS is the commonly used network architecture in which all devices
connect and communicate through a single device called the access point = AP.
The AP administers network service to all device connected to it, commonly
reffered to as clients or stations (STAs).
The AP is connected via a backhaul link to the internet and often has an integrated router capability.

MAC Frame Format
----------------
MAC header, MAC frame, FCS = frame check sequence.
MPDU = MAC protocol data unit

Frame control = 16bytes:
	protocol version = 2b
	type		   2b
        subtype
	To DS
	From DS
	More Fragment
	Retry
	Power management
	More data
	protected frame
	order
Duration
Address 1 = RA (receiver address)
Address 2 = TA (transmitter address_
Address 3 = BSS identifier, SA
ADdress 4 = BSS --------- , DA

DCF = Distributed coordination function
CSMA-CD = carrier sense multiple access collision detection.

Frame Type:
	DAta(10)	0000 Data		Carry data without QoS
			0100 Null		No data
			1000 QoS data
			1100 QoS null
	Management(00)  1000 Beacon		AP capabilty ad, STA synch, power management
			0100 Probe req          Active scanning of nearby APs
			0101 Probe res		Inform STA with AP's capability
			0000 Association req
			0001 Association req
			...
			1011 Authentication
	Control(01)	1101 ACK

AP discovery process
--------------------
STA must first discover APs, in its vicinity along with each AP's channel. 
STA performs this discovery by scanning all the allowed channels - 2.4GHz = 11 channels
STA listens on each channel for beacon frames (sent periodically by APs).
A network identified by its SSID. Interval = 100 TUs, 1 time unit = 1025 us: 100TU ~= 10ms!!!
STA goes to each channel, broadcasts a management frame called probe request frame with SSID.

Sometimes, one physical AP can be configured to function as multiple virtual APs.

STA completes scanning all channels, it decides which AP to connect based on several
factors such as user configuration, receive signal strenght indicator = RSSI.
Once STA determines the best API to connect to, it sends an authentication req.
The AP sends ACK for auth req and res.

Fragmentation and aggregation - PPDU = AMPDU subframe = MPDU = AMSDU subframe
PPDU = 2304 bytes, 4,484 ms
