4.4 The awk pattern scanning and processing language
Some of the limitations of sed are remedied by awk. The idea in awk is
much the same as in sed, but the details are based more on the C programming language than on a text editor. U sage is just like sed:
$ a wk 'program' filenames ...
but the program is different:
pattern { action }
pattern { action }
awk reads the input in the filenames one line at a time. Each line is compared
with each pattern in order; for each pattern that matches the line, the
corresponding action is performed. Like sed, awk does not alter its input
files.
The patterns can be regular expressions exactly as in egrep, or they can be
more complicated conditions reminiscent of C. As a simple example, though,
$ a wk ' /regular expression/ { pr in t }' filenames ...
does what egrep does: it prints every line that matches the regular expression.
Either the pattern or the action is optional. If the action is omitted, the
default action is to print matched lines, so
$ a wk ' /regular expression/' filenames ...
does the same job as the previous example. Conversely, if the pattern is omitted, then the action part is done for every input line. So
$ awk ' { print }' filenames...
does \\i"hat cat does, albeit more slowly.
One final note before we get on to interesting examples. As with sed, it is
possible to present the program to awk from a file:
$ awk -f cmdfile filenames...
Fields
awk splits each input line automatically into fields, that is, strings of non-blank characters separated by blanks or tabs. By this definition, the ou tpu t of
who has five fields:
$ who
you
jim
$
tty2
tty4
Sep 29 11:53
Sep 29 11:27
awk calls the fields $1, $ 2, ..., $NF, where NF is a variable whose value is set
to the number of fields. In this case, NF is 5 for both lines. (Note the difference between NF, the number of fields, and $NF, the last field on the line. In
awk, unlike the shell, only fields begin with a $; variables are unadorned.)
For example, to discard the file sizes produced by du -a,
$ du -a : awk '{ print $2 }'
and to print the names of the people logged in and the time of login, one per
lin e :
$ who: awk '{ print $1, $5 }'
you 11:53
jim 11:27
$
To print the name and time of login sorted by time:
$ who: awk '{ print $5, $1 }' : sort
11:27 jim
11:53 you
$
These are alternatives to the sed versions shown earlier in this chapter.
Although awk is easier to use than sed for operations like these, it is usually
slower, both getting started and in execution when there's a lot of input.
awk normally assumes that white space (any number of blanks and tabs)
separates fields, but the separator can be changed to any single character. One
way is with the -F (upper case) command-line option. For example, the fields
in the password file /etc/passwd are separated by colons:
$ sed 3q /etc/passwd
root:3DofHR5KoB.3s:0:1:S.User:/:
ken:y.68wd1.ijayz:6:1:K.Thompson:/usr/ken:
dmr:z4u3dJWbg7wCk:7:1:D.M.Ritchie:/usr/dmr:
$
To print the user names, which come from the first field,
$ sed 3q /etc/passwd : awk -F: '{ print $1 }'
root
ken
dmr
$
The handling of blanks and tabs is intentionally special. By default, both
blanks and tabs are separators, and leading separators are discarded. If the
separator is set to anything other than blank, however, then leading separators
are counted in determining the fields. In particular, if the separator is a tab,
then blanks are not separator characters, leading blanks are part of the field,
and each tab defines a field.
Printing
awk keeps track of other interesting quantities besides the number of input
fields. The built-in variable NR is the number of the current input "record" or
line. So to add line numbers to an input stream, use this:
$ awk '{ print NR, $0 }'
The field $ 0 is the entire input line, unchanged. In a print statement items
separated by commas are printed separated by the output field separator, which
is by default a blank.
The formatting that print does is often acceptable, but if it isn't, you can
use a statement called printf for complete control of your output. For example, to print line numbers in a field four digits wide, you might use the following:
$ awk ' { printf "%4d %s\n", NR, $0 }'
%4d specifies a decimal integer (NR) in a field four digits wide, %s a string of
characters ($ 0), and \n a newline character, since printf doesn't print any
spaces or newlines automatically. The printf statement in awk is like the C
function; see printf(3).
We could have written the first version of ind (from early in this chapter)
as
awk '{ printf "\t%s\n", $0 }' $*
which prints a tab (\ t) and the input record.
Patterns
Suppose you want to look in /etc/passwd for people who have no passwords. r-fhe encrypted password is the second field, so the program is just a
pattern:
$ awk -F: ' $2 == "", /etc/passwd
The pattern asks if the second field is an empty string (' = =' is the equality test
operator). You can write this pattern in a variety of ways:
$ 2 =::: "" 2 nd field is empty
$2 - /A$/ 2nd field matches empty string
$ 2 ! - / e / 2 nd field doesn't match any character
length ($2) == 0 Length of 2nd field is zero
The symbol "" indicates a regular expression match, and ! - means "does not
match." The regular expression itself is enclosed in slashes.
length is an awk built-in function that produces the length of a string of
characters. A pattern can be preceded by ! to negate it, as in
!"(,,:t 2 = = "")
"
The' ! ' operator is like that in C, but opposite to sed, where the ! follows the
pattern.
One common use of patterns in awk is for simple data validation tasks.
1any of these amount to little more than looking for lines that fail to meet
some criterion; if there is no output, the data is acceptable ("no news is good
news"). For example, the following pattern makes sure that every input
record has an even number of fields, using the operator % to compute the
remainder:
NF % 2 != 0
# print if odd number of fields
Another prints excessively long lines, using the built-in function length:
length($O) > 72 # print if too long
awk uses the same comment convention as the shell does: a # marks the beginning of a comment.
You can make the output somewhat more informative by printing a warning
and part of the too-long line, using another built-in function, substr:
length($O) > 72 { print "Line", NR, "too long:", substr($0,1,60)
substr (s , m, n) produces the substring of s that begins at position m and is n
characters long. (The string begins at position 1.) If n is omitted, the sub-string from m to the end is used. substr can also be used for extracting
fixed-position fields, for instance, selecting the hour and minute from the output of date:
$ date
Thu Sep 29 12:17:01 EDT 1983
$ date / awk '{ print substr($4, 1, 5) }'
12:17
$
Exercise 4-7. How many awk programs can you write that copy input to output as cat
does? Which is the shortest?
The BEGIN and END patterns
awk provides two special patterns, BEGIN and END. BEGIN actions are
performed before the first input line has been read; you can use the BEGIN
pattern to initialize variables, to print headings or to set the field separator by
assigning to the variable FS:
$ awk 'BEGIN { FS = ":" }
> $2 == "" , /etc/passwd
$ No output: we all use passwords
END actions are done after the last line of input has been processed:
$ awk 'END { print NR }'
prints the nurnber of lines of input.
Arithmetic and variables
The examples so far have involved only simple text manipulation. awk's
real strength lies in its ability to do calculations on the input data as well; it is
easy to count things, compute sums and averages, and the like. A common use
of awk is to sum columns of numbers. For example, to add up all the numbers
in the first column:
{ s :: S + $1 }
END { print s }
Since the number of values is available In the variable NR, changing the last
line to
END { print s, s/NR }
prints both sum and average.
This example also illustrates the use of variables in awk. s is not a built-in
variable, but one defined by being used. Variables are initialized to zero by
default so you usually don't have to worry about initialization.
awk also provides the same shorthand arithmetic operators that C does, so
the example would normally be written
{ s += $1 }
END { print s }
S += $1 is the same as s =: S + $1, but notationaUy more compact.
You can generalize the example that counts input lines like this:
{ nc += length($O) + 1 # number of chars, 1 for \n
nw += NF # number of worp.s
}
END { print NR, nw, nc }
This counts the lines, words and characters in its input, so it does the same job
as we (although it doesn't break the totals down by file).
As another example of arithmetic, this program computes the number of
66-line pages that will be produced by running a set of files through pr. This
can be wrapped up in a command called prpages:
$ cat prpages
# prpages: compute number of pages that pr will print
wc $* :
awk 'II total$1 { n += int«$1+55) I 56) }
END { print n }'
$
pr puts 56 lines of text on each page (a fact determined empirically). The
number of pages is rounded up, then truncated to an integer with the built-in
function int, for each line of we output that does not match total at the end
of a line.
$ we eh4. oN-
753 3090
612 2421
637 2462

ch4.4
ch4.9
total
To verify this result, run pr into awk directly:
$ pr eh4.oN- : awk 'END { print NR/66 }'
53
$
Variables in awk also store strings of characters. Whether a variable is to
be treated as a number or as a string of characters depends on the context.
Roughly speaking, in an arithmetic expression like s+=$1, the numeric value
is used; in a string context like x= IV abe ", the string value is used; and in an
ambiguous case like x>y, the string value is used unless the operands are
clearly numeric. (The rules are stated precisely in the awk manual.) String
variables are initialized to the empty string. Coming sections will put strings to
good use.
awk itself maintains a number of built-in variables of both types, such as
NR and FS. Table 4.3 gives the complete list. Table 4.4 lists the operators.
Exercise 4-8. Our test of prpages suggests alternate implementations. Experiment to
see which is fastest. D
Control flow
It is remarkably easy (speaking from experience) to create adjacent duplicate words accidentally when editing a big document, and it is obvious that
that almost never happens intentionally. To prevent such problems, one of the
Table 4.3: awk Built-in Variables
name of current input file
field separator character (default blank & tab)
number of fields in input record
number of input record
output format for numbers (default %g; see printf(3))
output field separator string (default blank)
output record separator string (default newline)
input record separator character ( default newline)
awk Operators (increasing order of precedence)
= += -= *= /= %= assignment; v op= expr is v = v op (expr)
: : OR: exprl I : expr2 true if either is;
expr2 not evaluated if exprl is true
&& AND: exprl && expr2 true if both are;
expr2 not evaluated if expr 1 is false
negate value of expression
> > = < < = - - ! = - I - relational operators;
- and I - are match and non-match
nothing string concatenation
+ - plus, minus
* / % multiply, divide, remainder
+ + increment, decrement (prefix or postfix)
the components of the Writer's Workbench family of programs, called
double, looks for pairs of identical adjacent words. Here is an implementation of double in awk:
$ cat double
awk '
FILENAME != prevfile {
NR = 1
prevfile = FILENAME
# new file
# reset line number
}
NF > 0 {
if ($1 == lastword)
printf "double %s, file %s, line %d\n",$1,FILENAME,NR
for (i = 2; i <= NF; i++)
if {$i == $(i-1»
printf "double %s, file %s, line %d\n",$i,FILENAME,NR
i f (NF > 0)
lastword = $NF
}' $*
$
The operator ++ increments its operand, and the operator -- decrements.
The built-in variable FILENAME contains the name of the current input file.
Since NR counts lines from the beginning of the input, we reset it every time
the filename changes so an offending line is properly identified.
The if statement is just like that in C:
if ( condition)
statement]
else
statement2
If condition is true, then statement] is executed; if it is false, and if there is an
else part, then statement2 is executed. The else part is optional.
The for statement is a loop like the one in C, but different from the
shell's:
for ( expression]; condition; expression2)
statement
The for is identical to the following while statement, which is also valid in
awk:
expression]
whi Ie ( condition) {
statement
expression2
}
For example,
for (i = 2; i <= NF; i++)
runs the loop with i set in turn to 2, 3, ..., up to the number of fields, NF.
The break statement causes an immediate exit from the enclosing while
or for; the continue statement causes the next iteration to begin (at condition in the while and expression2 in the for). The next statement causes
the next input line to be read and pattern matching to resume at the beginning
of the awk program. The exi t statement causes an immediate transfer to the
END pattern.
Arrays
awk provides arrays, as do most programming languages. As a trivial
example, this awk program collects each line of input in a separate array element, indexed by line number, then prints them out in reverse order:
$ cat backwards
# backwards: print input in backward line order
awk' {line[NR] = $0 }
END { for (i = NR; i > 0; i--) print line[i] } , $*
$
Notice that, like variables, arrays don't have to be declared; the size of an
array is limited only by the memory available on your machine. Of course if a
very large file is being read into an array, it may eventually run out of
memory. To print the end of a large file in reverse order requires cooperation
with tail:
$ tail -5 /usr/dict/web2 : backwards
zymurgy
zymotically
zymotic
zymosthenic
zymosis
$
tai 1 takes advantage of a file system operation called seeking, to advance to
the end of a file without reading the intervening data. Look at the discussion
of lseek in Chapter 7. (Our local version of tail has an option -r that
prints the lines in reverse order, which supersedes backwards.)
Normal input processing splits each input line into fields. It is possible to
perform the same field-splitting operation on any string with the built-in function spl i t:
n = split(s, arr, sep)
.
splits the string s into fields that are stored in elements 1 through n of the
array arr. If a separator character sep is provided, it is used; ptherwise the
current value of FS is used. For example, split( $0 ,a,":") splits the input
line on colons, which is suitable for processing letc/passwd, and
spli t ( "9/29/83" , date, "I") splits a date on slashes.
$ sed 1q /etc/passwd : awk '(split($O,a,":"); print a[1]}'
root
$ echo 9/29/83 : awk '(split($O,date,"/"); print date[3]}'
83
$

Associative arrays
A standard problem in data processing is to accumulate values for a set of
name-value pairs. That is, from input like
Susie 400
John 100
Mary 200
Mary 300
John 100
Susie 100
Mary 100
we want to compute the total for each name:
John 200
Mary 600
Susie 500
awk provides a neat way to do this, the associative array. Although one normally thinks of array subscripts as integers, in awk any value can be used as a
subscript. So
{ sum[$1] += $2 }
END { for {name in sum} print name, sum [name] }
IS the complete program for adding up and printing the sums for the name-value pairs like those above, whether or not they are sorted. Each name ($1)
is used as a subscript in sum; at the end, a special form of the for statement is
used to cycle through all the elements of sum, printing them out. Syntactically, this variant of the for statement is
for (var in array)
statement
Although it might look superficially like the for loop in the shell, it's unrelated. It loops over the subscripts of array, not the elements, setting var to
each subscript in turn. The subscripts are produced in an unpredictable order,
however, so it may be necessary to sort them. In the example above, the output can be piped into sort to list the people with the largest values at the top.
$ awk '...' : sort +1nr
The implementation of associative memory uses a hashing scheme to ensure
that access to any element takes about the same time as to any other, and that
(at least for moderate array sizes) the time doesn't depend on how many elements are in the array.
The associative memory is effective for tasks like counting all the words in
the input:
$ cat wordfreq
awk' {for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) num[$i]++ }
END { for (word in num) print word, num[word] }
, $*
$ wordfreq ch4.* , sort +1 , sed 20q , 4
, -nr , ,
the 372 .cw 345 of 220 is 185
to 175 a 167 in 109 and 100
. P 1 94 .P2 94 .PP 90 $ 87
awk 87 sed 83 that 76 for 75
The 63 are 61 line 55 print 52
$
The first f or loop looks at each word in the input line, incrementing the element of array num subscripted by the word. (Don't confuse awk's $i, the i'th
field of the input line, with any shell variables.) After the files-ha1t!'been read,
the second for loop prints, in arbitrary order, the words and their counts.
Exercise 4-9. The output from wordfreq includes text formatting commands like . cw,
which is used to print words in this font. How would you get rid of such n,pn-
words? How would you use tr to make wordfreq work properly regardless of the
case of its input? Compare the implementation and performance of wordfreq to the
pipeline from Section 4.2 and to this one:
sed '5/[ ][ ]*/\
/g' $* : sort : uniq -c : sort -nr
Strings
Although both sed and awk are used for tiny jobs like selecting a single
field, only awk is used to any extent for tasks that really require programming.
One example is a program that folds long lines to 80 columns. Any line that
exceeds 80 characters is broken after the 80th; a \ is appended as a warning,
and the residue is processed. The final section of a folded line is right-justified, not left-justified, since this produces more convenient output for program listings, which is what we most often use fold for. As an example,
using 20-character lines instead of 80,
$ cat test
A short line.
A somewhat longer linee
This line is quite a bit longer than the last one.
$ fold test
A short line.
A somewhat longer li\
nee
This line is quite a\
bit longer than the\
last one.
$
Strangely enough, the 7th Edition provides no program for adding or
removing tabs, although pr in System V will do both. Our implementation of
f old uses sed to convert tabs into spaces so that awk's character count is
right. This works properly for leading tabs (again typical of program source)
but does not preserve columns for tabs in the middle of a line.
# fold: fold long lines
sed 's// /g' $* :
awk '
# convert tabs to 8 spaces
BEGIN {
N = 80 # folds at column 80
for (i = 1; i <= N; i++) # make a string of blanks
blanks ::: blanks VI "
}
{ if (en = length{$O» <= N)
print
else {
for (i ::: 1; n > N; n -::: N) {
printf "%s\\\n", substr{$O,i,N)
i += N;
}
printf "%s%s\n", substr{blanks,1,N-n), substr{$O,i)
}
} ,
In awk there IS no explicit string concatenation operator; strings are
concatenated when they are adjacent. Initially, blanks is a null string. The
loop in the BEGIN part creates a long string of blanks by concatenation: each
trip around the loop adds one more blank to the end of blanks. The second
loop processes the input line in chunks until the remaining part is short
enough. As in C, an assignment statement can be used as an expression, so
the construction
if (( n == 1 ength ( $ 0 » < :: N) ...
assigns the length of the input line to n before testing the value. Notice the
parentheses.
Exercise 4-10. Modify fold so that it will fold lines at blanks or tabs rather than splitting a word. Make it robust for long words. D
Interaction with the shell
Suppose you want to write a program field n that will print the n-th field
from each line of input, so that you could say, for example,
$ who 1 field 1
to print only the login names. awk clearly provides the field selection capability; the main problem is passing the field number n to an awk program. Here
is one implementation:
awk '{ print $'$1' }'
The $1 is exposed (it's not inside any quotes) and thus becomes the field
number seen by awk. Another approach uses double quotes:
awk "{ print \$$1 }"
In this case, the argument is interpreted by the shell, so the '$ becomes a $
and the $1 is replaced by the value of n. We prefer the single-quote style
because so many extra ,'s are needed with the double-quote style in a typical
awk program.
A second example is addup n, which adds up the numbers in the n-th field:
awk '{ s +== $'$1' }
END { print s }'
A third example forms separate sums of each of n columns, plus a grand
total:
awk '
BEGIN { n = '$1' }
{ for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
sum[i] += $i
}
END {
for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
printf "%6g ", sum[i]
total += sum[i]
}
printf "; total = %6g\n", total
} ,
We use a BEGIN to insert the value of n into a variable, rather than cluttering
up the rest of the pr0gram with quotes.
The main problem with all these examples is not keeping track of whether
one is inside Qr outside of the quotes (though that is a bother), but that as
currently written, such programs can read only their standard input; there is no
way to pass them both the parameter n and an arbitrarily long list of
filenames. This requires some shell programming that we'll address in the next
chapter.
A calendar service based on awk
Our final example uses associative arrays; it is also an illustration of how to
interact with the shell, and demonstrates a bit about program evolution.
The task is to have the system send you mail every morning that contains a
reminder of upcoming events. (There may already be such a calendar service;
see calendar( 1). This section shows an alternate approach.) The basic service should tell you of events happening today; the second step is to give a day
of warning - events of tomorrow as well as today. The proper handling of
weekends and holidays is left as an exercise.
The first requirement is a place to keep the calendar. For that, a file called
calendar in /usr/you seems easiest.
$ cat calendar
Sep 30 mother's birthday
Oct 1 lunch with joe, noon
Oct 1 meeting 4pm
$
Second, you need a way to scan the calendar for a date. There are many
choices here; we will use awk because it is best at doing the arithmetic necessary to get from "today" to "tomorrow," but other programs like sed or
egrep can also serve. The lines selected from the calendar are shipped off by
mail, of course.
Third, you need a way to have calendar scanned reliably and automatically every day, probably early in the morning. This can be done with at,
which we mentioned briefly in Chapter 1.
If we restrict the format of calendar so each line begins with a month
name and a day as produced by date, the first draft of the calendar program
IS easy:
$ date
Thu Sep 29 15:23:12 EDT 1983
$ cat bin/calendar
# calendar: version 1 -- today only
awk <$HOME/calendar '
BEGIN { split("''''date'''''', date) }
$1 == date[2] && $2 == date[3]
, : mail $NAME
$
The BEGIN block splits the date produced by date into an array; the second
and third elements of the array are the month and the day. Weare assuming
that the shell variable NAME contains your login name.
The remarkable sequence of quote characters is required to capture the date
in a string in the middle of the awk program. An alternative that is easier to
understand is to pass the date in as the first line of input:
$ cat bin/calendar
# calendar: version 2 -- today only, no quotes
(date; cat $HOME/calendar) :
awk '
NR == 1 { mon = $2; day = $3 } # set the date
NR > 1 && $1 == mon && $2 == day # print calendar lines
, : mail $NAME
$
The next step is to arrange for calendar to look for tomorrow as well as
today. Most of the time all that is needed is to take today's date and add 1 to
the day. But at the end of the month, we have to get the next month and set
the day back to 1. And of course each month has a different number of days.
This is where the associative array comes in handy. Two arrays, days and
nextmon, whose subscripts are month names, hold the number of days in the
month and the name of the next month. Then days[ "Jan"] is 31, and
nextmon [ "Jan"] is Feb. Rather than create a whole sequence of statements
like
days["Jan"] = 31; nextmon["Jan"] = "Feb"
days["Feb"] = 28; nextmon["Feb"] = "Mar"
we will use split to convert a convenient data structure into the one really
needed:
$ cat calendar
# calendar: version 3 -- today and tomorrow
awk <$HOME/calendar '
BEGIN {
x = "Jan 31 Feb 28 Mar 31 Apr 30 May 31 Jun 30 " ,
"Jul 31 Aug 31 Sep 30 Oct 31 Nov 30 Dec 31 Jan 31"
split(x, data)
for (i = 1; i < 24; i += 2) {
days[data[i]] = data[i+1]
nextmon[data[i]] = data[i+2]
}
split("'"'date'"'", date)
mon1 = date[2]; day1 = date[3]
mon2 = mon1; day2 = day1 + 1
if (day1 >= days[mon1]) {
day2 = 1
mon2 = nextmon[mon1]
}
}
$1 -- mon1 && $2 -- day1 I I $1 -- mon2 && $2 -- day2
, I mail $NAME
$
Notice that Jan appears twice in the data; a "sentinel" data value like this simplifies processing for December.
The final stage is to arrange for the calendar program to be run every day.
What you want is for someone to wake up every morning at around 5 AM and
run calendar. You can do this yourself by remembering to say (every day!)
$ at Sam
calendar
ctl-d
$
but that's not exactly automatic or reliable. The trick is to tell at not only to
run the calendar, but also to schedule the next run as well.
$ cat early.morning
calendar
echo early.morning I at Sam
$
The second line schedules another at command for the next day, so once
started, this sequence is self-perpetuating. The at command sets your PATH,
current directory and other parameters for the commands it processes, so you
needn't do anything special.
Exercise 4-11. Modify calendar so it knows about weekends: on Friday, "tomorrow"
includes Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Modify calendar to handle leap years.
Should calendar know about holidays? How would you arrange it?
Exercise 4-12. Should calendar know about dates inside a line, not just at the beginning? How about dates expressed in other formats, like 10/1/83? 0
Exercise 4-13. Why doesn't calendar use getname instead of $NAME? 0
Exercise 4-14. Write a personal version of rm that moves files to a telnporary directory
rather than deleting them, with an at command to clean out the directory while you are
sleeping. 0
Loose ends
awk is an ungainly language, and it's impossible to show all its capabilities
in a chapter of reasonable size. Here are some other things to look at in the
manual:
. Redirecting the output of print into files and pipes: any print or
printf statement can be followed by > and a filename (as a quoted string
or in a variable); the output will be sent to that file. As with the shell, »
appends instead of overwriting. Printing into a pipe uses I instead of >.
. Multi-line records: if the record separator RS is set to newline, then input
records will be separated by an empty line. In this way, several input lines
can be treated as a single record.
. "Pattern, pattern" as a selector: as in ed and sed, a range of lines can be
specified by a pair of patterns. This matches lines from an occurrence of
the first pattern until the next occurrence of the second. A simple example
IS
NR == 10, NR == 20
which matches lines 10 through 20 inclusive.
