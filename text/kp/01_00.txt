CHAPTER 1: UNIX FOR BEGINNERS
What is "UNIX"? In the narrowest sense, it is a time-sharing operating system kernel: a program that controls the resources of a computer and allocates
them among its users. It lets users run their programs; it controls the peripheral devices (discs, terminals, printers, and the like) connected to the
machine; and it provides a file system that manages the long-term storage of
information such as programs, data, and documents.
In a broader sense, "UNIX" is often taken to include not only the kernel,
but also essential programs like compilers, editors, command languages, programs for copying and printing files, and so on.
Still more broadly, "UNIX'" may even include programs developed by you or
other users to be run on your system, such as tools for document preparation,
routines for statistical analysis, and graphics packages.
Which of these uses of the name "UNIX" is correct depends on which level
of the system you are considering. When we use "UNIX" in the rest of this
book, context should indicate which meaning is implied.
The UNIX system sometimes looks more difficult than it is - it's hard for a
newcomer to know how to make the best use of the facilities available. But
fortunately it's not hard to get started - knowledge of only a few programs
should get you off the ground. This chapter is meant to help you to start using
the system as quickly as possible. It's an overview, not a manual; we'll cover
most of the material again in more detail in later chapters. We'll talk about
these major areas:
. basics - logging in and out, simple commands, correcting typing mistakes,
mail, inter-terminal communication.
. day-to-day use - files and the file sytem, printing files, directories,
commonly-used commands.
. the command interpreter or shell - filename shorthands, redirecting input
and ou tpu t, pipes, setting erase and kill characters, and defining your own
search path for commands.
If you've used a UNIX system before, most of this chapter should be familiar;
you might want to skip straight to Chapter 2
You will need a copy of the UNIX Programmer's Manual, even as you read
this chapter; it's often easier for us to tell you to read about something in the
manual than to repeat its contents here. This book is not supposed to replace
it, but to show you how to make best use of the commands described in it.
Furthermore, there may be differences between what we say here and what is
true on your system. The manual has a permuted index at the beginning that's
indispensable for finding the right programs to apply to a problem; learn to use
it.
Finally, a word of advice: don't be afraid to experiment. If you are a
beginner, there are very few accidental things you can do to hurt yourself or
other users. So learn how things work by trying them. This is a long chapter,
and the best way to read it is a few pages at a time, trying things out as you
go..
