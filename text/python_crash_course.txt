2. Variables and simple Data types
----------------------------------
How to use variables to represent data in your programs.

Every variable is connected to a value, which is the information associated
with that variable.
Adding variable, when it processes the first line, it associate the
variable with the type of value.

Variable name should be short but descriptive.

Variables are often described as boxes you can store values in.
But it isn't an accurate way to describe how variables are represented
internally in Python.
It's much better to think of variables as   labels   that you can assign to
values. Or variable references.

Data:
    - strings

Strings is a series of characters. "" ''

str.uppper().lower().title()
s = f"{s1} {s2}" # f-string = format string

whitespace refers to any nonprinting characters.
"\t\n"

Stripping whitespaces
s.rstrip() - rigth side stripping
s.lstrip()
s.strip()
s.removeprefix('pref')

3. List
-------
A list is a collection of items in a particular order.
l = [1, 2, 3]
Access by index l[0] l[-1]
Modifying l[0] = 4
Appending l.append(5)
Inserting l.insert(index, elem)
Removing  del l[0] - del statement, l.pop() - removing the last = del l[-1] or l.pop(index) or l.remove(elem) by elem
Sorting: l.sort(), l.sort(reverse=True), l2 = sorted(l), l.reverse()
Len: len(l)

4. Working with List
--------------------
for elem in l:
    print(elem)

range() - function make it easy to generate a series of numbers.
range(1,5)
list(range(1,5))

statistics: min(l) max(l) sum(l)

squares = [value**2 for value in range(1,11)]
