Cambium Networks
----------------
Fixed wireless is the operation of wireless communication devices or systems
used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building)
with a radio or other wireless link, such as laser bridge. It is part of a wireless
LAN infrastructure.
The point-to-point signal transmissions occur through the air over a terrestrial
microwave platform rather than through copper or optical fiber.
Fixed wireless antennas are generally larger than those in Wi-Fi setups and are
designed for outdoor use. These antennas are typically designed to be used
in the unlicensed ISM band radio frequency bands (900 MHz, 1.8 GHz, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz).

Cambium Networks (formerly known as Motorola Canopy) is a fixed wireless networking
system designed for wireless Internet service providers to provide Internet access.
An American software company, it provides wireless technology, including 
 - Enterprise WiFi
 - switching solutions;
 - Internet of Things;
 - fixed wireless broadband for enterprises.

It spun out of Motorola in October 2011.

Point-to-point backhaul.
In a hierarchical telecommunications network, the backhaul portion of the network comprises the intermediate links between the core network, or backbone network, and the small subnetworks at the edge of the network.

 - point-to-point backhaul;
 - point-to-multipoint communication wide area network (WAN);
 - Wi-Fi indoor;
 - outdoor access;
 - cloud-based network management systems.

Cambium Networks was created when Motorola Solutions sold the Canopy and Orthogon
businesses in 2011.
Three product lines:
 - Point-to-point (PTP) (formerly Orthogon);
 - Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) (formerly Canopy);
 - ePMP = economic / equalize PMP !!!

ePMP is a revolutionary wireless access platform for connecting emerging communities
around the globe. e = equalize --- connect the unconnected. Make a difference, equalize
is our call to action.

Proprietary wireless IEEE 802.11 compatible protocol implementation, based on TDD, allowing long distance P2P and PMP links with high throughput.
