Quality of Service (QoS) is implemented in the device.

Traffic types:
    incoming traffic into:
        - data;
        - control;
        - mirror to analyzer.

Data:
    - from a network port => <command> FORWARD / MIRROR TO CPU;
    - from a cascade port => DSA tag <command> FORWARD

Control:
    - TRAP by ingress pipe;
    - MIRROR
    - TO_CPU
    - FROM_CPU


24.1.3 Packet QoS Attributes:
    Every packet classified as Data is assigned a set of QoS attributes.
        - QoS precedence;
        - QoS profile = 0-1023
        - Modify DSCP/EXP
        - Modify UP0 - user priority

24.1.4 QoS Profile
    Device supports 1K QoS profiles.
    Every packet classified as Data is assigned the QoS profile,
    index 0 - 1023.

24.2.1 Default ePort-based QoS Marking

Each physical port has an configurable "Default ePort" which, by default,
is initialized to the physical port number.

Packet is trusted, or not trusted.


24.3 Ingress Policing

Ingress policing supports physical-port-based, ePort-based, eVLAN based, or,
flow based metering of traffic classified as Data by binding a specific flow
with a rate limiter.

The traffic Policer uses one or two rate three color rate limiters to classify
as in profile (GREEN) of out of profile (YELLOW or RED).
