Logic
For dummies
===========

Logic is natural - at least to humans.

Logic is one of the few areas of study taught in two different college
departments: maths and philosophy.

Logic was founded by Aristotle and developed by philosophers for centuries.
But, about 150 years ago, mathematicians found that logic was an indispensable
tool for grounding their work as it becase more and more abstract.

-----------------------------
I.  Overview of Logic

-----------------------------------------------
1.  What is this thing called logic?

We live in an illogical world.

One way to understand the world is to notice the connection between cause and
effect.

The premises are the facts of the matter: The statements that you know
(or strongly believe) to be true.

Logical arguments about real world situations (in constrast to mathematical or
scientific arguments) almost always have enthymemes (hidden in an argument).

Uncovering hidden premises in real world arguments is more related to rhetoric,
which is the study of how to make cogent and convincing arguments.

Logic laws:
    - the law of identity
            Every individual thing is identical to inself.
    - the law of the excluded middle
            Every statement is either true or false.
    - the law of non contradiction
            Given a statemenent and its opposite one is true and the other is false.

Math and logic go great together.

Math is built on logic as a house is built on a foundation.

2.  Logical developments from Aristotle to the Computer

The ancient Greeks had a hand in discovering just about everything, and logic
is no exception.
Thales and Pythagoras applied logical argument to mathematics.
Socrates and Plato applied similar types of reasoning to philosophical questions.
Founder of classical logic was Aristotle.

Aristotle assembled in single work called Organon (means Tool). He analyzed how
a logical argument functions.

Science consisted of proofs,
proofs of syllogisms,
syllogisms of statements,
statements of terms.

In a syllogism, the premises and conclusions fit together in such a way that,
once you accept the premises as true, you must accept that the conclusion is
true as well - regardless of the content of the actual argument being made.

Categorical statements are simply statements that talk about whole categories of
objects or people.

Categorical statements:
    - universal statements;
        Tell something about an entire category.
    - particular statements;
        Tell about the existence of at least one example within a category.

The square of oppositions - a tool Aristotle developed for studying categorical
statements - organizes the four basic forms of categorical statements that
appear frequently in syllogisms.

                           Positive forms                 Negative forms


    Universal  forms:      A: All cat are sleeping.       E: No cats are sleeping.
                              No cats are not sleeping.      All cats are not 
                              Every cat is sleeping.         There isn't
    
    Particular forms:      I: Some cats are sleeping.     O: Not all cats are sleeping
                              Not all cats are not           Some cats are not
                              At least one cat is            There is
                              There exists

Contradictory pairs in diagonal: Neither A/E or O/I.

Eclid began with five axioms (called postulates) - true statements that he
believed were simple and self evident. From these axioms, he used logic to prove
theorems.

Liberal arts in universities in 12th century:
    logic, grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.

George Boole (1815-1864)    -   Boolean algebra.
Set theory by Georg Cantor in the 1870s.
A set is just a collection of things.

Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) invented formal logic.
    E & P  => E -> ~P

Quantifiers: All, exist.


------------------------------------------
3.  Just for the sake of argument

Logic is the study of argument validity; which is whether a logical argument is
valid (good) on invalid (bad).
An argument, in logic, is a set of one or more premises followed by a conclusion,
which are often connected by one or more intermediate statements.
The premises and the conclusion are always statements - sentences that give
information and that are either true or false.
In a valid argument, if all of the premises are true, the conclusion must also
be true.

Logic is the study of how to decide the circumstances in which a set of true
premises leads to a conclusion that is also true.

The premises and the conclusion of an argument all have one thing in common:
They are statements. A statement is simply a sentece that gives information.

In a good argument - or a valid argument, as logicians say - when all the
premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.

Logic may have both and a bad reputation because people think it's something
that it isn't.

In sound argument, the premises are true beyond all doubt. In a cogent argument,
the promises are true beyond a reasonable doubt.

The philosopher Karl Popper took on the apparent contradiction, showing that
induction isn't necessary for scientific discovery.

The study of what makes an argument cogent or convincing is useful and
provocative, but it's also outside the scope of this book. From a purely logical
standpoint, once an argument is valid, no further improvement is possible.

Logic is one of the three theoretical legs that math stand on. (The other two
are set theory and number theory).
Logic and math work so well together because they're both independent from
reality and because they're tools that are used to help people make sense of the
world.

Science uses logic to a great advantage. Like math, science uses abstractions
to make sense of reality and then applies logic to these abstractions.

The sciences attempt to understand reality by:
    1.   reducing reality to set of abstractions, called a model;
    2.   working within this model to reach a conclusion;
    3.   applying this conclusion back to reality again.

Logic is insturment during the second step.

The areas of science that rely most heavily on logic and math are quantifiable
sciences, such as physics, engineering, and chemistry.
The qualitative sciences - biology, physiology, and medicine - use logic but with
a bit less certainty. Finally, the social sciences - such as psychology, sociology,
and economics - are the sciences whose models bear the least direct correlation
to reality, which means they tend to rely less on pure logic.

A huge part of the success of the computer revolution rests firmly on logic.

Laws exist primarily as sets of definitions: contracts, torts, felonies, intent
to cause bodily harm, and so on. These concepts all come into being on paper and
then applied to specific cases and interpreted in the courts. A legal definition
provides the basis for a legal argument, which is similar to a logical argument.

================================
II. Formal Sentential Logic (SL)

------------------------------
4.  Formal affairs

Sentential logic also known as propositional logic. It is one of two forms of
classical formal logic (the other form is quantifier logic, or QL, also known as
predicate logic).

Sentential logic is a language specifically designed to express logical arguments
with precision and clarity. Because SL is a symbolic language, it has the added
advantage of allowing for calculation according to precisely defined rules and
formulas.

Formal logic, which was developed by mathematicians, use letters as stand ins.
Logic uses statements rather than numbers, so it's logical to guess that
in formal logic, letters stand for statements.
For example:
    Let K = Katy is feeding her fish
    Let F = The fish are joyfully flapping their little fins.
This letter called a statement constant.
(By convention, capital letters are used for constants).
Logicians tend to like the letters P and Q the most.
P  is the first letter in the proposition (statement)
Q  just came along for ride.

Logicians use a letter for any statement, even a statement in SL.
When letters are used in this way, they're called statement variables.
This letter called a statement variable.
(Small letters are used for variables: x, y, w, z).

True is shortened to T and false to F.

Boolean algebra, the precursor to formal logic, uses the value 1 to represent T
and 0 to represent F.

SL has five basic operators. Its are similar to the arithmetic operators.
Logical operators really only deal with two values: the truth values, T and F.

    ~   Negation        Not                ~x           tilde
    &   Conjuction      And                x & y
    V   Disjunction     Or                 x V y
    ->  Conditional     If ... then        x -> y
   <->  Biconditional   If and only if     x <-> y

    ~~x == x

In English, the word or has two distinct meaning:
    - inclusive or: "this choice or that choice, or both"
    - exclusive or: "this choice or that choice, but not both"

    V-operator is always inclusive.

Conditional operator.
    if W then D
    W -> D
    
    x   y   x -> y
    -   -   ------
    T   T      T
    T   F      F
    F   T      T
    F   F      T

Converse statement of x -> y is y -> x
Inverse statement if negate both part:  ~x -> ~y

 x -> is not necessarily that y -> x or/and ~x -> ~y

If and only if operator <->  biconditional operator.

    x   y   x <-> y
    -   -   -------
    T   T      T
    T   F      F
    F   T      F
    F   F      T

Neither ... nor      ~M and ~N
Not     ... both     ~(M & N)
Or      ... or both   K V O
Or      ... but not both   (K V O) & ~(K & O)

----------------------------
5.  The value of evaluation

A sub statement is any piece of a statement that can stand on its own as a
complete statement.

The scope of an operation is the smallest sub statement that includes the
operator in question.

The scope of ~ operator is always the smallest sub statement that immediately
follows it.

----------------------------------
6.  Turning the tables

Tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the truth values of
its constants.
Contradiction is a statement that is always false, regardless of the truth
value of its constants.
Contingent statement is a statement that is true under at least one interpretation
and false under at least one interpretantion.

P -> Q and ~P V Q are semantically equivalent.

--------------------------------------------------
7.  Taking the easy way out: Creating quick tables

Quick tables use only one row to do the work of an entire truth table.

--------------------------------------------------
8.  Truth grows on trees
