Understanding Carrier Signals
Because data ultimately consists of bits, the transmitter needs a way of sending both 0s
and 1s to transmit data from one location to another. An AC or DC signal by itself does
not perform this task. However, if a signal fl uctuates or is altered, even slightly, the signal
can be interpreted so that data can be properly sent and received. This modifi ed signal is
now capable of distinguishing between 0s and 1s and is referred to as a carrier signal. The
method of adjusting the signal to create the carrier signal is called modulation.
Three components of a wave that can fl uctuate or be modifi ed to create a carrier signal
are amplitude, frequency, and phase.
This chapter reviews the basics of waves as they relate to the principles of
data transmission. Chapter 2, “Radio Frequency Fundamentals,” covers
radio waves in much greater detail.
All radio-based communications use some form of modulation to transmit data. To
encode the data in a signal sent by AM/FM radios, mobile telephones, and satellite television, some type of modulation is performed on the radio signal that is being transmitted.
The average person typically is not concerned with how the signal is modulated, only that
the device functions as expected. However, to become a better wireless network administrator, it is useful to have a better understanding of what is actually happening when two
stations communicate. The rest of this chapter provides an introduction to waves as a basis
for understanding carrier signals and data encoding and introduces you to the fundamentals of encoding data.
