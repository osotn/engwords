Verbs
=====
Verbs are words that represent actions that:
    - external (run, jump, work0
    - internal (love, think, consider).

Some verbs act as "helper verbs" to change the tense of another verb.

Verbs types:
============
    - dynamic (action) - walk, laugh, swim, play, eat, ...
    - stative (state-of-being) - want, need, prefer, love
    - can be dynamic or stative - see, hear, taste, smell, feel

    - auxiliary (helping) - be, have, do
    - modal auxiliary - show necessity, possibility, or capability -
        could, should, would, must, ought, might
    - phrasal - combining two or more words and changing their meaning.

Verb categories: how acts with direct and indirect objects.
===============
    I threw the ball to the sky
               ------       ------
               direct obj   indirect obj

    - intransitive - don't use a direct or indirect object, complete actioins by themselves
        go, walk, run, talk, sit, sleep work

    - transitive - use direct object, but not an indirect object
        clean, like, love, dislike, hate, want, learn, ..

        throw, make, buy, sell, read, give, lend, bring
 
    - ambitransitive - sometimes act as transitive.

Verbs voice:
===========
    - active
    - passive

Linking (copular) verbs
=======================
    directly connects or links the sentence's subject to other words in the sentance
        Garfield is a cat -  is + a cat

Verbs:
======
    - regular
    - irregular

Verbs conjugate:
================

root          3rd person sing   Simple past   Present participle  Past participle
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dance (reg)   dances            danced        dancing             danced
sing (irreg)  sings             sang          singing             sung


Infinitives and gerunds
-----------------------
An infinitive adds the preposition "to" in front of a verb's root form.
An infinitive acts as a single word, usually a noun.
Alternatively, you can turn the verb into gerund by adding -ing = present participle.

Direct objects in English
=========================
Direct object is a word or phrase that receives the action of the verb.

    The students eat cake
                     ----- direct obj,  what did the student eat?
    The family hugged their dog.
                            --- direct obj, whom did the family hug?

Direct object is a noun that receives the action of the verb.
Answer the questions "what?/whom?"

Verbs that take a direct object are called transitive verbs, and those that do not
are called intransitive verbs (sometimes intransitive verbs are followed by
a prepositional phrase or adverbial phrase.

    Laugh - intransitive verb
    Laugh at - phrase verb + transitive

    Enjoy - transitive verb
    Drive - intransitive/transitive verb
      - We drove to the mall
      - My sister drove us to the mall
                        --- direct obj.

Direct objects:
    - one words
    - phrases
    - clauses

Direct object pronouns: me, you him/her/it, us, them

Direct obj vs. indirect objects
-------------------------------
    - direct obj       "What? Whom?"
    - indirect obj     "To whom? For what?"
    
    My brother loaned me five dollars.
                      --- indirect obj

Indirect obj is also only with transitive verbs.
(optional for transitive verbs).
Indirect obj can only be used in sentances with direct obj, or without indirect obj.

Ditransitive verbs (don't need indirect obj):
    ask, bring, buy, get, give, hand, introduce, loan, owe, promise, read, ...


Indirect objects can only be placed directrly after the verb and before the direct object!!!!


    Ben passed Anna the ball
               ---- indirect obj
    Ben passed the ball to Anna.
                           ---- object of an independent preposition

    I loaned him                                  some money
             --- indirect obj
    I loaned my tall, bald friend of ten years    some money
             ---------------------------------- indirect obj (phrase).

Clauses
=======
A clauses is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb that have a
relationship.
    Phrase:     Meows so loudly
    Clause:     that cat meows so loudly

    Sentence    <clause> when she wants to eat.

Clauses can perform three distinct functions:
    - operate as adverbs;
    - operate as adjectives;
    - operate as nouns.

Noun   clause:    She completely understood  <everything he said> = his explanation
Adverb clause:    She fixed the sink <without facing difficulty>  = easily

Clauses:
    - independent       - can stand on its own as a distinct sentence = simple sentence.
    - dependent         - can't be a complete sentence.
    (Whenever the dependent clause comes first in a complex sentence, it's followed by a comma).

Compound sentence = n*(independent clause)
In compound sentences, the clauses are joined by:
    - a comma;      I love drinking soda, (but) I know it's bad for my teeth
    - semicolon;    Maria loved hosting dinner parties; her friends enjoyed her cooking.
    - colon.        We danced until the band finished playing: they played until midnight.

Coordinating  conjunction:   for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so
Subordinating conjunction:   after, as, as if, as long, because, before, if, so, 

Independent clauses combine using a coordinating conjunction.
If you need to combine a dependent clause with an independent clause, you need
a subordinating conjunction.

Complex sentence    - include an independent and one or more dependent clauses.

Syntax
======
Syntax in linguistics refers to the arrangement of words and phrases.
Syntax covers topics like word order and grammar rules.

Changing the placement of a word often changes the meaning of the sentence.
Rules:
    1.  All sentences require a subject and a verb.
        (Imperative sentences (commands) do not need to include their subject).
    2.  A single sentence should include one main idea.
    3.  The subject comes first, and the verb comes the second. If the sentence
        has objects, they come third, after the verb.
    4.  Subordinate clauses (dependent) also require a subject and verb.
    5.  Adjectives and adverbs go in front of the words they describe.

Patterns
--------
    1.  Subject -> verb
        The dog    barked.
    2.  Subject -> verb -> direct object
        The dog    carried the ball.
    3.  Subject -> verb -> subject complement
        The dog    is      playful
    4.  Subject -> verb -> adverbial complement
        The dog    ate     hungrily
    5.  Subject -> verb -> indirect object -> direct object
        The dog    gave    me                 the ball
    6.  Subject -> verb -> direct object -> object complement
        The dog    made    the ball         dirty.
    7.  Subject -> verb -> direct object -> adverbial complement
        The dog    perked  its ears         up
