hello nurse carom I'm dr. Vijay sagar

professor and head department of anatomy

at the sri ramachandra Medical College

and Research Institute in Chennai in

this lesson we will be talking about the

brachial plexus what is a nerve plexus

we will start from the beginning the

spinal cord runs within the vertebral

canal the spinal cord gives out 31 pairs

of spinal nerves

each spinal nerve is made of a ventral

root and a dorsal root the ventral root

and the dorsal root unite to form a

spinal nerve each spinal nerve is a

mixed nerve which divides into a ventral

and dorsal primary ramus now if you see

in this particular picture the spinal

cord gives eight cervical spinal nerves

it gives 12 thoracic spinal nerves it

gives five lumbar spinal nerves five

sacral spinal nerves and one coccygeal

spinal nerve in all there are a total of

31 pairs of spinal nerves

now these ventral rami of many of these

spinal nerves come together to form a

network of nerves the network of nerves

gives branches to various body areas and

the branches from the plexus can be

purely sensory or have both motor and

sensory innervation for instance

cervical nerves 1 2 3 & 4 form a network

of nerves which is called as the

cervical plexus cervical spinal nerves 5

6 7 8

and the first thoracic spinal nerve

together form a network of nerves which

form what is called as the brachial

plexus which is the topic of in this

particular listen lumbar spinal nerves L

1 2 3 & 4 along with the twelfth

thoracic nerve form the lumbar plexus

and similarly sacral nerves 1 2 3 & 4

form the sacral plexus

so the topic of today's discussion is

the brachial plexus which is formed by a

network of nerves from cervical spinal

nerves five six seven eight and t1

that is the first thoracic spinal nerve

now the brachial plexus can get injured

as a result of trauma fractures or birth

injuries there could be the involvement

of the entire plexus in which the entire

plexus gets damaged or there could be

damage to components of the plexus that

is damage to the trunks either the upper

trunk or the lower trunk of the plexus

or there can be damage to specific

portions of the plexus called as damage

to the cords of the plexus in this

particular lesson we will be discussing

the injury to the long torus igner

injury to the suprascapular nerve

injuries to the axillary nerve a common

entity which is called as the herb

Duchenne paralysis

clunk is paralysis acute brachial plexus

neuritis compression of cords of the

brachial plexus which is called as the

hyper abduction syndrome and finally a

few words about the brachial plexus an

aesthetic block so let's start this

lesson with the formation of the

brachial plexus the brachial plexus is

formed by the ventral rami of spinal

nerves see five six seven eight

and the first thoracic spinal nerve the

brachial plexus lies in the neck and in

the axilla and has two parts a part

which is above the clavicle which is

called as the supraclavicular part and a

part which is below the clavicle which

is called as the infra clavicle apart

the brachial plexus has four components

the roots are the spinal nerves which

form the brachial plexus namely c5 c6 c7

c8 and t1 the roots of the brachial

plexus emerge out between the scalene

muscles in the posterior triangle the

roots unite in a specific sequence to

form the trunks and the trunks cross the

lower part of the

posterior triangle of the neck in this

picture you see the roots which are in

the posterior triangle the roots unite

to form the trunks which are located in

the lower part of the posterior triangle

of the neck the trunks divided into

divisions which lie behind the clavicle

and various divisions unite in a

specific sequence to form chords which

are arranged around the axillary artery

and the chords of the brachial plexus

give rise to the main nerves of the

upper limb now let us see how the roots

unite to form the trunks in this picture

you see the ventral drama of spinal

nerves c5 c6 c7 c8 and t1 the ventral

rami of c5 and six unite to form a trunk

which is called as the upper trunk the

ventral ramus of c7 alone forms a trunk

which is called as the middle trunk the

ventral rami of c8 and t1 unite to form

a trunk which is called as the lower

trunk so in this picture you see there

is an upper trunk which is formed by the

union of c5 and c6 roots a middle trunk

which is formed from the c7 root and a

lower trunk which is formed from the c8

and the t1 roots now each of these

trunks divides into two divisions each

of these trunks divides into an anterior

division and a posterior division an

anterior division here and a posterior

division an anterior division here and a

posterior division the anterior

divisions of the upper trunk and the

middle trunk you can say this this is

the anterior division of the upper trunk

this is the anterior division of the

middle trunk the two of these unite to

form a cord which is called as the

lateral cord the anterior division of

the lower trunk forms the medial cord

the posterior divisions of all the three

trunks that is the posterior division of

the upper trunk the posterior division

of the middle trunk and the posterior

division of the lower trunk unite to

form a large trunk or a cord which is

called as the posterior cord so you have

the lateral cord

from the upper and the middle trunks a

medial cord from the lower trunk and the

posterior divisions of all the upper

middle and the lower trunk unite to form

the posterior cord now in this picture

you will see a schematic formation of

the brachial plexus the c5 and the c6

are uniting to form the upper trunk the

c7 forms the middle trunk the c8 and t1

forms the lower trunk the anterior

divisions of the upper and the middle

trunks form the lateral cord the

anterior divisions of the lower trunk

forms the medial cord and the posterior

divisions of all the three trunks unite

to form the posterior cord now we come

to the branches of the components the

roots of the brachial plexus give rise

to four nerves whereas the trunks of the

brachial plexus give rise to two nerves

there are no nerves which emerge out

from the divisions while the cords the

lateral cord gives rise to three

important nerves the medial and

posterior cords both give rise to five

nerves each now we'll have a look at the

branches from the roots of the brachial

plexus the first nerve which emerges

from the roots of the brachial plexus is

the dorsal scapular nerve with the root

value of c5 the dorsal scapular nerve

innervates the muscles of the back of

the shoulder namely the rhomboids and

the levator scapulae the next nerve

which originates from the roots is the

long taurus igner which is also called

as the nerve of belle this nerve

innervates serratus anterior and has a

root value of C five six and seven if

you look at this particular picture this

nerve which is formed by the

contributions of c5 c6 and c7 cervical

spinal nerves forms this long torus

ignor which innervates serratus anterior

in addition there are unnamed muscular

branches which innervate the scalene I

and the longest coleye muscles of the

neck they also have a root value of c5

c6 and c7

the lower route of the phrenic nerve is

contribution from the fifth cervical

spinal nerve the phrenic nerve has a

root value of C three four and five and

the cervical spine under five

contributes to the phrenic nerve now let

us see what are the two branches which

come out from the upper trunk

we know that the upper trunk is formed

by the union of the fifth and the sixth

cervical spinal nerves and the upper

trunk of the brachial plexus gives rise

to two important nerves

one is the suprascapular nerve and the

second nerve is the nerve to subclavius

of course the upper trunk divides into

an anterior division and a posterior

division and you have to remember that

there are no branches which come from

the divisions now we come to what are

the exact branches which come out from

each of these cords we have seen how the

lateral cord is formed we have seen how

the medial cord is formed and we have

also seen how the posterior god is

spawned now we will see what are the

branches which come from the lateral

cord the lateral cord gives rise to

three principal branches namely the

lateral pectoral nerve the lateral root

of the median nerve and the

musculocutaneous nerve the lateral

pectoral nerve the lateral root of the

median nerve and the musculocutaneous

nerve all have a root value of C five

six and seven next we come to the medial

cord the medial cord gives rise to five

nerves these include the medial pectoral

nerve the medial root of the median

nerve the medial cutaneous nerve of the

arm the medial cutaneous nerve of the

forearm and ulnar nerve most nerves from

the medial cord have a root value C 8 T

1 and ulnar nerve has an additional

contribution from the seventh cervical

spinal nerve coming to the posterior

cord the posterior cord also gives rise

to five nerves these include the upper

subscapular the lower subscapular the

Taraka dorsal the axillary nerve and the

radial nerves the upper subscapular and

the lower subscapular nerves

have a root value of C five and six the

Torico dorsal nerve which supplies a big

muscle called the latissimus dorsi has a

root value of c6 c7 and c8 the axillary

nerve which supplies the deltoid and

teres minor has a root value of C five

and six and the radial nerve the largest

nerve of the brachial plexus has a root

value of C five six seven eight and from

the first thoracic spinal nerve now we

shall have a brief overview of the

distribution of the major nerves I will

not talk into the detailed relations and

course of each of these nerves as they

are dealt with in separate lessons

however you have to remember that the

axillary nerve which comes from the

posterior cord is a fairly big nerve

which supplies the deltoid and teres

minor the radial nerve which is the

biggest nerve of the brachial plexus

supplies all the muscles on the extensor

aspect of the arm and the forearm and

the wrist the musculocutaneous nerve

supplies the muscles of the front of the

arm the median nerve is also called as

the laborious nerve and it innervates

all muscles on the front of the forearm

the ulnar nerve a branch from the medial

cord is called as the musician's nerve

and innervates most intrinsic muscles of

the hand so in summary we have these

five important nerves the axillary nerve

which supplies the deltoid the radial

nerve which supplies all the extensors

on the back of the hand and the back of

the forearm and the wrist the

musculocutaneous nerve which is the

nerve of the front of the arm and

supplies the anterior compartment of the

arm the median nerve which supplies the

muscles and the front of the forearm and

the ulnar nerve which is the nerve of

the hand which brings us to a point

which is called as the herbs point which

is formed by the meeting of six nerves

we have studied in the earlier part of

this lesson that the c5 and the c6 roots

unite to form the upper trunk and the

upper trunk gives rise to two divisions

an anterior division and a posterior

division

the upper trunk we have also studied

gives rise to two nerves the

suprascapular nerve and the nerve the

subclavius this point where six nerves

are emerging this point is called as the

herbs point and this point can get

injured in certain injuries of the

brachial plexus and that calls us a

paralysis which is called as herbs

paralysis which we will be discussing in

great detail as we come to the last part

of this particular lesson now it is

important to realize the relation of the

cords of the brachial plexus to the

axillary artery the cords of the

brachial plexus are located in the

axilla and they are closely related to

the axillary artery with respect to the

first part of the axillary artery the

lateral cord and the posterior cord lie

on the lateral aspect of the axillary

artery and the medial cord is related to

the posterior aspect of the axillary

artery the axillary vein lies medial to

the axillary artery the lateral cord at

the posterior cord lying lateral to the

axillary artery and the medial cord

lying posterior to the axillary artery

coming to the second part of the

axillary artery the cords are arranged

in relation to the axillary artery as

per their names that is the posterior

cord lies posterior to the axillary

artery the medial cord lies medial to

the axillary artery and the lateral cord

lies lateral to the axillary artery in

addition the medial pectoral nerve is

also related to the anterior aspect of

the medial cord so in relation to the

second part of the axillary artery we

have the medial cord lying medial to the

axillary artery the posterior cord lying

posterior to the axillary artery and the

lateral cord lying lateral to the

axillary artery of course the axillary

vein lies on the medial aspect of the

axillary artery coming to the third part

we have the branches of the brachial

plexus in relation to the axillary

artery this include on the medial aspect

medial to the axillary vein is the

medial cutaneous nerve of the arm

between the axillary vein

the axillary artery is the medial

cutaneous nerve of the forearm and ulnar

nerve posterior to the axillary artery

or the radial nerve and the axillary

nerve anterior to the axillary artery is

the medial root of the median nerve and

lying lateral to the axillary artery or

the lateral root of the median nerve and

the musculocutaneous nerve these are

important relations which you must

remember during the course of this

listen variations in the formation of

brachial plexus are fairly common

sometimes the brachial plexus is formed

by contributions from the fourth

cervical spinal nerve till the eighth

cervical spinal nerve in which case it

is called as a prefix plexus and occurs

in about 10% of individuals occasionally

the brachial plexus is formed by

contributions from c6 c7 c8 t1 and t2

such a condition is called as a post fix

plexus and also occurs in about 10% of

population while a pre flix plexus does

not create any problems the post fix

plexus in the postfix plexus the first

strip may come press upon the lower

trunk of the brachial plexus and can't

cause neurovascular symptoms in the

upper limb a number of variations in the

formation of the trunk cords and

branches can occur there can be

variations in the relationships to the

scalene muscles and the axillary

arteries and the medial nerve can have

two roots it can have two medial roots

instead of having a medial root and a

lateral root now it is important to

remember that irrespective of the

variations however way the plexus is

formed all terminal branches are almost

always present and supply the same

muscles so that is about the variations

in the brachial plexus

now we shall briefly look at the various

branches which come out from each of the

cause of the brachial plexus let us

start with the lateral cord the first

nerve is the lateral pectoral nerve with

a root value of C five six and seven the

lateral pectoral

of pierces the Clabby pectoral fascia

and innervates the pectoralis major and

the pectoralis minor the next nerve is

the lateral root of the median nerve the

lateral root of the median nerve is

joined by the median root of the median

nerve from the medial cord and together

they form the median nerve which is

lying on the lateral aspect of the

axillary artery the median nerve is

called as the laborers nerve and as I

had mentioned before the median nerve

supplies muscles on the anterior aspect

of the forearm and some muscles of the

thenar eminence the next nerve if you

see this particular picture this is the

pectoralis major underneath the

pectoralis major is the pectoralis minor

this is the axillary sheath containing

the axillary artery the axillary vein

the lateral cord the medial cord and the

posterior cord here is the tendon of

coracobrachialis and the two heads of

biceps a long head and this is the long

head and this is the short head this is

the scapula and this is the

subscapularis muscle and this is the

serratus anterior muscle so you see this

particular nerve here this is the

lateral pectoral nerve which supplies

the pectoralis major as well as the

pectoralis minor the third nerve which

comes from the lateral cord is the

musculocutaneous nerve the

musculocutaneous nerve is the nerve of

the upper arm and supplies

coracobrachialis biceps and brachialis

the peculiarity of this nerve is that

after it supplies the muscles it runs

down the lower aspect of the forearm as

the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forum

and the muscle as it comes into the

upper part of the arm it pierces the

coracobrachialis and then runs laterally

between the biceps and brachialis to the

lateral side of the arm it is important

to remember that the branch to

coracobrachialis is given before the

nerve enters the muscle and the branches

to the biceps and brachialis are given

after the nerve pierces coracobrachialis

so that is about the musculocutaneous

nerve which is the nerve of the arm and

supplies the muscles on the front of the

arm which include the Karaka brachialis

the biceps and the brachialis we now

come to the nerves which form the medial

cord the medial pectoral nerve arises

from the medial cord and anterior to the

artery joints the lateral pectoral nerve

to form a loop and enters the deep

surface of pectoralis minor supply

spectral is minor and then goes on words

to supply the pectoralis major two or

three branches may pierce the pectoralis

minor and others may pass around its

inferior border to end in pectoralis

major so that is about the first nerve

which comes out from the medial cord

namely the medial pectoral nerve we come

to the next nerve from the medial cord

which is the medial root of the median

nerve the medial root of the median

nerve crosses anterior to the axillary

artery and joins with the lateral root

of the median nerve which is coming from

the lateral cord to form a thick nerve

which is the median nerve the third

nerve which comes from the medial cord

is the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm

with the root value of c8 - t1 it runs

down medial to the axillary artery to

the axillary artery and vein and

supplies the skin on the front and the

medial aspect of the upper arm it

supplies the area on the skin on the

front and the medial aspect of the upper

arm and sometimes this medial cutaneous

now of the arm is entirely replaced by

the lateral cutaneous nerve of the

second intercostal nerve and that nerve

is called as the intercostal brachial

nerve so that is about the medial

cutaneous nerve of the arm we come to

this picture I want you to have a look

at this particular picture here you are

seeing the lateral chord this is the

posterior cord and this is the medial

cord and the medial cord runs down and

gives this first branch which is the

medial pectoral nerve notice the second

branch of the medial cord which is

forming a loop with the lateral cord

this one this is the medial pectoral

nerve

a loop which is linking with the lateral

pectoral nerve in front of the axillary

artery the next branch from the medial

cord is this particular nerve which is

the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm

this is lying medial to the axillary

artery and is joined by the intercostal

brachial nerve lying in the gap between

the axillary are accelerating on the

medial aspect and the axillary artery

and the lateral aspect are two nerves

the ulnar nerve and the medial cutaneous

nerve of the forum lying on a posterior

aspect of the axillary artery is the

largest nerve of the brachial plexus the

radial nerve coming to the lateral

aspect of the axillary artery are two

nerves here this is the median nerve

which is formed by the union of the

lateral root of the median nerve and the

medial root of the median nerve and

together this is the median nerve and

finally most laterally is the

musculocutaneous nerve which is coming

from the lateral cord of the brachial

plexus the next nerve from the medial

cord is the medial cutaneous nerve of

the forearm with a root value of c8 - t1

the medial cutaneous nerve of the

forearm runs in this way it runs down

between the axillary artery and the vein

it pierces the deep fascia halfway down

to the elbow and provides sensory

innervation to the skin of the lower arm

and the ulnar border of the forearm and

part of this nerve can be used in nerve

drafts here as it does not give any

branches this particular nerve you see

here this is the medial cutaneous nerve

of the forearm which pierces the deep

fascia here and runs down the medial s

aspect of the ulnar border of the forum

and provides sensory innervation in this

entire area the final nerve which comes

from the medial cord probably the most

important nerve is the ulnar nerve the

ulnar nerve is the largest branch of the

medial cord and runs between the

axillary artery and the vein behind the

medial continious nerve of the forum it

passes down the medial aspect of the arm

and then runs under the medial

epicondyle and it enters the forearm by

you're saying the two heads of flexor

carpi ulnaris and run superficial to the

flexor retinaculum and innervates two

muscles of the front of the forearm that

is the flexor carpi ulnaris and the

medial half of flexor digitorum

profundus and more importantly the ulnar

nerve is called as the nerve of the hand

and it innervates almost all the

intrinsic muscles of the hand it also

supplies the skin of the medial half of

the hand and the medial one and half

fingers you can again see in this big

picture the ulnar nerve is lying in the

gap between the axillary vein which is

on the medial side and the axillary

artery which is on the lateral side this

of course

lying on a little anterior aspect is the

medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm

which now brings us to the branches of

the posterior cord the first branch from

the posterior cord is the upper

subscapular nerve with the root value of

c5 and 6 you see in this picture this

here is the upper subscapular nerve

which is supplying the subscapularis the

subscapularis enters it enters the

subscapularis at a high level and is

frequently double lower down you see

another nerve here this is the lower

subscapular nerve with the same root

value of c5 and 6 this nerve also

supplies the lower part of subscapularis

and additionally it's supplied series

major

note that there is a third nerve the

toric or dorsal nerve which is

originating from the posterior cord in

the interval between the upper

subscapular nerve and the lower

subscapular nerve look at this relation

carefully the first nerve which comes

out from the posterior cord is the upper

subscapular nerve then is the toric or

dorsal nerve which is supplying the

latissimus dorsi and next is the lower

subscapular nerve which is supplying the

lower part of subscapularis this is the

picture showing the branches of the

posterior cord this is the upper

subscapular nerve supplying the upper

part of subscapularis this is the Torico

dorsal nerve supplying the latissimus

dorsi this is the lower subscapular

nerve which is supplying the lower part

of subscapularis

as well as

steals major and this is another nerve

the axillary nerve which passes through

the quadrangular space along with the

posterior circumflex humeral vessels to

supply the deltoid and the teres minor

and this of course is the largest ranch

of the posterior cord the radial nerve

which runs in the radial groove on the

posterior aspect of the humerus the

Torico dorsal nerve as we have seen

originates in the interval between the

upper subscapular nerve and the lower

subscapular nerve and it accompanies the

subscapular artery along the posterior

axillary wall and supplies a large

muscle the latus amaz dorsi we come to

an important nerve nerve the axillary

nerve the axillary nerve as seen here it

travels along with the posterior

circumflex humeral vessels and passes

through the quadrangular space and it

supplies a particular branch to the

shoulder joint and supplies primarily

two important muscles namely the deltoid

and teres minor

it provides innervation to the skin over

the deltoid muscle as it passes through

the quadrangular space the axillary

nerve divides into two branches and

anterior branch and a posterior branch

the anterior branch runs along with the

posterior circumflex humeral vessels and

supplies deltoid and skin over the

middle of the deltoid so it's giving

motor branches to the deltoid and it is

giving sensory branches to the skin over

the middle of the deltoid muscle

additionally there is a posterior branch

which continues as the lateral apakah

taneous nerve of the arm this posterior

branch supplies the posterior and lower

parts of the deltoid and it also

supplies the teres minor so you have the

anterior branch which is supplying the

anterior aspect of the deltoid and is

giving cutaneous supply to the skin over

the middle of the deltoid and you have a

posterior branch which is supplying the

lower parts of the deltoid the posterior

parts of the deltoid and it is also

giving a branch to the teres minor so

these are the branches of the axillary

nerve and anterior branch and a

posterior branch which now brings us to

the thickest nerve of the post

in fact the thickest nerve and the

entire brachial plexus which is the

radial nerve it is derived from cervical

nerves see five six seven eight and t1

it courses through the axilla through

the triangular space along with the

profunda break high artery it enters the

radial groove to pass between the lung

and the medial heads of triceps on the

posterior aspect of the arm it passes in

the lateral part of the cubital fossa

and divides into two nerves a

superficial branch and a deep branch the

superficial branch is sensory and the

deep branch supplies the extensors as I

had mentioned earlier the radial nerve

supplies all extensors on the posterior

aspect that is the extensors on the back

of the harm extensors on the back of the

forearm and the extensors of the wrist

all are supplied by the radial nerve you

can see in this picture that all muscles

on the back of the arm the back of the

forearm and the extensors of the wrist

all these muscles are supplied by the

radial nerve so to summarize what we

have studied so far is how is the

brachial plexus formed the brachial

plexus is formed by the ventral rami of

c5 c6 c7 c8 and t1 the roots unite to

form trunks the upper trunk is formed by

the roots of c5 and 6 the middle trunk

is formed by the root of c7 and the

lower trunk is formed by the roots of c8

and t1 each of these trunks divided into

two divisions an anterior division and a

posterior division the anterior

divisions of the upper trunk and the

middle trunk form the lateral cord the

anterior division of the lower trunk

forms the medial cord and the posterior

divisions of all the three trunks from

the posterior cord we have seen the

various branches which come out from

each of these cords the lateral cord

gives rise to the lateral pectoral nerve

the lateral root of the median nerve and

the musculocutaneous nerve the medial

cord gives rise to the medial pectoral

nerve the medial route of the median

nerve the medial cutaneous nerve of the

arm

the medial cutaneous nerve of the

forearm and the ulnar nerve the

posterior cord gives rise to the upper

subscapular nerve the lower subscapular

nerve the Torico dorsal nerve the

axillary nerve and the radial nerve we

have seen the relations of the cords to

the brachial plexus to the axillary

artery we have seen how the relations

are different in relation to the first

part of the axillary artery how the

relations are different with respect to

the second part of the axillary artery

and how the various branches of the

brachial plexus are related to the third

part of the axillary artery we have seen

the variations which occur in the

brachial plexus we have seen what is a

prefixed plexus when there is

contribution from d4 and we have seen a

post fixed plexus when there is a

contribution from the second thoracic

spinal nerve now we shall study the

applied aspects of the brachial plexus

we will be studying the following

clinical conditions lesion of the long

thoracic nerve of Bell lesion of the

suprascapular nerve injury to the

axillary nerve upper trunk palsy lower

trunk palsy acute brachial plexus

neuritis and a clinical procedure called

the brachial plexus block so let us

start with the first clinical condition

a lesion of the long torus ignor of bell

the commonest causes of injury to the

long tarea signal is sudden heavy loads

on a shoulder and carrying heavy loads

on the shoulder paralysis of the long

terracing nerve manifests as ringing of

the scapula it may be the only clinical

manifestation if you ask a patient to

press against a wall you can see that

the medial border of the scapula becomes

very very prominent so this is how the

paralysis of the long thoracic nerve is

demonstrated by asking the patient to

push against a wall the main function of

serratus anterior is to keep the medial

border of the scapula in close a

position to the thoracic wall this is

the serratus anterior and the main

action of this muscle is to keep the

medial border

of the scapula in a position through the

thoracic wall the moment there is loss

of nerve supply to this particular

muscle when a patient presses against

the wall the medial border of the

scapula will come out and protrude

outside and this is what is called as

winging of the scapula the next

condition is the lesion of the

suprascapular nerve the suprascapular

nerve passes in a notch which is called

as the suprascapular notch and it is

commonly involved in what is called as

an entrapment neuropathy where it gets

compressed in the suprascapular notch

trauma to the scapula and the shoulder

is a frequent cause of injury to the

suprascapular nerve and this manifests

as pain in the shoulder region the

suprascapular nerve supplies

supraspinatus and infraspinatus

supraspinatus has a role in the

initiation of abduction and

infraspinatus is a lateral rotator of

the shoulder joint so an entrapment of

the suprascapular nerve will cause

difficulty in abduction and will cause

difficulty in lateral rotation because

of the involvement of these two muscles

namely the supraspinatus and the

infraspinatus next we come to the

lesions of the axillary nerve the

axillary nerve is commonly involved in

dislocations of the shoulder joint

it is commonly involved in the fractures

of the upper end of the humerus and by

misplaced injections into the deltoid

muscle it manifests as wasting and

weakness of the deltoid with the loss of

contour of the shoulder the abduction of

the shoulder is affected because the

deltoid muscle is paralyzed and it is

one of the strongest abductors of the

shoulder joint the moment there is a

damage to the axillary nerve the

abduction of the shoulder joint gets

affected there is the sensory loss on

the outer aspect of the upper arm below

the acromion this we have studied

earlier in the lesson that the anterior

division of the axillary nerve after

supplying the anterior parts of the

deltoid supply skin on the outer aspects

of the deltoid muscle so there is a

sensory loss in this area and there is a

weak lateral rotation because of the

involved

and of teres minor again we had studied

earlier in the lesson that the posterior

division of the axillary nerve in

addition to supplying the posterior

parts of deltoid also supplies teres

minor and teres minor is an important

lateral rotator so there is once there

is paralysis of T DS minor the lateral

rotation becomes weak so that is about

the involvement of the axillary nerve

which brings us to a very important

topic which is called as the upper trunk

paralysis it is also called as the herbs

paralysis the site of the injury is the

herbs point which we have seen earlier

in the lesson is formed by the union of

c-56 and roots which formed upward trunk

and upward front giving rise to two

divisions the anterior division and the

posterior division and two nerves

emerging out from the upper trunk namely

the suprascapular nerve and the nerve to

subclavius the nerves arising from the

upper trunk are involved the lateral and

posterior cords of the brachial plexus

involved and the nerve roots which are

involved are c5 and c6 spinal nerves and

the mechanism of injury is due to an

undue separation of the head from the

shoulder as occurs during a difficult

birth injury difficult birth procedure

in which the the fetal head is stretched

thus stretching the neck against the

shoulder this is undue separation of the

head from the neck this also happens in

a fall from a motorcycle in which the

neck is stretched against the shoulder

there is an undue and wide separation of

the neck from the shoulder this results

in the tearing of the upper part of the

brachial plexus and the injury is

usually in the region of the herbs point

so what are the roots which get involved

the roots which usually get involved on

the c5 the c6 and sometimes the C 7th

root and the muscles which are paralyzed

include when the upper trunk is damaged

there is the involvement of the

suprascapular nerve the suprascapular

nerve as with mentioned just before

supplies two important muscles the

supraspinatus and the infraspinatus the

supraspinatus has a role in the

action of the shoulder joint so the

abduction of the shoulder joint becomes

weak the infraspinatus has a role in the

lateral rotation of the humerus so the

lateral rotation becomes weak because of

the paralysis of infraspinatus from the

lateral cord the musculocutaneous nerve

gets involved so there is loss of nerve

supply to the biceps and brachialis

biceps is an important flexor at the

elbow joint it is also an important

supinator at the elbow joint so the

moment the biceps is paralyzed flexion

at the elbow joint is affected and

supination at the elbow joint is

affected the brachialis also causes

flexion at the elbow joint

elbow joint and the moment the

brachialis is paralyzed flexion at the

elbow joint is affected from the

posterior cord that is the involvement

of the axillary and the radial nerves

the axillary nerve supplies the deltoid

and the teres minor so abduction and

lateral rotation of the shoulder joint

is affected the radial nerve supplies

brachioradialis which causes flexion at

the elbow joint and supination from

pronation so the moment the radial nerve

is involved the flexion at the elbow

joint is affected and the act of

supination from pronation that is

affected and finally the supinator is

supplied by the radial nerve and the

moment supinator is paralyzed supination

is affected and the radioulnar joints so

what you have is the position of the

hand is in this typical position which

is called as the policeman stiff hand or

a waiter stiff hand in herbs paralysis

the position of the limp is one in which

the arm hangs by the side it is adapted

because there is no abduction due to the

loss of deltoid and supraspinatus it is

medially rotated because there is no

Lotte lateral rotation provided by the

teres minor and the deltoid there is

extension at the elbow because there is

no flexion due to the loss of biceps and

brachialis and the forearm is pronated

there is no separation because of loss

of supinator

biceps and brachial radialis so this is

the position of the hand in case of

herbs paralysis

which brings us to a similar condition

which is called as the backpackers pal

see a heavy load on the shoulder

produces the same effect of separating

the neck from the shoulder a heavy load

here produces the same effect of

separating the neck from the shoulder

and this usually occurs in those have

varying prolonged wearing of a heavy

backpack or sudden loading of a heavy

backpack on weak shoulder muscles

this causes micro trauma to the superior

trunk of the brachial plexus and results

in motor and sensory deficits in

distribution of the musculocutaneous and

radial nerves includes severe muscle

spasms in the upper limb the next

paralysis which occurs is the clomp case

paralysis or an injury to the lower

trunk the lower trunk that is formed by

the union of c8 and T when spinal nerves

this is the one which gets injured and

Trump rump case paralysis and the cord

which is involved here is the medial

cord and the nerves which commonly get

affected on the ulnar nerve and the

medial cutaneous nerve of the arm and

the medial cutaneous nerve of the forum

the cause of injury is a birth injury or

an undue abduction of the arm while

holding on to something with the hands

during fall from a height a cervical rib

can also cause compression of the lower

trunk of the brachial plexus and caused

this particular injury let's have a look

and look at some of the pictures in

which this lower trunk of the brachial

plexus gets affected this is a common

kind of birth injury in which the hand

is pulled along for the delivery and

this is as this causes a stretching of

the lower trunk of the brachial plexus

this action of pulling the hang out

during delivery causes stretching at the

lower trunk lower part of the brachial

plexus a fall from a height an

individual who is falling from a height

clutching on to something suddenly this

will cause again a stretching of the

lower trunk of the brachial plexus the

presence of a cervical drip you can see

in this particular picture this is the

first trip I normally

the axillary artery and the lower trunk

of the brachial plexus lie on the first

strip the presence of a cervical rib

here will elevate the lower trunk of the

brachial plexus along with the axillary

artery and will cause compression of the

lower trunk leading to this paralysis

which is called as the clomp kiss

paralysis in which the main nerves which

are affected include the ulnar nerve the

medial cutaneous nerve of the arm and

the medial calcaneal snow of the forearm

we have seen that the ulnar nerve is

involved this causes paralysis of the

intrinsic muscles of the hand and the

ulnar flexors of the wrist and the

fingers the clump case paralysis or a

lower trunk injury manifests as what is

called as the ulnar claw hand that is

the medial two fingers are more affected

and the ulnar claw hand manifests as

hyperextension at the

metacarpophalangeal joint and flexion at

the interphalangeal joints the ulnar

nerve supplies two important sets of

muscles in the hand namely the

lumbricals and the inter O'Shay

that is the medial to lumbricals are

supplied by the ulnar nerve and the in

terrassa are also supplied by the lump

by the ulnar nerve these muscles are

inserted into the dorsal digital

expansion and the main action of these

muscles that is the medial to lumbricals

along with the in terrassa caused

flexion and the inter

metacarpophalangeal joint and extension

and the interphalangeal joints so the

main action of the lumbricals are in

terrassa through their action on the

dorsal digital expansion is a flexion at

the metacarpophalangeal joints and an

extension at the interphalangeal joints

the moment there is a loss of nerve

supply to the lumbricals in the in

terrassa

the opposite muscles take over and what

results is the opposite action that is

an extension at the metacarpophalangeal

joints and deflection at the

interphalangeal joints this causes what

is called as the claw hand now one of

the tests used to determine the

paralysis of the ulnar nerve is what is

called as a fromand sign when we ask a

patient to hold a piece of paper between

the thumb and the finger this is the

normal action of adduction

the adduction is carried out by a muscle

which is called as adductor pollicis and

adductor pollicis is supplied by the

ulnar nerve so you if you ask a patient

with an intact ulnar nerve to hold a

piece of paper between the thumb and the

finger this is what the patient will do

he will clasp the paper between the

thumb and the finger and this is this

action is caused by the adductor

pollicis this is the action of adduction

and this is caused by the adductor

pollicis which is supplied by the intact

ulnar nerve if the ulnar nerve is

damaged since this particular action is

not possible this action of adduction is

not possible the patient will try to

hold the paper like this due to over

action of the flexor pollicis longus

this is what is called as from and

signed positive and if there is an

intact ulnar nerve the patient will hold

the paper like this in which indicates

that the ulnar nerve is intact so this

is what is called as a Froman signed

negative and this is a Froman sign

positive which indicates the paralysis

of the ulnar nerve in addition to this

ulnar claw hand there is also a loss of

sensory innervation on the ulnar side of

the hand and the forum so that is

scrumptious paralysis so if we compare

the upper trunk paralysis the upper

trunk paralysis is what is called as

Erbs palsy it caused it is caused by

injury to the upper trunk of the

brachial plexus and the roots which are

involved are c-56

the deformity which is present in an

upper trunk mal see is what is called as

a waiter step and in which the upper

limb is adducted medially rotated

extended in opposition to that in when

you compare the lower trunk injury the

result of a lower trunk injury is what

is called as the claw hand this is

primarily due to damage of the lower

trunk of the brachial plexus in which

the c8 and the T were nerves get

involved the main nerves which are

involved on the ulnar nerve and the

medial continious nerve of the arm and

the medial cutaneous nerve of the

forearm and the deformity which results

from a lower trunk injury is what is

called as the claw Han

now we come to a couple of things which

are involved along with the lower trunk

injury an injury to the lower trunk of

the brachial plexus also results in the

Horner's syndrome the Horner syndrome a

- a disruption of the sympathetic fibers

to the head and neck which travel via

the first thoracic spinal nerve the

Horner syndrome has the following

manifestations ptosis because of loss of

innervation to the visceral part of

levator palpebrae superioris meiosis due

to the loss of dilators pupil a

anhidrosis because of loss of

innervation to the sweat glands which

are supplied by the sympathetic fibers

an apparent pseudo enough thalamus the

eye appears shrunken into the socket

loss of the Celia spinal reflex that is

pinching the skin at the nape of the

neck does not produce a dilatation of

pupil because of the loss of dilated

pupil a in addition in small children

there is the occurrence of heterochromia

which is due to the interference with

melanin pigmentation of the iris next we

come to a condition which is called as

the hyper abduction syndrome which is

result of a prolonged hyper abduction of

the shoulder joint which occurs in

manual tasks like painting a ceiling in

which there is a prolonged abduction of

the upper limb this causes a compression

of the axillary nerves and the vessels

and the nerves between the coracoid

process and the pectoralis minor tendon

the common neurological symptoms include

a pain radiating down the arm numbness

paresthesias and tingling sensations and

muscle weakness the arterial obstruction

causes upper limb ischemia and

distinction of the superficial veins and

this condition is usually relieved by

rest and pain killers so the main thing

which happens in the hyper abduction

syndrome is the compression of the

axillary vessels and nerves between the

coracoid process and the pectoralis

minor tendon so usually relieved by

wrist no specific treatment is required

other than a few

pain killers and the condition settles

down by itself another condition which

is involved which involves the brachial

plexus is the acute brachial plexus

neuritis it is a neurological disorder

of unknown cause and there is a sudden

onset of severe pain around the shoulder

and usually it begins in night and

results in severe muscle weakness and it

usually involves the muscle supplied by

the upper trunk of the brachial plexus

and the neuritis is usually preceded by

an upper respiratory tract infection or

vaccination or some nonspecific trauma

this usually is a self-limiting

condition non-steroidal

anti-inflammatory drugs and gabapentin

or pre gabapentin are the drugs which

can be used to relieve the symptoms and

the condition resolves over a period of

time finally we come to our clinical

procedure which is the brachial plexus

block this procedure involves

installation of Denon esthetically agent

or on various parts of the brachial

plexus and it's useful for surgery on

the upper limb without general

anesthesia the approaches where the

brachial plexus can be blocked with an

anesthetic agent include an inter

scalene approach where the local

anaesthetic is infiltrated into this

area a supraclavicular area where the

trunks of the brachial plexus are or

anesthetized by instilling the

anesthetic agent and finally an axillary

approach of these three approaches the

supraclavicular approach for brachial

plexus block is the one which is most

commonly used with this we now come to

the end of this topic on the brachial

plexus thank you
