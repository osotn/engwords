The mad hatter ' s tea party
---------------------------
There was a tree in front of the house. Under the tree was a big table with
a lot of chairs round it. But there were only three at the table: the Mad
Hatter, the March Hare and a large brown mouse. The Mouse sat between the Mad
Hatter and the March Hare. It was asleep, so they talked over its head.
 
When they saw Alice, they cried: No, no you can't sit here! There isn't a place for you!
There are a lot of places. Alice said. She sat down in a chair at one end of the table.

Have some wine. the Mad Hatter said politely.
Alice looked round the table but there was only tea.
I don't see any wine. she answered.
