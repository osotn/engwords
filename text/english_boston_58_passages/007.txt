Lesson 2 - Food.
Passage 3. Comfort food.
It's natural for people to eat when they're hungry, but people eat for other
reasons, too. Do you ever eat because you're with friends and everyone else is
eating? Do you ever eat because you feel tired, or because you're under stress?
Many people do. Maybe they have too much to do, or they're having problems in
a relationship. So they eat to feel better.
But they don't eat just anything. They want a specific kind of food. They want
food that helps them relax. They want comfort food.
What is comfort food? For most people, it's food that is easy to prepare and
easy to eat. Eating it gives them a warm feeling.
It's often a type of food that they loved as children. Maybe they used to eat
it at specific times or places. Maybe it's food their mother of father used to
make.
Comfort food makes people feel, " Somebody's taking care of me."
Researchers at the University of Illinois did a survey on comfort food in
the United States. They asked over 1,000 people about it. They wanted to know
two things:
What comfort foods did people want, and when did they want them? The results of
the survey were rather surprising.
The researchers expected people's favorite comfort food to be soft and warm, like,
for example, the most popular comforts foods in Japan, _miso soup and _soba noodles.
