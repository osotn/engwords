----------------------------
1.1 Axiom systems

Logic is the study of reasoning; and mathematical logic is the study of the type
of reasoning done by mathematicians.
The conspicuous feature of mathematics, as opposed to other sciences, is the use
of proofs instead of observations.
Nevertheless, it is clearly impossible to prove all mathematical law.
The first laws which one accepts cannot be proved, since there are no earlier
laws from which they can be proved. Hence we have certain first laws, called
axioms, which we accept without proof; the remaining laws, called theorems, are
proved from the axioms.

---------------------------
1.2 Formal systems

An axiom (or theorem) may be viewed in two ways.
It may be viewed as a sentence, i.e., as the object which appears on paper when
we write down the axiom, or as the meaning of a sentence, i.e, the fact with
is expressed by the axiom.

Proofs which deal with concrete objects in a constructive manner are said to be
finitary. A proof is finitary if we can visualize. Of course, neither description
is very precise; but we can apply them in many cases to decide whether or not
a particular proof is finitary.

Abstract mathematics is introduced in order to obtain finitary results in an
easier or more elegant manner.

The study of axioms and theorems as sentences is called the syntactical study
of axiom systems; the study of the meaning of these sentences is called the
semantical study of axiom systems.

To guide us in our syntactical study, we introduce the notation of a formal
system. The first part of a formal system is its language. We generally use
artificial languages for our formal systems.
To specify a language, we must first of all specify its symbols.
Any finite sequence of symbols of a language is called an expression of that
language. A symbol may appear several times in an expression; each such
appearance is called an occurrence of that symbol in the expression.
It is possible for one expression to appear within another expression.

A proof by:
    - induction on theorems;
    - induction on objects in a collection;

------------------------------------------
1.3 Syntactical variables

Variables are another important type of symbol used in analysis texts.
Unlike a name, which has only one meaning, a variable has many meanings.
Variable keeps the same meaning throughout any one context.
Syntactical variable may mean any expression of the language.

-----------------------------------
2.1 Functions and predicates

Our first task is to describe the languages to be used in these formal systems.
Logical and nonlogical concepts.

            2 + 1 < 4
2, 1, 4 represent particular natural numbers
+       representing an object which associates with each pair (a, b) of natural numbers
        a third natural number, namely, the sum of a and b.
<       representing some object which distinguishes between those pairs (a, b) of
        natural numbers for which a is less than b and those pair (a, b) for which a
        is not less than b.

A set or class is a collection of objects.

Let N be the set of natural numbers.
Then + represents a binary function from N to N
     < represents a binary predicate in N
We can also think of 1,2,4 as representing 0-ary functions from N to N.

    = called the equality predicate in A.

----------------------------------------------
2.2 Truth functions

Symbol & to mean   and.

    A & B is for know is true or false.

T and F call truth values.

A truth function is a function from the set of truth values to the set of truth value.
There is a binary truth function H&, then H&(a, b) is the truth value of A & B.
    H&(T, T) = T    H&(T, F) = H&(F, T) = H&(F, F) = F

Symbol V to mean or.    A V B.
HV(a, b) - HV is the binary truth function:
    HV(T, T) = HV(T, F) = HV(F, T) = T   HV(F, F) = F

Symbol -> to mean if...then, so A ->B means if A, then B.
In mathematics, we regard a statement if A, then B as being incorrect only when
A is true and B is nevertheless false.
    H->(T, T) = H->(F, T) = H->(F, F) = T   H->(T, F) = F

Symbol <-> to mean iff.
    H->(T, T) = H->(F, F) = T   H->(F, T) = H->(T, F) = F

Symbol ! to mean not.
    H!(T) = F   H!(F) = T

    H->(a, b) = HV(H!(a), b)

    A & B  = !(A -> !B)
    A <-> B = (A -> B) & (B -> A)

-----------------------------------------------
2.3 Variables and quantifiers

As variables, we use the symbols x,y,z and w, adding primes to form new variables
when they are needed.

Symbol ∀ means for all individuals.
Symbol ∃ means for some individual.

-----------------------------------------
2.4 First order languages

equality symbol =
0-ary function symbol is called a constant

A function symbol or a predicate symbol other than = is called a nonlogical symbol.

A designator is an expression which is either a term or a formula.

We say that two expressions are compatible if one of them can be obtained by
adding some expression to the right end of the other.

Lemma 1. If u1...un => u'1...u'n are designators and u1...un and u'1...u'n are compatible,
hen ui is u'i for i = 1,...,n.

Formation Theorem: Every designator can be written in the form uv1...vn, where
u is a symbol of index n and v1,...vn are designators, in one and only one way.

Lemma 2: Every occurrence of a symbol in a designator u begins an occurrence of
a designator in u.

Occurrence Theorem: Let u be a symbol of index n, and let v1,...,vn be designators.
Then any occurrence of a designator v in uv1,...,vn is either all uv1...vn or a part
of one of the vi.

----------------------
2.5 Structures

First order language consists of a universe and meaning of the appropriate sort
for each nonlogical symbol.
Let L be a first order language: Structure A for L consists:
    -   A nonempty set consists |U|, called the universe of A

An expression is variable free if it contains no variables.


----------------------------
2.6 Logical axioms and rules

A logical axiom is a formula which is:
    - a propositional axiom
    - an identity axiom
    - equality axiom
