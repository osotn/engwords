chapter one my first sea journey before i begin my story
0:08
i would like to tell you a little about myself i was born in the year 1632
0:17
in the city of york in the north of england my father was german but he came to live
0:25
and work in england soon after that he married my mother who
0:32
was english her family name was robinson
0:38
so when i was born they called me robinson after her
0:46
my father did well in his business and i went to a good school
0:52
he wanted me to get a good job and live a quiet comfortable life but i didn't want that
1:01
i wanted adventure and an exciting life i want to be a sailor and go to sea
1:09
i told my mother and father they were very unhappy about this
1:17
please don't go my father said you won't be happy you know sailors have
1:25
a difficult and dangerous life and because i loved him and he was
1:32
unhappy i tried to forget about the sea
1:37
but i couldn't forget and about a year later i saw a friend in town
1:46
his father had a ship and my friend said to me we're sailing to london
1:53
tomorrow why don't you come with us
1:58
and so on september the 1st 1651 i went to hull
2:07
the next day we sailed for london but a few days later there was a strong
2:15
wind the sea was rough and dangerous and the ship went up and down up
2:23
and down i was very ill and very afraid
2:30
oh i don't want to die i cried i want to live
2:38
if i live i'll go home and never go to sea again
2:45
the next day the wind dropped and the sea was quiet and beautiful
2:51
again well bob my friend laughed
2:56
how do you feel now the wind wasn't too bad
3:02
what i cried it was a terrible storm oh
3:09
that wasn't a storm my friend answered just a little wind forget it
3:18
come and have a drink after a few drinks with my friend i felt
3:25
better i forgot about the danger and decided not to go home
3:32
i didn't want my friends and family to laugh at me
3:38
i stayed in london for some time but i still wanted to go to sea
3:45
so when the captain of a ship asked me to go with him to guinea in africa i agreed
3:53
and so i went to sea for the second time
3:59
it was a good ship and everything went well at first
4:04
but i was very ill again then when we were near the canary
4:10
islands a turkish pirate ship came after us
4:16
they were famous thieves of the sea at that time there was a long hard fight but when it
4:24
finished we and the ship were prisoners
4:29
the turkish captain and his men took us to sally in morocco
4:38
they wanted to sell us as slaves in the markets there
4:44
but in the end the turkish captain decided to keep me for himself
4:52
and took me home with him this was a sudden and terrible change in
4:58
my life i was now a slave and this
5:04
turkish captain was my master
5:13
[Music]
5:18
chapter 2 down the coast of africa
5:25
for two long years i lived the life of a slave
5:32
i worked in the house and the garden and every day i plan to escape
5:39
but it was never possible i thought about it day and night
5:47
my master liked to go fishing in a little boat and he always took me
5:53
with him a man called murli and a young boy
6:00
also went with us one day my master said to us some of my friends
6:09
want to go fishing tomorrow get the boat ready
6:14
so we put a lot of food and drink on the boat and the next morning
6:21
we waited for my master and his friends but when my master arrived he was alone
6:31
my friends don't want to go fishing today he said to me but you go
6:39
with murli and the boy and catch some fish for our supper tonight
6:47
yes master i answered quietly but inside i was excited
6:56
perhaps now i can escape i said to myself
7:04
my master went back to his friends and we took the boat out to sea
7:13
for a time we fished quietly and then i moved carefully behind
7:20
murli and knocked him into the water
7:25
swim i cried swim to the shore my master
7:32
liked to shoot seabirds and so there were guns on the boat
7:39
quickly i took one of these guns
7:47
and i shouted to him go back to the shore you can swim there it's not too far
7:56
i won't hurt you but if you come near the boat i'll shoot you through the head
8:05
so murli turned and swam back to the shore as quickly as he could
8:13
then i said to the boy zuri if you help me i'll be a good friend to
8:21
you if you don't help me i'll push you into the sea too
8:29
but zuri was happy to help me i'll go all over the world with you he
8:35
cried i wanted to sail to the canary islands
8:42
but i was afraid to go too far from the shore it was only a small boat
8:49
and so we sailed on the south for some days we had very little water and it was
8:58
dangerous country here with many wild animals
9:04
we were afraid but we often had to go on shore to get more water once
9:11
i used a gun to shoot a wild animal i don't know what animal it was
9:18
but it made a good meal for about 10 or 12 days
9:25
we sailed on south down the coast of africa
9:30
then one day we saw some people on the shore strange
9:37
wild people who did not look friendly by now we had very little food
9:45
and we really needed help we were afraid but we had to go on shore
9:53
at first they were afraid of us too perhaps white people never visited this
10:00
coast we did not speak their language of course
10:06
so we used our hands and faces to show that we were hungry
10:13
they came with food for us but then they moved away quickly
10:20
we carried the food to our boat and they watched us
10:25
i tried to thank them but i had nothing to give them
10:31
just then two big wild cats came down to the shore from the
10:36
mountains i think they were leopards
10:42
the people were afraid of these wild cats and the women cried out
10:49
quickly i took a gun and shot one of the animals the second
10:56
wild cat ran back up into the mountains
11:01
guns were new to these african people and they were afraid of the loud noise
11:07
in the smoke but they were happy about the dead wild
11:12
cat i gave them the meat of the dead animal and they gave us more food and water
11:21
we now had a lot of food and water and we sailed on
11:28
eleven days later we came near the cape verde islands we could see them
11:36
but we couldn't get near because there was no wind
11:42
we waited suddenly zuri called to me look
11:49
a ship he was right we called and shouted and sailed our
11:56
little boat as fast as we could but the ship did not see us
12:03
then i remembered the guns which made a lot of smoke a few minutes later the ship saw us
12:12
and turned when we were on the ship the portuguese
12:18
captain listened to my story he was going to brazil and agreed to
12:24
help me but he wanted nothing for his help
12:29
no he said when i tried to pay him perhaps one day someone will help me
12:36
when i need it but he gave me money for my boat
12:42
and for zuri too at first i did not want to sell zuri as
12:49
a slave after all our dangerous adventures together
12:54
but zuri was happy to go to the captain and the captain was a good man
13:01
in 10 years time he said zuri can go free
13:08
when we arrived in brazil three weeks later i said goodbye to the captain and zuri
13:17
left the ship and went to begin a new life
13:24
[Music]
13:33
chapter 3 the storm and the shipwreck
13:41
i stayed in brazil and worked hard for some years
13:46
by then i was rich but also bored one day
13:53
some friends came to me and said we're going to africa to do business
14:00
why don't you come with us we'll all be rich after this journey
14:07
how stupid i was i had an easy comfortable life in brazil
14:14
but of course i agreed and so in 1659
14:20
i went to see again at first all went well
14:28
but then there was a terrible storm for 12 days the wind and the rain didn't
14:34
stop we lost three men in the sea and soon
14:40
the ship had holes in its sides we're all going to die this time
14:47
i said to myself then one morning one of the sailors
14:53
saw land but the next minute our ship hit some sand just under the
15:00
sea the ship could not move and we were
15:06
really in danger now the sea was trying to break the ship
15:11
into pieces and we had very little time quickly we put a boat into the sea and
15:19
got off the ship but the sea was very rough and our
15:24
little boat could not live for long in that wild water
15:30
half an hour later the angry sea turned our boat over and we were all in the water
15:38
i looked round for my friends but i could see nobody
15:43
i was alone that day i was lucky and the sea
15:50
carried me to the shore i could not see the land only mountains
15:56
of water all around me then suddenly i felt the ground
16:02
under my feet another mountain of water came pushed me up the beach and i fell on the
16:10
wet sand at first i was very thankful to be alive
16:18
slowly i got to my feet and went higher up the shore
16:23
from there i looked out to sea i could see our ship but it was wrecked
16:30
and there was nobody near it there was nobody in the water
16:36
all my friends were dead i was alive but in a strange
16:43
wild country with no food no water and no gun
16:51
it was dark now and i was tired i was afraid to sleep on the shore
16:58
perhaps there were wild animals there so i went up into a tree and i stayed
17:05
there all night
17:18
chapter 4 a new life on an island
17:25
when day came the sea was quiet again
17:31
i looked for our ship and to my surprise it was still there and still in one
17:39
piece i think i can swim to it i said to
17:45
myself so i walked down to the sea
17:50
and before long i was at the ship and was swimming rounded
17:57
but how could i get onto it in the end i got in through a hole in
18:04
the side but it wasn't easy
18:09
there was a lot of water in the ship but the sand under the sea
18:14
was still holding the ship in one place the back of the ship was high out of the
18:21
water and i was very thankful for this because all the ship's food was there
18:29
i was very hungry so i began to eat something at once
18:35
then i decided to take some of it back to the shore with me but how could i get it there
18:42
i looked around the ship and after a few minutes i found some long pieces of wood
18:51
i tied them together with rope then i got the things that i wanted from the
18:57
ship there was a big box of food rice
19:03
and salted meat and hardships bread
19:08
i also took many strong knives and other tools the ship's
19:15
sails and ropes paper pens books
19:22
and seven guns now i needed a little sail from the ship
19:29
and then i was ready slowly and carefully i went back to the shore
19:38
it was difficult to stop my things from falling into the sea
19:43
but in the end i got everything onto the shore
19:50
now i needed somewhere to keep my things
19:55
there were some hills around me so i decided to build myself a little
20:01
house on one of them i walked to the top of the highest hill
20:06
and looked down i was very unhappy because i saw then
20:13
that i was on an island there were two smaller islands a few miles away
20:20
and after that only the sea just the sea for mile after mile
20:28
after mile after a time i found a little cave
20:35
in the side of a hill in front of it there was a good place to make a home
20:43
so i used the ship's sails rope and pieces of wood and after a lot of
20:50
hard work i had a very fine tent
20:56
the cave at the back of my tent was a good place to keep my food
21:02
and so i called it my kitchen that night i went to sleep in my new
21:10
home the next day i thought about the
21:17
possible dangers on the island were there wild animals and perhaps
21:24
wild people too on my island i didn't know but i was very afraid
21:34
so i decided to build a very strong fence
21:39
i cut down young trees and put them in the ground
21:44
in a half circle around the front of my tent
21:49
i used many of the ship's ropes too and in the end my fence was as strong
21:56
as a stone wall nobody could get over it through it or round it
22:06
making tents and building fences is hard work
22:11
i needed many tools to help me so i decided to go back to the ship
22:18
again and get some more things
22:23
i went back 12 times but soon after my twelfth visit there
22:29
was another terrible storm the next morning when i looked out to
22:35
sea there was no ship when i saw that i was very unhappy
22:44
why am i alive and why are all my friends dead i asked myself
22:52
what will happen to me now alone on this island without friends
22:59
how can i ever escape from it then i told myself that i was lucky
23:08
lucky to be alive lucky to have food and tools
23:13
lucky to be young and strong but i knew that my island was somewhere
23:21
off the coast of south america ships did not often come down this coast
23:28
and i said to myself i'm going to be on this island for a
23:33
long time so on a long piece of wood
23:39
i cut these words i came here on the 30th of september
23:48
1659 after that i decided to make a cut for
23:54
each day
24:07
chapter five learning to live alone
24:15
i still needed a lot of things well i said i'm going to have to make
24:22
them so every day i worked
24:28
first of all i wanted to make my cave bigger
24:33
i carried out stone from the cave and after many days hard work
24:41
i had a large cave in the side of the hill
24:46
then i needed a table and a chair and that was my next job
24:53
i had to work on them for a long time
24:58
i also wanted to make places to put all my food and all my tools and guns
25:06
but every time i wanted a piece of wood i had to cut down a tree
25:14
it was long slow difficult work and during the next months i learned to
25:22
be very clever with my tools there was no hurry i had all the time in
25:29
the world i also went out every day and i always
25:36
had my gun with me sometimes i killed a wild animal
25:42
and then i had meat to eat but when it got dark i had to go to bed
25:50
because i had no light i couldn't read or write because i
25:56
couldn't see for a long time i didn't know what to do
26:04
but in the end i learned how to use the fat of dead animals
26:09
to make a light the weather on my island was usually
26:16
very hot and there were often storms and heavy rain
26:23
the next june it rained all the time and i couldn't go out very often
26:32
i was also ill for some weeks but slowly i got better
26:39
when i was stronger i began to go out again
26:46
the first time i killed a wild animal and the second time i caught a big
26:53
turtle i was on the island for ten months
26:59
before i visited other parts of it during those months i worked hard on my
27:07
cave and my house and my fence now i was ready to find out more about
27:14
the rest of the island first i walked along the side of a
27:20
little river there i found open ground without trees
27:28
later i came to more trees with many different fruits
27:33
i decided to take a lot of the fruit and to put it to dry in the sun for a
27:39
time then i could keep it for many months
27:46
that night i went to sleep in a tree for the second time
27:52
and the next day i went on with my journey
27:58
soon i came to an opening in the hills in front of me everything was green
28:06
and there were flowers everywhere there were also a lot of different birds
28:13
and animals i saw that my house was on the worst
28:18
side of the island but i didn't want to move from there it
28:23
was my home now i stayed away for three days and then i
28:30
came home but i often went back to the other greener side of the island
28:39
and so my life went on every month i learned to do or to make
28:46
something new but i had troubles and accidents too
28:52
once there was a terrible storm with very heavy rain
28:57
the roof of my cave fell in and nearly killed me i had to build it up again with many
29:05
pieces of wood i had a lot of food now i
29:12
cooked it over a fire or dried it in the sun so i always had meat during the rainy
29:19
months when i could not go out with a gun i learned to make pots to keep my food
29:27
in but i wanted very much to make a harder stronger pot a pot that would not
29:36
break in a fire i tried many times but i could not do it
29:44
then one day i was lucky i made some new pots and put them in a
29:49
very hot fire they changed color but did not break
29:57
i left them there for many hours and when they were cold again i found
30:02
that they were hard and strong that night i was very happy i had
30:09
hot water for the first time on the island
30:15
by then i also had my own bread that was luck too
30:22
one day i found a little bag we used it on the ship to keep the
30:27
chicken's food in there was still some of the food in the bag and i dropped some of it onto the
30:34
ground a month later i saw something bright
30:40
green there and after six months i had a very small
30:45
field of corn i was very excited
30:51
perhaps now i could make my own bread it was easy to say
30:58
but not so easy to do it is a lot of work to make bread from
31:04
corn many people eat bread but how many
31:09
people can take corn from a field and make bread out of it without help
31:17
i had to learn and to make many new things and it was a year before i cooked and
31:24
ate my first bread during all this time i never stopped
31:32
thinking about escape when i traveled across to the other side
31:37
of the island i could see the other islands and i said
31:42
to myself perhaps i can get there with a boat
31:48
perhaps i can get back to england one day
31:53
so i decided to make myself a boat i cut down a big tree and then began
32:01
to make a long hole in it it was hard work but about six months later i had a very
32:09
fine canoe next i had to get it down to the sea
32:17
how stupid i was why didn't i think before i began work
32:24
of course the canoe was too heavy i couldn't move it i pulled and pushed
32:33
and tried everything but it didn't move i was very unhappy for a long time after
32:40
that that happened in my fourth year on the
32:45
island in my sixth year i did make myself
32:51
a smaller canoe but i did not try to escape in it
32:56
the boat was too small for a long journey and i did not want to die at sea
33:04
the island was my home now not my prison and i was just happy to be alive
33:12
a year or two later i made myself a second canoe on the other side of the island
33:20
i also built myself a second house there and so i had two homes
33:29
my life was still busy from morning to night there were always things to do or to
33:35
make i learned to make new clothes for myself from the skins of dead animals
33:44
they looked very strange it is true but they kept me dry in the rain
33:51
i kept food and tools at both my houses and also wild goats
33:58
there were many goats on the island and i made fields with high fences to keep
34:04
them in they learned to take food from me and
34:09
soon i had goats milk to drink every day
34:14
i also worked hard in my corn fields and so many years went by
34:23
[Music]
34:32
chapter six a footprint
34:37
then one year something strange and terrible happened
34:43
i often walked along the shore and one day i saw something in the sand
34:50
i went over to look at it more carefully and stopped in sudden surprise
34:58
it was a footprint the footprint of a man
35:05
who could this be afraid i looked around me i listened
35:15
i waited nothing i was more and more afraid
35:23
perhaps this man was one of those wild people who killed an eight
35:29
other men i looked everywhere but there was nobody and no other
35:37
footprint i turned and hurried home
35:44
there's someone on my island i said to myself
35:49
perhaps he knows about me perhaps he's watching me now from behind a tree
35:59
perhaps he wants to kill me
36:04
that night i couldn't sleep the next day i got all my guns ready
36:11
and i put more wood and young trees around my house
36:16
nobody could see me now but after 15 years alone on the island
36:23
i was afraid and i did not leave my cave for three days
36:31
in the end i had to go out to milk my goats
36:36
but for two years i was afraid i stayed near my home and i never used
36:44
my guns because i didn't want to make a noise
36:49
i could not forget the footprint but i saw and heard nothing more
36:56
and slowly i began to feel happier
37:02
one day a year later i was over on the west side of the
37:08
island from there i could see the other islands
37:13
and i could also see a boat far out to sea
37:19
if you have a boat i thought it's easy to sail across to this island
37:27
perhaps that explains the footprint it was a visitor from one of the other
37:34
islands i began to move more freely around the island again
37:40
and built myself a third house it was a very secret place in a cave
37:49
no wild man will ever find that i said to myself
37:56
then one year something happened which i can never forget
38:03
i was again on the west side of the island and was walking along the shore
38:09
suddenly i saw something which made me feel ill there were heads
38:16
arms feet and other pieces of men's bodies everywhere for a minute
38:25
i couldn't think and then i understood
38:31
sometimes there were fights between the wild men on the other islands
38:36
then they came here to my island with their prisoners to kill them cook them and eat them
38:44
slowly i went home but i was very angry
38:50
how could men do this for many months i watched carefully for
38:58
the smoke from fires but i didn't see anything
39:03
somehow the wild men came and went and i never saw them
39:10
i was angry and afraid i wanted to shoot them all
39:16
but there were many of them and only one of me
39:22
perhaps i can shoot two or three i said to myself but then
39:30
they will kill and eat me then one morning in my 23rd year on the
39:38
island i was out in my fields and i saw the smoke from a fire
39:44
quickly i went up the hill to watch there were nine men around the fire
39:52
and they were cooking their terrible food then these wild men danced around the
39:59
fire singing and shouting this went on for about two hours then they got into
40:07
their boats and sailed away i went down to the shore and saw the
40:14
blood of the dead men on the sand the next time they come i'm going to
40:21
kill them i said angrily [Music]
40:35
chapter 7 friday
40:41
for two years i never went anywhere without my gun
40:47
i felt lonely and afraid and had many sleepless nights
40:54
one night there was a very bad storm and i thought i heard the sound of guns
41:01
out at sea the next morning i looked out and saw a
41:07
ship it was lying on its side not far from the shore
41:13
quickly i put my little boat in the water and sailed out to it there were two
41:21
dead men on the ship but no one alive the bodies of the other sailors were
41:27
lost in the sea i took some clothes and tools and also a
41:33
box of spanish gold and silver money i was a rich man now but what use was
41:41
money to me i could not buy anything with it i wanted people a friend
41:49
somebody to talk to somebody who could help me escape from my island
41:56
one morning i woke up and made a plan
42:02
i'll try to catch one of the prisoners of the wild men i said to myself he'll be happy to
42:10
be alive and perhaps he'll help me to escape
42:15
i watched day and night but for a year and a half there were no
42:22
boats then one day five boats came
42:28
there were about 30 men and they had two prisoners
42:34
they made their fire on the sand and danced around it
42:39
then they killed one of the prisoners and began to cook that terrible meal
42:47
the second prisoner waited under the trees with two men to watch him
42:54
suddenly the prisoner turned and ran the two men ran after him but the other
43:02
wild men were busy around the fire and did not see what was happening
43:09
the prisoner ran like a wild goat and soon i saw that he was coming near
43:15
the bottom of my hill as fast as i could i ran down the hill
43:22
and jumped out of the trees between the prisoner and the two wild men
43:29
i hit the first man with the wooden end of my gun and he fell down but i had to shoot the
43:37
second man the poor prisoner did not move he was
43:42
afraid of the noise of my gun i called to him and tried to show him
43:50
that i was friendly slowly he moved nearer to me
43:57
but just then the first wild man began to get up from the ground
44:03
then the prisoner spoke and i understood that he wanted my sword
44:09
how happy i was to hear words again i gave him my sword and at once
44:16
he cut off the head of his enemy hurriedly we hid the dead bodies under
44:24
some leaves and then left quickly i took my prisoner to my secret cave
44:32
on the other side of the island and gave him food and drink after that
44:39
he went to sleep he was a fine young man about
44:46
25 years old tall and well built with a kind face and a nice smile
44:54
he had a brown skin black hair bright eyes and strong white teeth
45:03
i decided to give him the name of man friday because i first saw him on a friday
45:12
when he woke up in the morning he ran out to me i was milking my goats in the field
45:20
and he got down on the ground and put his head near my foot
45:26
i understood that he was thanking me and i tried to show him that i was his
45:32
friend i began to teach him to speak english
45:38
and soon he could say his name master and yes and no
45:46
how good it was to hear a man's voice again later that day we went back to my first
45:53
house we went carefully along the beach but there were no boats and no wild men
46:02
just blood and bones all over the sand
46:08
i felt ill but friday wanted to eat the pieces of men's bodies which were still
46:14
on the ground i showed him that this was terrible for me
46:19
and he understood when we got to my house i gave man
46:26
friday some trousers and i made him a coat and a hat
46:32
he liked his new clothes very much then i made him a little tent to sleep
46:38
in but for a few weeks i always took my gun
46:44
to bed with me perhaps friday was still a wild man
46:49
and would try to kill me in the night at first friday was very afraid of my
46:56
gun sometimes he talked to it and asked it not to kill him
47:03
friday was a quick learner and his english got better day by day he helped me with the goats
47:12
and with the work in the cornfields and soon we were good friends
47:18
i enjoyed teaching him and most of all having a friend to talk to this was the
47:25
happiest of all my years on the island friday and i lived together happily for
47:32
three years i told him the story of my adventures
47:37
and about life in england and he told me about his country
47:42
and his people one day we were at the top of the
47:48
highest hill on the island and we were looking out to see
47:53
it was a very clear day and we could see a long way
47:59
suddenly friday began to jump up and down very excited what's the matter
48:06
i said look master look friday cried i can
48:13
see my country look over there
48:18
i looked and there to the northwest between the sea and the sky was a long
48:25
thin piece of land i learned later that it was the island of trinidad
48:33
and that my island was in the mouth of the river orinoco on the north coast of south america
48:41
i began to think again about escape perhaps friday wanted to go home too
48:49
perhaps together we could get to his country but what then would friday still be my
48:56
friend or would his people kill me and eat me
49:02
i took friday to the other side of the island and showed him my big canoe
49:09
it still lay under the trees it was very old now and there were holes
49:15
in the wood could a boat like this sail to your
49:21
country friday i asked him oh yes he answered a boat like this
49:29
can carry a lot of food and drink then we'll make another canoe like it
49:36
and you can go home in it i said but friday looked very unhappy
49:44
why are you angry with me he asked what have i done why do you
49:51
want to send me home but i thought you wanted to go home i
49:57
said yes but you must come with me
50:03
kill me if you want but don't send me away from you
50:09
then i saw that friday was a true friend and so i agreed to go with him
50:17
we began work on the canoe at once friday chose the tree himself
50:24
he understood wood better than i did and we cut it down
50:30
we worked hard and in a month the boat was finished
50:36
two weeks later it was in the sea and we began to get ready for our long
50:46
[Music]
50:52
journey chapter 8 escape from the island
51:01
i was now in my 27th year on the island and i did not want to be there for
51:07
another year we worked hard to get the corn in and to
51:12
make a lot of bread we had dried fruit and salted meat
51:18
and big pots to keep water in one evening friday went out to look for
51:24
a turtle for meat and eggs but in less than an hour he was back
51:31
and he looked very afraid master master he cried
51:38
there's a great ship near the island and men are coming to the shore in a
51:44
boat i jumped up and ran with him down to the
51:49
shore to my great surprise i saw that it was
51:55
an english ship but why was it here
52:00
english ships never came this way perhaps they were pirates
52:07
don't let them see you friday i called we'll hide in the trees and watch
52:14
there were eleven men in the boat but three of them were prisoners
52:20
their arms were tied with rope but their legs were free and they could walk
52:27
the other sailors pushed the three prisoners up the beach laughing and shouting and hitting them
52:36
then some of them sat down on the sand and began to drink
52:42
others walked away to look at the island and two men stayed to watch the boat
52:50
the three prisoners walked slowly along the beach and sat down under a tree not far from
52:57
us they looked very unhappy
53:03
very quietly i came up behind them through the trees
53:08
and called out to them in english don't be afraid i said
53:15
i'm an englishman perhaps i can help you
53:21
the three men turned and looked at me they did not answer at once they were
53:27
too surprised perhaps they thought i was a wild man
53:32
myself in my strange homemade clothes of animal skins
53:38
and with my long hair and beard then the oldest man spoke
53:46
i am the captain of that ship he said and these two men are my first and
53:52
second officers last night there was a mutiny and the
53:57
seamen took the ship from me now they're going to leave the three of us here to die on this island
54:06
do these mutineers have guns only two he answered and they've left those
54:13
on the boat all right i said we'll fight them
54:19
but if we get your ship back for you you must take me back to england
54:26
the captain agreed immediately and thanked me very warmly for my help
54:33
friday ran back to my house to get all the guns and the captain and i made a plan
54:42
the first part was easy because the seamen were not ready for a fight
54:48
we shot the two men at the boat and the captain shot another man this man
54:55
tom smith was the worst of them all and he began the mutiny on the ship
55:02
then the captain talked to the other five men and they agreed to help him
55:08
they did not really want to be mutineers but they were afraid of tom smith
55:15
now i said to the captain we must get back your ship how many men are on it
55:22
26 the captain replied and they will fight hard because they
55:28
won't want to go home it is death for all mutineers in england
55:34
but not all the men are bad i'm sure that some of them will help me
55:40
just then we saw another boat which was coming from the ship to the shore
55:46
there were ten men in it and they all had guns we ran into the trees and waited
55:55
it was a long hard fight but by now it was dark and this helped us very much we ran
56:03
here and there in the trees calling and shouting the seamen could not see us and did not
56:10
know how many men they were fighting in the end the first officer shouted to
56:16
them put down your guns and stop fighting
56:22
the captain has 50 island people to help him we can kill you all
56:30
so the seamen stopped fighting and we took their guns
56:36
three of the men agreed to come back to the captain and we put the others in my cave
56:45
friday and i stayed to watch the prisoners while the captain and his men went back
56:51
to fight for the ship all night we listened to the sound of
56:58
guns and shouting but in the morning when the sun came up
57:03
the captain was master of his ship again i went down to the shore to meet him
57:12
my dear friend he cried there's your ship i'll take you to the
57:18
ends of the world in it i put my arms around him and we laughed
57:24
and cried together how happy i was to leave the island
57:31
my good friend friday came with me of course but we left the mutineers on the island
57:39
we decided not to kill them they could begin a new life on the island
57:46
i showed them my three houses my cornfields and my goats and all my tools
57:53
their life would be easy because of all my hard work for so many years
57:59
and so on the 19th of december 1686 after 27 years
58:07
2 months and 19 days i said goodbye to my island
58:14
and sailed home to england
58:22
[Music]
58:28
chapter nine home in england
58:34
when i came back to england i felt like a stranger in the country
58:41
many things were different and not many people remembered me
58:47
i went home to york but my father and mother were dead and also my two brothers
58:55
i did find the two sons of one of my brothers they were happy to learn that i was
59:02
alive and i was pleased to find some family
59:08
after some months i decided to go down to lisbon in portugal
59:14
i had friends there who could help me to sell my land in brazil and i needed the money friday came with
59:22
me he was always a good and true friend to me
59:29
in lisbon i found the portuguese captain who took me in his ship to brazil all
59:35
those years ago it was good to see him again and he
59:41
helped me with my business soon i was ready to go home again
59:47
by land no more adventures and dangers by sea for me it was a long
59:55
hard journey we had to cross the mountains between spain
1:00:00
and france in winter and the snow was deep
1:00:05
poor friday was very afraid of the snow in his country it was always hot
1:00:12
and he did not like cold weather back in england i found a house
1:00:19
and began to live a quiet life my two nephews came to live with me
1:00:27
the younger one wanted to be a sailor and so i found him a place on a ship
1:00:34
after a while i married and had three children two sons and a daughter
1:00:42
then my wife died and my nephew who was now the captain of a ship came
1:00:49
home to see me he knew that i did not really like a quiet life
1:00:56
i have a fine ship uncle he said i'm going out to the east indies india
1:01:03
malaya the philippines why don't you come with me
1:01:09
and so in 1694 i went to see again and had many more
1:01:16
adventures perhaps one day i'll write another book
1:01:22
about them
