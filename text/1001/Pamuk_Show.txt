When _Ka, poet, returns to Turkey after years of political exile in Germany, he is sent as a journalist to the remote city of _Kars on the Turkish border. He is a reporter on the local election, which is likely to be won by fundamental Islamists, and to investigate a sudden outbreak of suicides among young women fighting for the right to wear their Islamic head scarves. As a blizzard cuts the city off from the outside world, tensions between secularists and fundamentalists come to a head in a violent coup. _Ka enters the city with the mindset of one who has been brought up in a secular, Westernized Turkish family, and has lived for many years in the West. He is ready to listen to everyone, but is dismissive of fundamentalism, seeing such beliefs as backward. But, drawn into the events around, _Ka will leave the city, once the blizzard is over, an utterly changed man, with his heart broken.
This is tense political thriller, cut through with moments of black farce. The reader is bombarded with different views, as _Ka meets fundamentalists, secularists, writers, religious leaders, and the "head scarf girl" themselves. The book considers not only the clash between Turkey's various political and cultural groups, but also contemplates the basic gap between East and West, the nature of religious belief, and how art is created.
Turkish author _Orhan _Pamuk, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Literature, has described Snow as "my first and last political novel". First published in Turkey in 2002, Snow caused controversy among _Pamuk's compatriots, with some critics viewing him as being too Westernized to paint a fair portrait of however, for his honest portrayal of Turkey's complex political and cultural situation.
