-----------------------------------------
Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject only to acceleration as a result of gravity. The applications of projectile motion in physics and engineering are numerous. Some examples include meteors as they enter Earth’s atmosphere, fireworks, and the motion of any ball in sports. Such objects are called projectiles and their path is called a trajectory. The motion of falling objects as discussed in Motion Along a Straight Line is a simple one-dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement. In this section, we consider two-dimensional projectile motion, and our treatment neglects the effects of air resistance.

The most important fact to remember here is that motions along perpendicular axes are independent and thus can be analyzed separately. We discussed this fact in Displacement and Velocity Vectors, where we saw that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. The key to analyzing two-dimensional projectile motion is to break it into two motions: one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical. (This choice of axes is the most sensible because acceleration resulting from gravity is vertical; thus, there is no acceleration along the horizontal axis when air resistance is negligible.) As is customary, we call the horizontal axis the x-axis and the vertical axis the y-axis. It is not required that we use this choice of axes; it is simply convenient in the case of gravitational acceleration. In other cases we may choose a different set of axes. Figure 4.11 illustrates the notation for displacement, where we define 𝐬⃗  to be the total displacement, and 𝐱⃗  and 𝐲⃗  are its component vectors along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The magnitudes of these vectors are s, x, and y.

Figure 4.11 The total displacement s of a soccer ball at a point along its path. The vector 𝐬⃗  has components 𝐱⃗  and 𝐲⃗  along the horizontal and vertical axes. Its magnitude is s and it makes an angle Φ with the horizontal.

To describe projectile motion completely, we must include velocity and acceleration, as well as displacement. We must find their components along the x - and y - axes. Let’s assume all forces except gravity (such as air resistance and friction, for example) are negligible. Defining the positive direction to be upward, the components of acceleration are then very simple:

𝑎𝑦 = −𝑔 =−9.8m/s2(−32ft/s2).

Because gravity is vertical, 𝑎𝑥=0. If 𝑎𝑥=0, this means the initial velocity in the x direction is equal to the final velocity in the x direction, or 𝑣𝑥=𝑣0𝑥. With these conditions on acceleration and velocity, we can write the kinematic Equation 4.11 through Equation 4.18 for motion in a uniform gravitational field, including the rest of the kinematic equations for a constant acceleration from Motion with Constant Acceleration. The kinematic equations for motion in a uniform gravitational field become kinematic equations with 𝑎𝑦=−𝑔,𝑎𝑥=0:

Horizontal Motion

𝑣0𝑥=𝑣𝑥,𝑥=𝑥0+𝑣𝑥𝑡
4.19

Vertical Motion

𝑦=𝑦0+12(𝑣0𝑦+𝑣𝑦)𝑡
4.20
𝑣𝑦=𝑣0𝑦−𝑔𝑡
4.21
𝑦=𝑦0+𝑣0𝑦𝑡−12𝑔𝑡2
4.22
𝑣2𝑦=𝑣20𝑦−2𝑔(𝑦−𝑦0)

Using this set of equations, we can analyze projectile motion, keeping in mind some important points.

PROBLEM - SOLVING STRATEGY

Projectile Motion
Resolve the motion into horizontal and vertical components along the x - and y - axes. The magnitudes of the components of displacement 𝐬⃗  along these axes are x and y. The magnitudes of the components of velocity 𝐯⃗  are 𝑣𝑥=𝑣cos𝜃and𝑣𝑦=𝑣sin𝜃, where v is the magnitude of the velocity and θ is its direction relative to the horizontal, as shown in Figure 4.12.
Treat the motion as two independent one-dimensional motions: one horizontal and the other vertical. Use the kinematic equations for horizontal and vertical motion presented earlier.
Solve for the unknowns in the two separate motions: one horizontal and one vertical. Note that the only common variable between the motions is time t. The problem - solving procedures here are the same as those for one-dimensional kinematics and are illustrated in the following solved examples.
Recombine quantities in the horizontal and vertical directions to find the total displacement 𝐬⃗  and velocity 𝐯⃗ . Solve for the magnitude and direction of the displacement and velocity using
𝑠=𝑥2+𝑦2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√,𝛷=tan−1(𝑦/𝑥),𝑣=𝑣2𝑥+𝑣2𝑦‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√,

where Φ is the direction of the displacement 𝐬⃗ .

Figure 4.12 (a) We analyze two-dimensional projectile motion by breaking it into two independent one-dimensional motions along the vertical and horizontal axes. (b) The horizontal motion is simple, because 𝑎𝑥=0 and 𝑣𝑥 is a constant. (c) The velocity in the vertical direction begins to decrease as the object rises. At its highest point, the vertical velocity is zero. As the object falls toward Earth again, the vertical velocity increases again in magnitude but points in the opposite direction to the initial vertical velocity. (d) The x and y motions are recombined to give the total velocity at any given point on the trajectory.

A Fireworks Projectile Explodes High and Away

During a fireworks display, a shell is shot into the air with an initial speed of 70.0 m/s at an angle of  75.0°  above the horizontal, as illustrated in Figure 4.13. The fuse is timed to ignite the shell just as it reaches its highest point above the ground. (a) Calculate the height at which the shell explodes. (b) How much time passes between the launch of the shell and the explosion? (c) What is the horizontal displacement of the shell when it explodes? (d) What is the total displacement from the point of launch to the highest point?

Figure 4.13 The trajectory of a fireworks shell. The fuse is set to explode the shell at the highest point in its trajectory, which is found to be at a height of 233 m and 125 m away horizontally.

Strategy
The motion can be broken into horizontal and vertical motions in which  𝑎𝑥=0  and  𝑎𝑦=−𝑔.  We can then define  𝑥0  and  𝑦0  to be zero and solve for the desired quantities.

Solution
(a) By “height” we mean the altitude or vertical position y above the starting point. The highest point in any trajectory, called the apex, is reached when  𝑣𝑦=0.  Since we know the initial and final velocities, as well as the initial position, we use the following equation to find y:
𝑣2𝑦=𝑣20𝑦−2𝑔(𝑦−𝑦0).
 
Because  𝑦0  and  𝑣𝑦  are both zero, the equation simplifies to

0=𝑣20𝑦−2𝑔𝑦.
 
Solving for y gives

𝑦=𝑣20𝑦2𝑔.
 
Now we must find  𝑣0𝑦,  the component of the initial velocity in the y direction. It is given by  𝑣0𝑦=𝑣0sin𝜃0,  where  𝑣0  is the initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and  𝜃0=75°  is the initial angle. Thus,

𝑣0𝑦=𝑣0sin𝜃=(70.0m/s)sin75°=67.6m/s
 
and y is

𝑦=(67.6m/s)22(9.80m/s2).
 
Thus, we have

𝑦=233m.
 
Note that because up is positive, the initial vertical velocity is positive, as is the maximum height, but the acceleration resulting from gravity is negative. Note also that the maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity, so that any projectile with a 67.6-m/s initial vertical component of velocity reaches a maximum height of 233 m (neglecting air resistance). The numbers in this example are reasonable for large fireworks displays, the shells of which do reach such heights before exploding. In practice, air resistance is not completely negligible, so the initial velocity would have to be somewhat larger than that given to reach the same height.

(b) As in many physics problems, there is more than one way to solve for the time the projectile reaches its highest point. In this case, the easiest method is to use  𝑣𝑦=𝑣0𝑦−𝑔𝑡.  Because  𝑣𝑦=0  at the apex, this equation reduces to simply

0=𝑣0𝑦−𝑔𝑡
 
or

𝑡=𝑣0𝑦𝑔=67.6m/s9.80m/s2=6.90s.
 
This time is also reasonable for large fireworks. If you are able to see the launch of fireworks, notice that several seconds pass before the shell explodes. Another way of finding the time is by using 𝑦=𝑦0+12(𝑣0𝑦+𝑣𝑦)𝑡.  This is left for you as an exercise to complete.

(c) Because air resistance is negligible,  𝑎𝑥=0  and the horizontal velocity is constant, as discussed earlier. The horizontal displacement is the horizontal velocity multiplied by time as given by  𝑥=𝑥0+𝑣𝑥𝑡,  where  𝑥0  is equal to zero. Thus,

𝑥=𝑣𝑥𝑡,
 
where  𝑣𝑥  is the x - component of the velocity, which is given by

𝑣𝑥=𝑣0cos𝜃=(70.0m/s)cos75°=18.1m/s.
 
Time t for both motions is the same, so x is

𝑥=(18.1m/s)6.90s=125m.
 
Horizontal motion is a constant velocity in the absence of air resistance. The horizontal displacement found here could be useful in keeping the fireworks fragments from falling on spectators. When the shell explodes, air resistance has a major effect, and many fragments land directly below.

(d) The horizontal and vertical components of the displacement were just calculated, so all that is needed here is to find the magnitude and direction of the displacement at the highest point:

𝐬⃗ =125𝐢ˆ+233𝐣ˆ
 
∣∣𝐬⃗ ∣∣=1252+2332‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√=264m
 
𝛷=tan−1(233125)=61.8°.
 
Note that the angle for the displacement vector is less than the initial angle of launch. To see why this is, review Figure 4.11, which shows the curvature of the trajectory toward the ground level.

When solving Example 4.7(a), the expression we found for y is valid for any projectile motion when air resistance is negligible. Call the maximum height y = h. Then,

ℎ=𝑣20𝑦2𝑔.
 
This equation defines the maximum height of a projectile above its launch position and it depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity.


Time of Flight, Trajectory, and Range
-------------------------------------
Of interest are the time of flight, trajectory, and range for a projectile launched on a flat horizontal surface and impacting on the same surface. In this case, kinematic equations give useful expressions for these quantities, which are derived in the following sections.

Time of flight
We can solve for the time of flight of a projectile that is both launched and impacts on a flat horizontal surface by performing some manipulations of the kinematic equations. We note the position and displacement in y must be zero at launch and at impact on an even surface. Thus, we set the displacement in y equal to zero and find

𝑦−𝑦0=𝑣0𝑦𝑡−12𝑔𝑡2=(𝑣0sin𝜃0)𝑡−12𝑔𝑡2=0.
Factoring, we have

𝑡(𝑣0sin𝜃0−𝑔𝑡2)=0.
Solving for t gives us

𝑇tof=2(𝑣0sin𝜃0)𝑔.
 
4.24
This is the time of flight for a projectile both launched and impacting on a flat horizontal surface. Equation 4.24 does not apply when the projectile lands at a different elevation than it was launched, as we saw in Example 4.8 of the tennis player hitting the ball into the stands. The other solution, t = 0, corresponds to the time at launch. The time of flight is linearly proportional to the initial velocity in the y direction and inversely proportional to g. Thus, on the Moon, where gravity is one-sixth that of Earth, a projectile launched with the same velocity as on Earth would be airborne six times as long.

Trajectory
The trajectory of a projectile can be found by eliminating the time variable t from the kinematic equations for arbitrary t and solving for y(x). We take  𝑥0=𝑦0=0  so the projectile is launched from the origin. The kinematic equation for x gives

𝑥=𝑣0𝑥𝑡⇒𝑡=𝑥𝑣0𝑥=𝑥𝑣0cos𝜃0.
 
Substituting the expression for t into the equation for the position  𝑦=(𝑣0sin𝜃0)𝑡−12𝑔𝑡2  gives

𝑦=(𝑣0sin𝜃0)(𝑥𝑣0cos𝜃0)−12𝑔(𝑥𝑣0cos𝜃0)2.
 
Rearranging terms, we have

𝑦=(tan𝜃0)𝑥−[𝑔2(𝑣0cos𝜃0)2]𝑥2.
 
4.25
This trajectory equation is of the form  𝑦=𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑥2,  which is an equation of a parabola with coefficients

𝑎=tan𝜃0,𝑏=−𝑔2(𝑣0cos𝜃0)2.
 
Range
From the trajectory equation we can also find the range, or the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile. Factoring Equation 4.25, we have

𝑦=𝑥[tan𝜃0−𝑔2(𝑣0cos𝜃0)2𝑥].
 
The position y is zero for both the launch point and the impact point, since we are again considering only a flat horizontal surface. Setting y = 0 in this equation gives solutions x = 0, corresponding to the launch point, and

𝑥=2𝑣20sin𝜃0cos𝜃0𝑔,
 
corresponding to the impact point. Using the trigonometric identity  2sin𝜃cos𝜃=sin2𝜃  and setting x = R for range, we find

𝑅=𝑣20sin2𝜃0𝑔.
 
4.26
Note particularly that Equation 4.26 is valid only for launch and impact on a horizontal surface. We see the range is directly proportional to the square of the initial speed  𝑣0  and  sin2𝜃0 , and it is inversely proportional to the acceleration of gravity. Thus, on the Moon, the range would be six times greater than on Earth for the same initial velocity. Furthermore, we see from the factor  sin2𝜃0  that the range is maximum at  45°.  These results are shown in Figure 4.15. In (a) we see that the greater the initial velocity, the greater the range. In (b), we see that the range is maximum at  45°.  This is true only for conditions neglecting air resistance. If air resistance is considered, the maximum angle is somewhat smaller. It is interesting that the same range is found for two initial launch angles that sum to  90°.  The projectile launched with the smaller angle has a lower apex than the higher angle, but they both have the same range.

Figure a shows the trajectories of projectiles launched at the same initial 45 degree angle above the horizontal and different initial velocities. The trajectories are shown from launch to landing back at the initial elevation. In orange is the trajectory for 30 meters per second, giving a range R (distance from launch to landing) of 91.8 m. In purple is the trajectory for 40 meters per second, giving a range R of 163 m. In blue is the trajectory for 50 meters per second, giving a range R of 255 m. The maximum height of the projectile increases with initial speed. Figure b shows the trajectories of projectiles launched at the same initial speed of 50 meters per second and different launch angles. The trajectories are shown from launch to landing back at the initial elevation. In orange is the trajectory for an angle of 15 degrees above the horizontal, giving a range R of 128 m. In purple is the trajectory for an angle of 45 degrees above the horizontal, giving a range R of 255 m. In blue is the trajectory for an angle of 75 degrees above the horizontal, giving a range R of 128 m, the same as for the 15 degree trajectory. The maximum height increases with launch angle.
Figure 4.15 Trajectories of projectiles on level ground. (a) The greater the initial speed  𝑣0,  the greater the range for a given initial angle. (b) The effect of initial angle  𝜃0  on the range of a projectile with a given initial speed. Note that the range is the same for initial angles of  15°  and  75°,  although the maximum heights of those paths are different.
EXAMPLE 4.9
Comparing Golf Shots
A golfer finds himself in two different situations on different holes. On the second hole he is 120 m from the green and wants to hit the ball 90 m and let it run onto the green. He angles the shot low to the ground at  30°  to the horizontal to let the ball roll after impact. On the fourth hole he is 90 m from the green and wants to let the ball drop with a minimum amount of rolling after impact. Here, he angles the shot at  70°  to the horizontal to minimize rolling after impact. Both shots are hit and impacted on a level surface.
(a) What is the initial speed of the ball at the second hole?

(b) What is the initial speed of the ball at the fourth hole?

(c) Write the trajectory equation for both cases.

(d) Graph the trajectories.

Strategy
We see that the range equation has the initial speed and angle, so we can solve for the initial speed for both (a) and (b). When we have the initial speed, we can use this value to write the trajectory equation.
Solution
(a)  𝑅=𝑣20sin2𝜃0𝑔⇒𝑣0=𝑅𝑔sin2𝜃0‾‾‾‾‾√=90.0m(9.8m/s2)sin(2(30°))‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√=31.9m/s 
(b)  𝑅=𝑣20sin2𝜃0𝑔⇒𝑣0=𝑅𝑔sin2𝜃0‾‾‾‾‾√=90.0m(9.8m/s2)sin(2(70°))‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√=37.0m/s 

(c)
𝑦=𝑥[tan𝜃0−𝑔2(𝑣0cos𝜃0)2𝑥]Second hole:𝑦=𝑥[tan30°−9.8m/s22[(31.9m/s)(cos30°)]2𝑥]=0.58𝑥−0.0064𝑥2Fourth hole:𝑦=𝑥[tan70°−9.8m/s22[(37.0m/s)(cos70°)]2𝑥]=2.75𝑥−0.0306𝑥2 

(d) Using a graphing utility, we can compare the two trajectories, which are shown in Figure 4.16.

Two parabolic functions are shown. The range for both trajectories is 90 meters. One shot travels much higher than the other. The higher shot has an initial velocity of 37 meters per second and an angle of 70 degrees. The lower shot has an initial velocity of 31.9 meters per second and an angle of 30 degrees.
Figure 4.16 Two trajectories of a golf ball with a range of 90 m. The impact points of both are at the same level as the launch point.
Significance
The initial speed for the shot at  70°  is greater than the initial speed of the shot at  30°.  Note from Figure 4.16 that two projectiles launched at the same speed but at different angles have the same range if the launch angles add to  90°.  The launch angles in this example add to give a number greater than  90°.  Thus, the shot at  70°  has to have a greater launch speed to reach 90 m, otherwise it would land at a shorter distance.
CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 4.4
If the two golf shots in Example 4.9 were launched at the same speed, which shot would have the greatest range?
When we speak of the range of a projectile on level ground, we assume R is very small compared with the circumference of Earth. If, however, the range is large, Earth curves away below the projectile and the acceleration resulting from gravity changes direction along the path. The range is larger than predicted by the range equation given earlier because the projectile has farther to fall than it would on level ground, as shown in Figure 4.17, which is based on a drawing in Newton’s Principia. If the initial speed is great enough, the projectile goes into orbit. Earth’s surface drops 5 m every 8000 m. In 1 s an object falls 5 m without air resistance. Thus, if an object is given a horizontal velocity of 8000 m/s (or 18,000 mi/hr) near Earth’s surface, it will go into orbit around the planet because the surface continuously falls away from the object. This is roughly the speed of the Space Shuttle in a low Earth orbit when it was operational, or any satellite in a low Earth orbit. These and other aspects of orbital motion, such as Earth’s rotation, are covered in greater depth in Gravitation.

The figure shows a drawing of the earth with a tall tower at the north pole and a horizontal arrow labeled v 0 pointing to the right. 5 trajectories that start at the top of the tower are shown. The first reaches the earth near the tower. The second reaches the earth farther from the tower, and the third even farther. The fourth trajectory hits the earth at the equator, and is tangent to the surface at the equator. The fifth trajectory is a circle concentric with the earth.
Figure 4.17 Projectile to satellite. In each case shown here, a projectile is launched from a very high tower to avoid air resistance. With increasing initial speed, the range increases and becomes longer than it would be on level ground because Earth curves away beneath its path. With a speed of 8000 m/s, orbit is achieved.
