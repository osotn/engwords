Matt Ridley
The Red Queen. Sex and the evolution of human nature.

Chapter
Human nature
------------
When a surgeon cuts into a body, he knows what he will find inside.
But the differences are tiny compared with the similarities.

It is the assumption of this book that there is also, in the same way, a typical
nature. 
The "smile" of a baboon is a threat; the smile of a man is a sign of pleasure.
But there are culture codes: a shake of the head that means yes.

Is that it is impossible to understand human nature without understanding how
it evolved, and it is impossible to understand how it evolved without understanding
how human sexuality evolved.

Why sex? Reproduction is the sole goal for which human beings are designed;
everything else is a means to that end: human beings inherit tendencies to survive,
to eat, to think, to speak, and so on. But above all they inherit a tendency to
reproduce. Therefore, anything that increased the chances of a person reproducing
successfully was passed on at the expense of anything else.
There is no other way for evolution to work except by competitive reproduction.
The ability to reproduce is what makes living things different from rocks.

! Everything can be inherited except sterility !
None of your direct ancestors died childless.

Reproduction is not synonymous with sex; there are many asexual ways to reproduce.
