Chapter 1
Human nature
------------
When a surgeon cuts into a body, he knows what he will find inside.
But the differences are tiny compared with the similarities.

It is the assumption of this book that there is also, in the same way, a typical
nature. 
The "smile" of a baboon is a threat; the smile of a man is a sign of pleasure.
But there are culture codes: a shake of the head that means yes.

Is that it is impossible to understand human nature without understanding how
it evolved, and it is impossible to understand how it evolved without understanding
how human sexuality evolved.

Why sex? Reproduction is the sole goal for which human beings are designed;
everything else is a means to that end: human beings inherit tendencies to survive,
to eat, to think, to speak, and so on. But above all they inherit a tendency to
reproduce. Therefore, anything that increased the chances of a person reproducing
successfully was passed on at the expense of anything else.
There is no other way for evolution to work except by competitive reproduction.
The ability to reproduce is what makes living things different from rocks.

! Everything can be inherited except sterility !
None of your direct ancestors died childless.

Reproduction is not synonymous with sex; there are many asexual ways to reproduce.

Of Nature and nurture
----------------------
The idea that we were designed by our past was the principal insight of Charles Darwin.
Every living species is designed quite unconsciously by the selective reproduction
of its own ancestors to suit a particular life style.
Human nature was as carefully designed by natural selection for the use of a social,
bipedal, originally African ape as human stomachs were designed for the use of
an omnivorous African ape with a taste for meat.

!!!
Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature,
and both are the products of evolution.
!!!

Bodies are built from cake like recipes, not architectural blueprints, and it is
simply impossible to feed information back into the recipe by changing the cake.

Sex cells - eggs and sperm = remained segregated from the rest of the body from
the moment of their birth. Germ remains unchanged during the development of the
ovum into an organism. You are born free of sin.

Universal human nature, common to all peoples.
Shakespeare was writing about the same human nature that we know today.
Only his vocabulary (which is nurture, not nature) has aged.

The individual in society
-------------------------
Human beings are individuals. All individuals are slightly different.
Societies that treat their constituent members as identical pawns soon run into
trouble. Economists and sociologists who believe that individuals will usually act
in their collective rather than their particular interests (from each according to
his ability, to each according to his needs   vs  devil take the hindmost) are
soon confounded: society is composed of competing individuals as surely as markets
are composed of competing merchants; the focus of economic and social theory is,
and must be, the individual.

Just as genes are the only things that replicate, so individuals, not societies,
are the vehicles for genes.

Every idiot can be father or mother to a genius - and vice versa.
Every face and every set of fingerprints is effectively unique.

Sex mixes together the genes of two people and discards half of the mixture,
thereby ensuring that no child is exactly like either of its parents.
And it is also sex that causes all genes to be contributed eventually to the pool
of the whole species by such mixing.
Sex causes the differences between individuals but ensures that those difference
never diverge far from a golden mean for the whole species.

A simple calculation will clarify the point: every human being has two parents,
four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, sixteen gret-gret-grandparents, and so on.

A mere thirty generations back - in, roughly, A.D. 1066 - you had more than a billion
direct ancestors in the same generation = 2^30.

If you go back further still, the different human races soon merge. Little more than
three thousand generations back, all of our ancestors lived in Africa.
Yet the differences between any two individuals, of the same race or of different
races, can still be large. BUT only 7 % of the genetic differences between two
individuals can be attributed to the fact that they are of different race; 85 % of
genetic differences are attributable to mere individual variation, and the rest
is tribal or national.

Sex is merely the dealer, generating unique hands from the same monotonous deck
of genetic cards shared by the whole species.

Uniqueness of the individual is only the first of the implication s of sex for
human nature: male and female.

Different natures for the two genders, natures that suit the particular role of each gender.
Male usually compete for access to females, rather than vice versa.
Men are more aggressive than women.

A third implication of sex for human natures is that every other human being alive
today is potential source of genes for your children. And we are descended from only
those people who sought the best genes, a habit we inherited from them.
People are attracted to people of high reproductive and genetic potential:
    - the healthy;
    - the fit;
    - powerful.

Ours to reason why?
--------------------
Adaptation

There was no designer.

Animal (simple) is an automation, carrying out the simple instructions of her neural program.
If whitefly occupied, withhold sperm.

I believe that it is always worth asking the question  WHY?
Most of science is the dry business of discovering how the universe works, how
the sun shines, or how plants grow. Most scientists live their lives steep -ed
in HOW questions, not WHY questions.
Difference between the question:
    - Why do men fall in love?
    - How do men fall in love?
The answer to the second will surely turn out to be merely a matter of plumbing.
Men fall in love through the effects of hormones on brain cells and vice versa,
or some such physiological effect. One day some scientist will know exactly how
the brain of a young man becomes obsessed with the image of a particular young
woman, molecule by molecule. But the why question is to me more interesting
because the answer gets to the heart of how human nature came to be what it is.

In mobile animals hermaphrodites are less good at doing two things at once than
males and females are at each doing his or her own thing.


In physics, there is no great difference between a why question and a how question.
How does the earth go around the sun? - by gravitational attraction.
Why does the earth go around the sun? - because of gravity.

Every living creature is a product of its past.

Of conflict and cooperation
---------------------------

Computers have no effect on productivity because people learn to complicate and
repeat tasks that have been made easier.

Every creature on earth is in a Red Queen chess tournament with its:
    - parasites (or hosts);
    - predators (or prey);
    - mate.

Cooperation and conflict.

The enigma

Pregnant virgins
----------------
For people, sex is only why to have babies, and that, plainly enough, is its purpose.
The problem was that there seemed to be all sorts of better ways of reproducing.
Microscopic animals split in two.

Of sex and free trade
---------------------
A brief genetic glossary is necessary before we proceed.
Genes are biochemical recipes written in a four letter alphabet called DNA,
recipes for how to make and run a body.
A normal human being has two copies of each of 30,000 genes in every cell in his or
her body. The total complement of 60,000 human genes is called the genome, and
the genes live on twenty three pairs of ribbon like
