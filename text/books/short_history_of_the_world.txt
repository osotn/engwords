The Roman World
---------------

Macedon and Hellenism
---------------------
A new Mediterranean and Near Eastern world was in large measure defined by Greeks.
Paradoxically, this came about during the decay of the city states.
Some people - Macedonians, for the most part - claimed it to be a Greek state and
part of the Greek world. The Macedonians spoke Greek and attended
 Hellenic festivals; their kings claimed to be descended from Greek families -
 from Achilles, the great Achaenan hero of the Iliad, no less.
 But many Greeks thought the Macedonians were a barbarous lot, barely civilized,
 and certainly not on a par with the cultivated peoples of the Aegean and Sicilian
 cities.
 
 Macedon changed the course of Greek history. Appearance in 359 BC of an able and
 ambitious prince - ambitious, among other things, that Macedon should be recognized
 as Greek - Philip II.
 Macedon was rich in gold and so could pay for a strong and effective army.
 
 p.125
 Alexander the Great
 -------------------
 The Macedonian army was so good, indeed, that under Philip and his son it ended
 the independence of the mainland Greek cities and an era of human history, the
 age of the polis. 335 BC. The Great age of classical Greece was over.
 He crossed Asia to attack the Persians at the head of an army drawn from many
 Greek states, to 323 BC, when he died in Babylon only thirty-three years old.
 He had been tutored by Aristotle.
 
358-336 BC      -   Reign of Philip II of Macedon
338     BC      -   Philip control of mainland Greece
336-323 BC      -   Reign of Alexander.
336     BC      -   Alexander invade s Persian empire
332     BC      -   Capture of Egypt

He across Iran and Afghanistan, the Oxus and beyond to Samarkand, and invade India.

Alexander founded many cities and mixed Greeks and Asians in his army so that they
learnt from one another and it became a more cosmopolitan force.
The empire itself did not hold together for long; Alexander left no heir.

p.127
Alexander's successors: the Hellenistic world
---------------------------------------------
The richest of these kingdoms was in Egypt, where a Macedonian general named Ptolemy
seized control. Ptolemy founded the last Egyptian dynasty of antiquity. It was
to rule Egypt until 30 BC (when the last of the Ptolemies, the famous Cleopatra, died).

Indian family of Seleucus (another Macedonian general).

Greek became the official language of the whole Near East and more widely used as
an everyday language too, above all in its new cities.

Egyptian Alexandria was especially preeminent in science. Euclid, the man who systematized geometry
and gave it a shape which lasted until the nineteenth century, lived there.

p.128
The rise of Roman Power
-----------------------
Empire of Rome. Begins long before Alexander, after the expulsion of the Etruscan kings, around 510 BC.
Rome was then a republic. Spread of Roman power. In republican times it came to encompass the whole
Mediterranean world.

The early republic
------------------
Roman Senate and People. Noble families = patricians.

For a long time the typical Roman citizen was a peasant farming his own small
property. He was independent.
Second century BC did big estates owned by town men and relying on slave labour
to grow cash crops of grain or olives (for oil) become at all common.

In 390 BC Gauls from north sacked Rome itself.

Roman: stragetic position, military system.
Every male citizen who owned property had to serve in the army if needed.

Even while taking over Italy, Rome had became involved farther a field.
Some of the Greek cities had called in the king of Epirus to help them
against the Romans in the early third century BC.

The Punic Wars
--------------
Carthage = Phoenician was a great naval, with outpost s in Sicily and Sardinia.

Punic = comes from the Latin word for Phoenician.

The 1st war in 241 BC - Sicily (the first Roman overseas territories).

The 2nd war in 218 BC. Before the Carthaginians had established themselves in Spain,
settling at New Carthage (Cartagena).
- all Sicily was now Roman and southern Spain, too, was conquered.
Soon slaves and gold from Sicily, Sardinia and Spain were making some Romans aware
the conquest s might be profitable.

The decay of the Republic
-------------------------
The first citizens were all men and nearly always peasants. They had the right to
vote and get justice before the courts, and the duty of serving in the army.
Then rights of citizenship were gradually given to many people outside the original
Roman territories. Secondly, the Punic wars impoverished the Italian peasant.

Slaves were sometimes used to work them. 
The citizen peasant tended to drift to the city to find a living there as best
he could. Called a proletarian - someone whose only contribution to the state
was to breed children.

The army became more and more a full time professional force, rather than one
of citizens armed and brigaded for emergencies. Legions was organized became
permanent organizations, whose soldiers increasingly felt loyalty to their comrades
and their generals.

Pac romana
-----------
Common law.
In 50s BC a young politician called Julius Caesar - France, Spain, Portugal.

Rome became a dangerous place - to political intrigue and corruption were now
added murder and mob violence. People began to fear the emergence of a dictator,
but were not sure where he was to come from.

Caesar conquered Gaul. His seven years their gave him three great advantages; he
was away from Rome while other people were blamed for the increasing disorder,
violence and corruption; he became enormously rich.

The end of the Republic
-----------------------
In January 49 BC Caesar struck. Claiming to be defending the Republic from its
enemies, he crossed the river Rubicon, the border of his province, and marched on
Rome with his army - an illegal act. For four years he campaigned in Africa, Spain,
and Egypt, chasing his opponents who had armies in the provinces which they
might use against him. He carefully organized his political support in the Senate
and was made dictator for life. But some Romans feared that Caesar might re establish
a monarchy. In the end his enemies came together and in 44 BC he was murdered.

In the end his great nephew and adopted hier, Octavian, made it clear that there
had been an irreversible change and so began what we know as the Roman empire.
Octavian first hunted down the politicians who had murdered Caesar.
 = Augustus.
 
Tiberius, ...

Christianity
------------
Jesus (Nazareth in Palestine ~ 6 BC) hEad big impact on history.
Christians is the followers of Jesus, Palestinian Jews.
History of Jews - after the Babylonians carried off so many of them to Exile in 587 BC,
and destroyed the Temple at Jerusalem, Jews had come to feel even more distinctive
adn even more unlike other Near Eastern peoples.
Synagogue - place of teaching and reading.

p.136
The Jews in the Roman empire
----------------------------
The end of Seleucid rule in 143 BC was followed by a period of independence for
about eighty years and then Judaea was taken by Rome. By the time of Augustus,
fewer Jews lived in Judaea than in the rest of the Roman empire.

p.137
Jesus of Nazareth
-----------------
In AD 26 a new Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, was appointed at a bad monent in
its history to the province of which Judaea was a part.
The Jews of Syria and Palestine hated one another, hated their Greek and Syrian
neighbours, and hated most of all the Roman occupiers and their tax gatherers.
Zealots - nationalist movement.
Many Jews were waiting for a leader, a Messiah, one anointed by God.
So Jesus was crucified, probably in AD 33.

p.138
-----
St Paul
-------
The new Jewish sect took root first in Jewish communities.
Paul, a greek speaker and an educated man, nevertheless put his view of Jesus
message into Greek and in ideas of Greek philosophy.
Greek ideas of the distinction between soul and body, of the links between the
visible, material world and the invisible, spiritual world were used by
him to preach his message.

p.139
The Roman Empire
----------------
Imperator, the title borne by Augustus and his successors, took a long time to
come to mean the man at the top of the empire, what we call an emperor.
In the century after Augustus death there were twelve emperors, of whom the first
four were related to him or his family, the last of them, Nero, dying in AD 68.
Real power lay with the army.
Young Gauls, Syrians, Afticans and Illyrians all learnt Latin and Greek, wore
clothes like those of the Romans and learnt to think of Romanitas.


p.454
Towards a second world war
--------------------------

Hitler's lasting achievements were all to prove to be destructive.
He led Germany on a course which in the end not only shattered the national
unity won by Bismarck, but also handed over nearly all eastern Europe to the
Russians, whom he despised, under Bolsheviks whom he hated.
In the process, millions of people were killed in another world war, in whose
slaughter the Germans were not spared. Yet his foreign policy had at first brought
enormous successes.
