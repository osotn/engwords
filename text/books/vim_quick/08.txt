Chapter 8

Undo and Redo
Vim has a very powerful undo feature. When you press u in Normal mode, or run :u in Command
mode, you’ll call the Undo command. To undo all recent changes on the current line, press U .
When you press Ctrl -r in Normal mode or run :red[o] , you’ll run the redo command.
If you want to undo multiple times, just press u the desired number of times. For example,
command uuu will undo the last three changes. To undo multiple changes you can also use
command u with a digit prefix, for example: 5u —which will undo the last five changes.
That’s not all—it gets even better. In Vim, you can travel through time! Using command
ea[rlier] you can go back in time, while using command lat[er] you can travel forward. These
two commands work on a state basis. This means that, if you make 4 changes, and run earlier 2 ,
last two changes would be reverted. Similarly, if you run command later 1 , Vim will redo one
last change.
