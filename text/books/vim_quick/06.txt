Personalizing Vim
If you’ve had any experience with some of the text editors for programmers, it’s most likely
you’ll be disappointed with how Vim looks. But this is actually a good thing. While other editors
try to force you use their features, Vim does the opposite.
The “interface” is very minimal. This means that you have to spend some time and effort to
make the Vim interface look pretty, as well as to improve your productivity. 
The benefit is this process of configuration will help you understand better how Vim works.
