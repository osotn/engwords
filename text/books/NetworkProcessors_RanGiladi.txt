Introduction and Motivation
---------------------------
Network processors (NPs) are chips - programmable devices that can process network
packets (up to hundreds of millions of them per second), at wire - speeds of
multi Gbps.
Their ability to perform complex and flexible processing on each packet, as well
as the fact that they can be programmed and reprogrammed as required, make them
a perfect and easy solution for network systems vendors developing packet processing
equipment.

Telecommunications and data networks have become essential to everything that
we do, to our well-being and to all of our requirements:
 - mobile;
 - video
 - Internet
 - TV
 - automation
 - multimedia
 - entertainment
 - online services
 - shopping
 - games

There are traditionally two communication systems we use:
 - telecommunications (telecom)
 - data communication (datacom)

Telecommunication network is based on circuits or channels of continuous bit streams,
which grew out of its original applications to telephony services.
The more recent networks, the data communications networks, were initially based on
packets of data to carry information among computers.

This resulted in two paradigms of network technologies:
    - circuit switching;
    - packet switching.

The main technologies in the datacom systems are Ethernet and Internet Protocol (IP).


Network elements are usually architected in two separated planes:
    - the control plane: routing and management protocol (RIP, OSPF, BGP, RSVP, LDP).
    - data forwarding plane - packet processing, address searches, forwarding, classifying, metering, NAT

Typical system:
 - pizza box;
 - multicard chassis

Forwarding plane is responsible for per-packet processing and handling, it is
executed by high-speed devices such as ASICs or NPs.

Control plane processing is usually executed by general-purpose processors, since
the load on the control plane is significantly less than that of the data forwarding plane.


Network processors are categorized into three groups according to their use and
the way they have evolved: 
 - entry level or access NPs;
 - mid-level processors (legacy and multiservice NPs);
 - high-end NPs that targeted for core and metro networking equipment

Entery level NPs (or access NPs) process streams of up 1 to 2 Gbps packets,
and are sometimes used for enterprise equipment:
 - telephony systems (voice)
 - xDSL
 - cable modems

Mid-level NPs (2-5 Gbps) contain two subgroups: legacy NPs and multiservice NPs:
sevice cards of communication equipment, data center equipment. 

High-End (10-100Gbps) are used mainly for core and metro networks.

Network processors are sometimes distinguished from packet processors by being
programmable, whereas packet processors are just configurable.

Network processors perform several key functions, including:
 - parsing the incoming frames in order to understand what they are, and where
 to find the relevant information that is required for processing.
 - retrieving the relevant information from the frames, which may be complicated
 as encapsulation, variable fields length, and various levels of protocols.
 - deep packet analysis when reqired.
 - searching for related information in repositories: routing tables, access lists.
 - classifying the frames
 - modifying the frame's
 - forwarding

 Networking Fundamentals
 -----------------------
Network can be found in many places and in many shapes, on many kinds of media
and serving many purposes.
We focus on a small but important segment of networks, where network processors
are used in network nodes to carry the networking functions.

Ethernet and IP networks.
Ethernet technology is used primarily and traditionally for data communication in
local area networks (LANs), and more recently in metropolitan area networks
(MANs), or Metro networks.
IP which is a network of networks, is used as the underlying technology for
the Internet and most wide area networks (WANs).

2.1 Introduction
----------------
In recent years, telecommunications, computers, networks, contents, and
applications concepts have been combined and reshaped into new paradigms of
infrastructure (networks and equipment), services (applications) and information
(content).
