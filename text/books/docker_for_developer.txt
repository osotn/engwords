Preface
-------
Software engineering teams are rapidly adopting containers to package and deploy
their software. Providing a platform - agnostic experience, containers allow you
to run applications with a variety of operation system images and to deploy
on-premises, in data centers, and in the cloud. In order to support container based
applications, vendors have developed a wide variety of tools, ranging from
Docker and Google's Kubernetes project to Lyft's Envoy service mesh and Netflix's
Spinnaker.

Chapter 1.
Introduction to Docker
----------------------
Docker is a technology that allows entire applications and their environments
to be encapsulated within individual containers.
When multiple versions of these containers are run on single machine, they
are sandboxed from one another as if running on their own dedicated machines.

Docker is open source, which fits well with running Linux in containers, as well
as numerous available open source components that help build complex systems.
