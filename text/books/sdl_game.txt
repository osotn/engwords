SDL Game Development

Discover how to leverage the power of SDL 2.0 to create awesome games in C++

Chapter 1
Getting Started with SDL
------------------------

SDL = Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform multimedia library created by
Sam Oscar Latinga. It provides low-level access to input (via mouse, keyboard, and
gamepads / joysticks), 3D hardware, and the 2D video frame buffer.
SDL is written in the C programming language, yet has native support for C++.
The library also has binding for several other languages such as Pascal, Object-C,
Python, Ruby.


Chapter 2
Drawing in SDL
--------------

Graphics are very important to games and they can also be one of the main
performance bottlenecks if not handled correctly. With SDL 2.0 we can really
take advantage of the GPU when rendering, which gives up a real boost in terms
of the speed rendering.

We can also pass null into the render copy for either rectangle.
SDL_RenderCopy(m_pRenderer, m_pTexture, 0, 0);
Passing null into the source rectangle parameter will make the renderer
use the entire texture. Likewise, passing null to the destination rectangle
parameter will use the entire renderer for display.

Animating a sprite sheet
-------------------------
A sprite sheet is a series of animation frames all put together into one image.
The separate frames need to have a very specific width and height so that they
create a seamless motion.
