Introduction and overview
The Cambridge World History is authoritative and comprehensive, but not exhaustive.

Part I
Historiography, method, and themes

2. Writing world history
------------------------
The term world history describes one the oldest, most persistent and most pliable
forms of history writing.
Thus all histories are world histories.

Capture the idea of the past as being the source of rules or mores that not only
explain the present, but also help people living in the present to create a better
future.
Indigenous universal histories are painted, sung, danced and traced
across landscapes.

Herodotus (c. 484-420 BCE) is the father of Western history. Also he is credited
for having recognised that history can be a means for understanding world.

PART II
The paleolithic and the beginnings of human history
---------------------------------------------------

13.
Before the farmers: culture and climate, from the emergence of Homo sapiens
to about ten thousand years ago.

We are creatures of cold. From "Ice Age" about a hundred thousand years ago.
By the time global warming resumed, Homo sapiens had transformed from a small
group in East Africa to a globally dispersed, relatively numerous species,
living by comparison with fellow primates in large communities, typically
hundreds strong and sometimes larger.
Human culture - relative flexibility in adapting to a variety of environments
and relative mutability.
Imagination - in evolutionary jargon, - an unpredictable and
unnecessary consequence of evolutionary change.
Ice period from 150,000-200,000 to 12,000-13,000 years ago.

The archaeological record has not so far yielded evidence or rapid cultural
divergence among human groups for the first hundred thousand years or so of
the existence of Homo Sapiens.

The power of imagination, according to my assumptions, freed human cultures to
respond with extraordinary

Human dispersal
---------------
Our species emerged about 154,000 - 160,000 years ago.

Nature and scope of the migrations
----------------------------------
Why the moved, and what made them so adaptable to different environments.
Most species stay in the environments where they are best adapted.
Even human populations rarely, if ever, seek new environments willingly, or
adjust easily. Some of these new habitats bred unfamiliar diseases.
Extremely cold climates, deserts and seas.
In Middle East by about 100,000 years ago.
In China is about 67,000.
