Introduction and overview
The Cambridge World History is authoritative and comprehensive, but not exhaustive.

Part I
Historiography, method, and themes

2. Writing world history
------------------------
The term world history describes one the oldest, most persistent and most pliable
forms of history writing.
Thus all histories are world histories.

Capture the idea of the past as being the source of rules or mores that not only
explain the present, but also help people living in the present to create a better
future.
Indigenous universal histories are painted, sung, danced and traced
across landscapes.

Herodotus (c. 484-420 BCE) is the father of Western history. Also he is credited
for having recognised that history can be a means for understanding world.

PART II
The paleolithic and the beginnings of human history
---------------------------------------------------

Before the farmers: culture and climate, from the emergence of Homo sapiens
to about ten thousand years ago.

We are creatures of cold. From "Ice Age" about a hundred thousand years ago.
By the time global warming resumed, Homo sapiens had transformed from a small
group in East Africa to a globally dispersed, relatively numerous species,
living by comparison with fellow primates in large communities, typically
hundreds strong and sometimes larger.
Human culture - relative flexibility in adapting to a variety of environments
and relative mutability.
Imagination - in evolutionary jargon, - an unpredictable and
unnecessary consequence of evolutionary change.
Ice period from 150,000-200,000 to 12,000-13,000 years ago.

The archaeological record has not so far yielded evidence or rapid cultural
divergence among human groups for the first hundred thousand years or so of
the existence of Homo Sapiens.

The power of imagination, according to my assumptions, freed human cultures to
respond with extraordinary

Human dispersal
---------------
Our species emerged about 154,000 - 160,000 years ago.

Nature and scope of the migrations
----------------------------------
Why the moved, and what made them so adaptable to different environments.
Most species stay in the environments where they are best adapted.
Even human populations rarely, if ever, seek new environments willingly, or
adjust easily. Some of these new habitats bred unfamiliar diseases.
Extremely cold climates, deserts and seas.
In Middle East by about 100,000 years ago.
In China is about 67,000.
The first colonizers of Australia arrived over 50,000 years ago and must have
used boats, because at that time, water already separated what are now Australia
and New Guinea from Asia.
Homo sapiens reached Europe only a little later. Northern Asia - isolated by
daunting screen of cold climate - was probably colonized about 30,000 years ago.
A race if hunters crossed the land link between Asia and North America, where
the Bering Strait now flows, to enter a paradise where no human hunter had ever
trod before. We have evidence of early human settlement scattered from the Yukon
to Uruguay and from near the Bering Strait to the edge of the Beagle Channel.
Some came by sea and continued to come after the land bridge was submerged.

Causes of migrations
--------------------
Among the four horsemen: war, plague, famine, and natural disaster - war is the
odd one out. The other three tend to inhibit human action, whereas war spurs us
to new responses. One of the most fascinating problems of history is how and
when war started. According to one school of thought, war is natural to humankind.
Romantics defended the opposite point of view: that human nature is essentially
peaceful until competition corrupts it.
Whatever migrants motives, they needed sufficient technology to multiply and move.
Cooking with fire probably helped to make population growth possible, because
it made food easier to digest. Creatures like us, who have short guts, blunt teeth,
and only one stomach each, can only chew and digest limited energy sources.
But domestication of fire still seems to have occurred too early to help explain
the migrations.

p.324
Consequences
------------
If the causes of migration remain doubtful, some of its consequences are easier to
specify. Migration changed people's relationships with each other, the size and
organization of their groups, the way they saw the world, and the way they interacted
with other species.
In societies of increasing violence, men have enhanced roles, because, among all
primates, including humans, grater competitiveness in mating makes males, on average,
bigger and stronger than females. In consequence, alpha males rules, or at least
boss, most ape societies. Human males usually seem to bond more closely with each
other, of form more or stronger alliances, than females. This, too, is useful in
competitive circumstances, such as those of war and politics. Women, moreover, are
more easily mistaken as sacred because of the obvious correspondences between the
cycles of their bodies and the rhythms of the heavens.

14. Early humans: tools, language, and culture
----------------------------------------------
Before about 48,000 BCE human history was African history.
