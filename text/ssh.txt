SSH - Secure Shell

Is a protocol that allow two machines to communicate securely over a network.

Telnet - 1960s is not secure.
SSH    - 1995 with encryption.

To establish SSH Connection:
    -   Server (remote machine)
    -   Client (local  machine)
    -   authentication



Privacy is a basic human right.
Much of the data that travels on the Internet or local networks is
transmitted as plain text, and may be captured and viewed by anybody
with a little technical know how.

Network security is big business as companies scramble to protect their
information assets behind firewalls, establish virtual private networks (VPNs),
and encrypt files and transmissions.

SSH = Secure Shell

SSH is a low-cost, software based solution for keeping prying eyes eyes from
the data on a network.
It doesn't solve every privacy and security problem, but it eliminates
several of them effectively:
    -   A secure, client - server protocol for encrypting and transmitting
        data over a network;
    -   Authentication (recognition) of users by password, host, or
        public key, plus optional integration with other popular
        authentication systems, including Kerberos, SecurID, PGP, ...
    -   The ability to add security to insecure network application
        such as Telnet, FTP and many other
    -   Almost complete transparency to the end user
    -   Implementations for most operating systems

Introduction to SSH
===================

Data is sent by a computer to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it.
When the data reaches its intended recipient, SSH automatically
decrypts (unscrambles) it.
The result is transparent encryption.
Has a client/server architecture.

SSH is a secure form of UNIX r commands: rsh = remote shell.
ssh, scp, sloging

SSH is not a shell at all.

SSH is a protocol, not a product, it covers:
    -   authentication;
    -   encryption
    -   integrity of data transmitted over a network

SSH-1, SSH-2        - protocol (with dashes);
SSH1, SSH2          - product  (uppercase, without dashes)
ssh, ssh1, ssh2     - client program (lowercase)

SSH has various authentication mechanisms:
    -   keys;       <- is kept encrypted, secret passphrase
    -   passwords.

Public key files into your remote computer accounts.
ssh-agent program
ssh-add   program


Port forwarding:

IPSEC = Internet Protocol Security


----

1.6.6
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol => OpenSSL
is an authentication and encryption technique providing security services
to TCP clients by way of a Berkeley socket style API.
= new TLS  = Transport Layer Security.

CAs = certificate authorities serve.


1.6.9
-----
Firewall is a hardware device or software program that prevents certain
data from entering or exiting a network.

Basic Client Use
================

$ ssh -l user remote.com    <-  user@remote.com
user password: ******
Last login: ...
