Hi I am NAME. I am eleven years old. I live in London in a flat.
I have a cool flat. The door to my flat is green. Green is my favourite colour.

My school in London. My class is year 6. Mrs Brown is my class teacher.
She is great. My classroom is big. There are three big windows, ten desks,
a whiteboard, three posters and many books.

FRIEND and I sit at one desk. This desk is brown. My books and FRIEND books are
on the desk. ONE and TWO sit at one desk. THERE and FOUR sit at one desk too.
We are all friends. I like my class. I am happy here.
