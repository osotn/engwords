The field of electronics is one of the great success stories of the twentieth
century. From the crude spark gap transmitters and cat's whisker detectors at
its beginning, the first half century brought an era of vacuum tube electronics
that developed considerable sophistication and found ready application in area
such as communications, navigation, instrumentation, control, and computation.
The latter half century brought solid state electronics - first as discrete
transistors, then as magnificent arrays of them within ICs (integrated circuits)
 - in a flood of stunning advances that shows no sign of abating. Compact and
 inexpensive consumer products now routinely contain many millions of transistors
 in VLSI (very large scale integration) chips, combined with elegant optoelectornics
 (displays, lasers, and so on); they can process sounds, images, and data, and
 (for example) permit wireless networking and shirt pocket access to the pooled
 capabilities of the Internet. Perhaps as noteworthy is the pleasant trend toward
 increased performance per dollar. The cost of an electronic microcircuit routinely
 decreases to a fraction of its initial cost as the manufacturing process is
 perfected. In fact, it is often the case that the panel controls and cabinet
 hardware of an instrument cost more than the electronics inside.
 
 It is necessary to begin at the beginning - with talk of voltage, current, power,
 and the components that make up electronic circuits.
 
 Because you can't touch, see, smell, or hear electricity, there will be a certain
 amount of abstraction.
 
 There are two quantities that we like to keep track of in electronic circuits:
    -   voltage;
    -   current
These are usually changing with time; otherwise nothing interesting is happening.

Voltage (V/E). Officially, the voltage between two points is the cost in energy
(work done) required to move a unit of positive charge from the more negative
point (lower potential) to the more positive point (higher potential).
Equivalently, it is the energy released when a unit charge moves downhill
