Conclusion from assumption (premises)

    Symbol      Meaning
    ------      -------
          ∧                 and
          ∨                 or
       !           not

A set is a collection of objects. The objects in the collection are called the elements.

The relationship between set theory operations and logical connective s also
becomes apparent when analyze the logical forms of statements about:
    - intersections;
    - unions;
    - differences
of set.

If P then Q  - this statement is sometimes called a conditional statement, with
P as its antecedent and Q its consequent.
   P -> Q
   
P -> Q is supported to mean that if P is true then Q is also true:

    P Q   P -> Q
    ------------
    F F     T? = T
    F T     ?  = T
    T F     F
    T T     T

    If x > 2 then x^2 > 4
    x = 1   F F
    x = 3   T T
    x = -3  F T
      -     T F  - no value of x will lead to this case.
It's mean, then statement ' if x > 2 then x^2  > 4' was always true, no matter what x was!

Conditional law:
    P -> Q  = !P ∨ Q = !(P ∧ !Q)

    P -> Q and P then Q

          Premises      Conclusion
    P Q   P -> Q  P         Q
    ------------------------------
    F F     T     F         F
    F T     T     F         T
    T F     F     T         F
    T T     T     T         T


    P -> Q  and Q ->P  don't mean the same thing.
    Q -> P is called the converse of P -> Q

Contrapositive law:
    P -> Q is formula !Q -> !P, and it is equivalent P -> Q.

    iff = necessary and sufficient condition = biconditional statement

2.1 Quantifiers
2.2 Equivalences involving quantifiers
2.3 More operations on sets

---------------
2.1 Quantifiers


Statement P(x) containing a free variable x may be true for some values of x and
false for others.
How many values of x make P(x) come out true:
    -   for every value of x;
    -   at least one value of x.

Quantifiers:
    -   ∀x P(x) - for every value of x in the universe of discourse U, for all x, P(x)
      (upside down A = all)
             ∀ - universal quantifier
             ∀x P(x) says that P(x) is universally true.
    -   ∃x P(x) to say that there is at least one value of x in universe for which P(x) is true.
        There exists an x such that P(x)
       (The backward E = exists)
            ∃x is called existential quantifier.

    ∀x (x > 2 -> x^2 > 4).

    Statement ∀x∃y(x + y = 5) is true, but ∃y∀x(x + y = 5) is false !

--------------------------------------
2.2 Equivalences involving quantifiers

Quantifier Negation laws: 
    !∃x P(x) is equivalent to ∀x !P(x)
    !∀x P(x) is equivalent to ∃x !P(x)

      ∃x∃y <-> ∃y∃x  and  ∀x∀y <-> ∀y∀x

----------------------------------
2.3 More operations on sets

Elementhood test notation {x | P(x)}.

Anything at all can be an element of a set.
Possibility to have a other sets as elements.
F = {{1,2,3}, {4}, ∅} - families of set.
A = {1,2,3}
1 ∊ A but 1 ∉ F

Suppose A is set. The power set of A, denoted P(A), is the set whose elements
are all the subsets of A:       P(A) = {x | x ⊆ A}
