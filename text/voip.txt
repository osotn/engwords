VOIP is the name of a new communications technology that changes the meaning of the phrase
telephone call. Stands for voice over Internet Protocol, voice transmitted over a
computer network.

IPT = IP telephony - uses IP.
POTS = plain old telephone service, use circuit switched.
PSTN = public switched telephone network.

All IP phones have NIC (network Interface card).
MAC = media access control - address of NIC.

The first difference between the VOIP implementation of TCP/IP and the traditional
data implementation is in the application layer.
In VOIP call, the application layer utilizes the following three protocols:
	- NTP	Network time protocol
	- RTP	RT protocol. Provide end to end network transport functions.
	- RTCP  RT control protocol. Monitors voice signal delivery and provide control.

VOIP uses UDP.

VOIP refers to the process of transporting voice communications over Internet Protocol like the Internet.
IP Telephony is more general - transport of real time text over IP networks.

TTY - Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD).
TTY - keyboard, display + modem.

PSTN = public switched telephone networks. Use analog communication between our individual telephones
and the local switch.

All human speech sounds are formed by forcing air from the lungs through the vocal tract.
The vocal folds comprise two membranes located in the larynx.
These membranes allow the area of the trachea tp be varied.
When air passes through the vocal tract, it introduces short term variations
(1 ms in duration) into the speech signal.
The frequencies produced for formants are controlled by the varying shape
of the vocal tract and the movement of the tongue.

An important component found in many speech codecs is a short term filter that will attempt
to mimic the human.

During voiced speech, the vocal folds are normally closed.
Voiced sounds show a high degree of periodicity at the pitch period is typically 2..20 ms.
For normal speakers, this pitch can be anywhere in the range 50..400 Hz.

During unvoiced speech, the vocal folds are normally open so air can pass freely
into the rest of the vocal tract. The vocal folds do not vibrate in this process.

Plosive sounds result when a complete closure is made in the vocal tract and
air pressure that is built up behind this closure is released suddenly.

A speech signal is continuous in time.
It must be converted into a signal that is discrete in time.
Sampling is a process that converts a continuous time signal into a discrete time.
Quantization is defined as a process in which the continuous range of
values of an analog signal are sampled and divided into nonoverlapping
subranges.

Waveform coders / decoders (codecs) attempt to produce a reconstructed signal whose
waveform is a close as possible to the original without using any knowledge of how
the signal to be coded was generated.
Some codecs - 16kbps

PCM = pulse code modulation. Band limited 4..8 kHz, 12 bits per sample => 96kbps.

Hybrid coding
-------------
Waveform coders - down to about 16kbps
Vocoders can 2.4kbps, but cannot provide natural intelligible speed.
Abs (Analysis by synthesis) codecs.
MPE (multi pulse excited).
RPE (regular pulse excited).
CELP (code excited linear predictive).

AbS Coding
----------
AbS codecs splits the input speech to be coded into frames, typically about 20 ms long.
For each frame, parameters are determined for a synthesis filter, and then the excitation
to this filter is determined.
This is done by finding the excitation signal that, when passed into the given synthesis
filter, minimizes the error between the input speech and the reconstructed speech.
Thus the name analysis by synthesis: the encoder analyzes the input speech by
synthesizing many different approximations to it.
Finally, for each frame, the encoder transmits information representing the synthesis
filter parameters and the excitation to the decoder, and at the decoder, the
given excitation is passed through the synthesis filter to give the reconstucted signal.
Linear filter about 10 order.
The synthesis filter may also include a pitch filter to model the long term periodicities
present in voiced speech.

RCE (regular pulse excited) codec.
---
Like the MPE codec, RPE codec uses several nonzero pulses to give the excitation signal.

CELP (code excited liner predictive coding)
----
Combination of traditional Linear predictive (LP) modeling of the resonant qualities of the
vocal tract coupled with complex excitation modeling.

Human speech is effectively only half duplex.
Another property of a typical dialogue is the presence of intermittent silence - 50%

DSI (digital speech interpolation) - compression ration 4:1 by active and inactive channel.

3. Telephony
============
Human speech is best described as an acoustic, analog waveform signal.
In an analog telephone, speech is represented as an electric signal with frequency and amplitude.
Frequency - pitch of human speech.
Amplitude - volume of human speech.

The traditional telephone handset contains:
	- a receiver;		- earpiece 
	- a transmitter;	- mouthpiece
	- hybrid.

Four wires make up the handset.
The hydrid device makes this four-wire to two-wire conversion.

The switch hook is located directly below the handset.
When you lift the handset out of the cradle, the switch hook closes, and
an electrical current flows through the phone.
Phone is said to be off-hook - to operate the telephone device.

Side tone is essentially an intentional feedback signal that is an output of a phone's hybrid device.

Dialer is a device one uses to enter a phone number for the party to be called.
The phone number is, in essence, a digital address.
For a push-button phone, the caller would press buttons that each generate a unique tone pair
(dual-tone multi frequency).

VoIP is the term commonly used to refer to support of voice transmissions encapsulated and transmitted
within the IP packets of a network.

VoIP can offer users advantage as long distance toll bypass, interactive e-commerce, online support and much more.

IP is a connectionless packet-switching protocol.
IP is called a network layer.
TCP - reliable transport service on top the routing delivery service provided by IP.
TCP - sequential packet delivery and error recovery (duplicate).
UDP - IP+
RTP - real time protocol use UDP, end to end delivery of real time traffic such as interactive voice and video.
RTP include stamping, packet sequening, monitoried delivery of voice packet.

IP phone uses RJ-45
