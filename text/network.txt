Computer networks
=================

18th century:   industrial revolution
19th            Steam engine
20th            information gathering/processing/distribution => Internet

Computer networks = a collection of interconnected, autonomous computing devices.

Client-server model, where a client explicitly requests information from a server
that hosts that information.

Client machine    --- request -->    Server machine
 (process)        <-- response --      process


peer-to-peer model

Instant messaging

Electronic commerce:
B2C = business to consumer
B2B = business to business
G2C = government to consumer
P2P = peer to peer

Entertainment

Internet of Things (IoT)

802.11 hotspot

RFID = scan the barcodes

Smartphone => SMS (text messaging, texting).

GPS: geo-tagging

NFC = payment


1.2.3
Content Provider Networks
-------------------------
Many Internet services are now served from "the cloud", or data-center network.
Modern data center networks have hundreds of thousands of millions of servers in
a single location, usually in a very dense configuration of rows of racks in
buildings that can be more than a kilometer long.

1.2.4
Transit Network
---------------
ISP
backbone networks

1.2.5
Enterprise Networks
-------------------
VPN, email, VoIP

1.3 Network technology
----------------------
PAN (personal area networks) => Bluetooth
LAN (local area networks) => AP, wireless router, base station

wireless, copper, coaxial cable, optical fiber.
IEEE 802.11 - Wi-Fi
IEEE 802.3    Ethernet

Waves can travel through walls (2.4 GHz, less 5 GHz).

MAN (metropolitan LAN) covers a city.
IEEE 802.16 WiMAX
LTE (Long Term Evolution) and 5G

WAN (Wide LAN)

Internetworks
-------------
The device that makes a connection between two or more networks and provides the
necessary translation => gateway.



The ARPANET
-----------
The story begins in the late 1950s.
At the height of the Cold War, the U.S. DoD wanted a command-and-control network
that could survive a nuclear war.

Digital packet switching technology.

ARPA = Advanced Research Projects Agency.

TCP/IP, sockets Berkeley UNIX


Network protocol
================
Central concept in network protocol design is layering.

Reliability = the ability to recover from errors, faults or failures.
Resource allocation = sharing access to a common, limited resource.
Evolvability
