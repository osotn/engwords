Computer font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols.
There are three basic kinds:
 - bitmap fonts consist of a matrix of dots or pixels representing the image of each glyph in each face and size.
 - vector fonts (including, and sometimes standing as a synonym for outline fonts) use Bezier curves, drawing instructions and mathematical formulas to describe each glyph.
 - stroke fonts use a series of specified lines and addition information to define the profile.

Bitmap fonts are faster and easier to use in computer code, but non-scalable, requiring a separate font for each size. Outline and stroke fonts can be resized using a single font and substituting different measurements for components of each glyph, but need rendering the outline to a bitmap for display on screen or in print.

Fonts are designed and created using font editors.
Fonts can be monospaced (i.e. every character is plotted a constant distance from the previous character that it is next to, while drawing) or proportional (each character has its own width).

Bitmap stores as an array of pixels (bitmap). It is less commonly known as a raster font or a pixel font. Optimized size such as 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 points (assuming a resolution of 96 DPI)

DPI = dots per inch
Bitmap fonts are used in the Linux console.

Digital bitmap fonts (the final rendering of vector fonts) may use monochrome or shades of gray. The latter is anti-aliased. "Shades of gray" as intermediate between the color of the font and that of the background.
