1
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,815
Pretty windy out

2
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:07,880
That better not be the one
where you blow people up

3
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,855
It's not, Mom

4
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,870
Dad, look what I can do

5
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,900
I've been practicing

6
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,885
That's spectacular, kiddo

7
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,825
Cool

8
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,835
You're inside out

9
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,870
Oh... I knew that

10
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,890
Doesn't work for you?

11
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,850
Can't believe you taught him that

12
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,850
I didn't... He did it on his own

13
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,845
Charlie, did you brush your teeth?

14
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:48,835
- Yes
- Charlie...

15
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,860
I brushed them

16
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,860
Let me see

17
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,860
Look at this, Con...

18
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,845
Let's go. I'm serious

19
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:56,843
You're driving me bonkers, Mom...

20
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:58,863
Let's go

21
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:00,860
Con, remember when we
were gonna buy Omnidel

22
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:02,811
you said no?

23
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:03,878
You remember what
the price was?

24
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:06,825
1.50 $

25
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,848
Close. 61 $

26
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:09,852
I'll do it, Mom

27
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:11,811
No, I'm gonna do it

28
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:13,825
You know what it's
going for now, Con?

29
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:15,812
- Say, "e"
- Eeeee

30
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:16,892
Guess, Con

31
00:03:17,803 --> 00:03:19,822
Edward, I don't know, all right?

32
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:21,846
All right, now rinse

33
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:22,876
74 $

34
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:25,803
Really rinse. And pee

35
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:27,863
I should've bought it. Shit

36
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:30,827
So buy some

37
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:32,848
Too late, Con. Too late

38
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:34,858
Lift the seat, honey

39
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,895
Don't forget to put it down!

40
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,882
When you finish...

41
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,813
Do you really need all that stuff?

42
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:53,886
Mom... no one wears these dorky hats

43
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,810
Well, you do, and you're not a dork

44
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:57,863
How do I look?

45
00:03:57,874 --> 00:03:59,820
Very handsome

46
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,884
Love you... Ok. Come on, let's go!

47
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:07,801
Jesus!

48
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,848
Come on

49
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:11,868
Maybe you shouldn't go in today

50
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:13,831
I promised I'd do that
stuff for the auction...

51
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:15,848
And someone's got
a birthday coming up

52
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:17,896
Latrell Sprewell jersey, Mom

53
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:19,849
Don't forget

54
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,819
He's on the Yankees, right?

55
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,856
Mom...

56
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:25,829
You're driving me bonkers

57
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,856
You're driving him bonkers

58
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:33,844
Jesus...

59
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:35,850
it's a holiday there

60
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:36,874
Well, I'll just keep talking

61
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:39,814
No, no, that's ok.
But in order to pick up...

62
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:08,867
Taxi!

63
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:10,806
Shit!

64
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:13,817
Taxi!

65
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,898
Taxi. Taxi!

66
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,812
Oh... Shit!

67
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,897
I'm so sorry!

68
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:59,848
- Oh, putanne! Mes bouquins!
- I'm so sorry

69
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:01,846
Putanne! Mes bouquins!

70
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:03,899
I'm sorry

71
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,842
I'll get your things

72
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:13,851
Aw, shit!

73
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:19,850
Taxi! Taxi!

74
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:21,838
My books! Putanne!...

75
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:37,852
I need a taxi!
Could you help me get a taxi?

76
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:38,856
Ok

77
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:40,876
I'll watch your books

78
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,847
- Thanks
- Thank you

79
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,860
Hey. Hey!

80
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:51,877
Hey!

81
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,812
Bad day for taxis

82
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,823
It's this horrible wind

83
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:10,883
Yeah. You shot down
there like a bullet!

84
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:13,873
If you flapped your arms,
you'd be home by now

85
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:16,800
I'll remember that next time

86
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:19,860
That's not good

87
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:20,873
I know

88
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:24,877
Listen, that's me up there...
the flower pot

89
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:28,898
I get you a band-aid, ok?

90
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:35,819
Hold on to something.
Don't blow away

91
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:41,859
Or... you can come on
up and clean it off, no?

92
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,896
Come on!

93
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,860
I'm not an ax murderer. I promise

94
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:01,851
Oh, shit

95
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:04,829
Fucking elevator

96
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,839
Ne marche pas jamais cet ascenseur!

97
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,829
Ascenseur de merde!

98
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:12,842
Allez! One more!

99
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,818
Pardon the mess

100
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,808
You a writer?

101
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:41,832
I'm a book dealer

102
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,842
Bathroom's right
down there, on the left

103
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:51,886
Go ahead

104
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:53,877
There's a medicine cabinet

105
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:57,841
You can sneak a peak
at my prescriptions

106
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:06,851
Hello

107
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:19,802
I made you some tea

108
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:20,842
Thank you

109
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,846
Do you box?

110
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:26,877
I used to... when I was young

111
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,886
This is an amazing place

112
00:11:32,847 --> 00:11:34,817
Yeah, but it's not mine

113
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:35,834
No?

114
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:37,810
The owner is a friend, a sculptor

115
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:40,814
and he's living in Paris,
so... that's cool

116
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,858
We can stay here, me and my books

117
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,825
I... can I use your phone?

118
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:51,839
I have to call home

119
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:54,812
Oh, sure, sure. There's
a phone just behind you

120
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,866
Thank you

121
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:03,877
Gloria? Hi, it's me

122
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:05,834
Good, good

123
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:07,824
How's Charlie?

124
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:10,874
Hi, honey. How was
your day at school?

125
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:12,898
Yeah? What was the best part?

126
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:17,865
Guess what. Can you believe
that mommy missed her train?

127
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:26,820
Ice

128
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,893
About an hour

129
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:33,820
You should start your homework

130
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,887
No. I promise to tell you
all about it when I see you

131
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:38,871
I love you. Bye

132
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:42,804
That was my son Charlie

133
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,847
He's 8. He'll be 9 next week

134
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,888
I'm Paul Martel.
I'll be 28 in July

135
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,879
I'm Constance

136
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,842
And I'm late. I have to go

137
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:58,825
Before you go, take your book... no?

138
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:03,872
Oh, no, I... I couldn't. I don't...

139
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,843
Sure, you can

140
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:07,830
A souvenir

141
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,800
Go down there

142
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:11,804
You know, like before

143
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:12,878
Ok

144
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:22,851
Keep going...

145
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,861
Stop!

146
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:26,849
Now right

147
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,859
No. Right

148
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:34,842
Ok, now... the second
shelf from the top...

149
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:37,820
Take the fourth one
from the left

150
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:38,890
Got it?

151
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,831
Think so

152
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,867
Open to page 23

153
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,874
"Drink wine"

154
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,898
This is life eternal

155
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:57,889
"This, all that youth"

156
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,868
will give to you

157
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,887
"It is the season for wine"

158
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:04,836
roses, and drunken friends

159
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:06,897
"Be happy for this moment

160
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:08,809
This moment..."

161
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,880
is your life"

162
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:20,867
I have to go

163
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,814
Thank you

164
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:24,865
Can you find your way out?

165
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:25,892
I hope so

166
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,845
That's my bedroom

167
00:14:33,843 --> 00:14:36,863
It was nice meeting you, Constance

168
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:41,813
Hey, come back if you need more
books or... medical attention

169
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,810
A perfect 10 there!

170
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,897
Oh, my! Did you see that?

171
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:21,857
Hey, Glo, hey

172
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:25,838
That wouldn't be
the TV on, would it?

173
00:15:25,878 --> 00:15:27,871
I was just turning it off

174
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,838
Sure you were

175
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:37,856
The wind knocked me down today, Glo

176
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:41,869
Oh, yeah? You all right?
Do you need anything?

177
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,857
Gross!

178
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:48,843
- Were you in a fight?
- No, just fell over

179
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:49,863
Does it hurt?

180
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:50,877
A little bit

181
00:15:50,878 --> 00:15:52,826
Cool!

182
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:53,857
Where are you going?

183
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:55,831
To get the camera!

184
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:57,861
- Try this
- Thank you

185
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,801
What do you need a camera for?

186
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,888
It's for school.
We're doing blood and stuff

187
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:07,835
Ok, now look like it really hurts

188
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:08,899
- Ready?
- Yep

189
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:13,882
This'll be great

190
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:15,872
The wind blew her down...

191
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:18,799
She bled and everything

192
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,899
Everybody's hats blew off

193
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,873
Look who's the worid photographer

194
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:22,827
You ok?

195
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:24,893
Yeah... It took me
down like an old lady

196
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:27,804
- Honey...
- It's humiliating

197
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,854
Dad, look at the pictures

198
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,861
At least we got the evidence.
Anyone we can sue?

199
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:34,878
No

200
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,875
There was this nice
guy who helped me

201
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:40,842
It was like this, Dad. It was a twister

202
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:44,879
Dad, look!

203
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,853
It was like this. This is a tornado

204
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:53,853
He lived around there. He got me
some Band-Aids and put me in a taxi

205
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:56,850
Is he good-looking?

206
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:01,844
I feel sick

207
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,857
Did you do your homework, Charlie?

208
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:06,821
I can't. I don't know how to do it

209
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:08,831
Well, come on. I'll help you

210
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:10,808
You can help me with mine

211
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,882
Did you get his name? This guy?

212
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,849
You can send him a bottle a wine

213
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,832
Cheap wine

214
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:37,885
Con, stand there a second.
Con, wait a minute...

215
00:17:39,802 --> 00:17:41,868
Just stay there a second. I'm just
trying to figure out how to do the...

216
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:45,882
The thing I can't
figure out is the...

217
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:47,845
zoom thing here

218
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,880
There it is. Ok, hold on. Stay there

219
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,873
The zooming thingie... zooming in

220
00:17:56,897 --> 00:17:59,800
Stay there. No, come on. I'm just
trying to figure this thing out

221
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:00,887
I want to see if it focuses...

222
00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:03,877
Hold on. Come here

223
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:08,804
Cool. Very cool

224
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,808
So beautiful

225
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:13,802
If you only knew... Look at you

226
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:15,818
God, what a beauty

227
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,830
Something the matter?

228
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:30,866
Nothing

229
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:32,877
Nothing at all

230
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:34,833
Good

231
00:18:34,884 --> 00:18:36,834
Come here

232
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,892
- This is really good
- No, it isn't. Go away

233
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:54,886
- Come here
- This is major

234
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:01,836
I think it really is zooming in

235
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:02,876
I found the zoom

236
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:04,820
Found it

237
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:06,857
Dad!

238
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:08,832
Mom!

239
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,801
Shit! Ok...

240
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:12,874
I can't sleep!

241
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,857
- That camera...
- Jesus!

242
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:20,842
I'll be back. I'll be back...
Don't fall asleep

243
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:23,802
It works!

244
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:30,850
Mom, are you nuts?

245
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:32,874
You forgot my lunch

246
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:33,893
I did not

247
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:36,856
It's by the door. Come with me

248
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:38,897
What are you chew...
what are you chewing?

249
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:39,884
Nothing

250
00:19:40,818 --> 00:19:41,868
Spit that out. What is that?

251
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,891
That's lovely

252
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:48,829
- Mom?
- Yes?

253
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:50,869
I don't want to be a dumb bunny

254
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:52,852
Honey, it's a play

255
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,829
There's lots of other bunnies

256
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,825
It would be cool to be a bunny

257
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:59,816
- You're bonkers, Mom
- That's what you tell me

258
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,803
- Love you
- Love you, too. What's that?

259
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:03,897
Oh. Thank you

260
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:09,846
Bye

261
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:23,885
Shit

262
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,803
Hi, this is Paul Martel

263
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:19,817
Leave a message after
the beep. Thanks.

264
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:23,828
Hello? Hello?

265
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:24,827
Hello?

266
00:22:24,828 --> 00:22:25,861
- Hello
- Hello!

267
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:27,834
You're... you're there

268
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:29,882
This is Connie Sumner

269
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:32,821
The one from the really windy day

270
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:33,888
Oh, that one!

271
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,859
How's the knee? Did you ice it?

272
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:40,869
Yes, I iced it and
I elevated it and...

273
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,850
you name it, I did it,
and it's much better and I...

274
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:47,837
And I... I just wanted to call and
I wanted to thank you and...

275
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,823
I wanted to ask for your address

276
00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:50,861
because I wanted to
send you a bottle of...

277
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,863
- Where are you?
- What?

278
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,831
I said where are you?

279
00:22:57,892 --> 00:22:59,808
I'm in Grand Central

280
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:01,861
It's really hard to hear you

281
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:03,809
Come and see me

282
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:04,825
What?

283
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:06,805
Yeah, take a break

284
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:08,839
I'll make you some coffee

285
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:12,849
Coffee...

286
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,810
Ok

287
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:21,870
Ok

288
00:23:22,821 --> 00:23:23,867
See you. Bye

289
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:25,820
Fuck

290
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:39,822
No permanent damage, I see

291
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:45,826
We take Medicaid, Blue Cross...

292
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:47,886
I'm uninsured

293
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:51,824
No, I'm afraid we don't
take charity cases here

294
00:23:56,881 --> 00:23:58,817
It was a joke

295
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:08,865
Oh, look at this...

296
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,832
Jack London

297
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:12,838
First edition of "White Fang"

298
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:15,815
In the original dust jacket.
And you know what?

299
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:17,819
I got it for a buck and 50

300
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,826
What's it worth?

301
00:24:19,897 --> 00:24:22,817
About 4,000 times more!

302
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:27,830
Those are in French

303
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:29,894
I took it in school

304
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:34,811
"Tu veux enlever ton manteau?"

305
00:24:35,852 --> 00:24:37,898
Do I want to take off something?

306
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:41,852
Your coat

307
00:24:42,802 --> 00:24:44,846
Would you like to
take off your coat?

308
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,866
Yes, my coat...

309
00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:48,882
Thank you

310
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:00,874
But I can't stay very long.
I have some errands I have to run

311
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:04,885
- I'll get the coffee
- Ok

312
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:13,838
Shit

313
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:28,840
It's in Braille

314
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:30,837
Braille

315
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:33,843
No, no. Braille. He was French

316
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:36,864
Close your eyes

317
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:38,821
What?

318
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,825
Close your eyes

319
00:25:54,883 --> 00:25:58,810
"My mother makes me chicken"

320
00:26:00,897 --> 00:26:04,866
"Her chicken makes me cough"

321
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:09,804
"I wish that when she made it"

322
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:12,851
"she took the feathers off"

323
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,845
It doesn't say that

324
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:31,853
I had better go

325
00:26:31,854 --> 00:26:34,843
I got to go

326
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:41,848
Take care. Don't fall

327
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:43,861
Thanks for the coffee

328
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:46,831
You didn't drink it

329
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:01,806
Hi

330
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:04,827
Lindsay, hi

331
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:06,817
Connie...

332
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:08,857
- Let me buzz him
- Thanks

333
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:13,887
Hey, what a surprise

334
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:15,824
Look at you!

335
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,804
- Hi, Bill
- Hi, Connie

336
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:18,805
Am I interrupting?

337
00:27:18,815 --> 00:27:19,878
- No, no
- I was just leaving

338
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:22,842
All right, I'll... I'll get you
the budget for those trucks later

339
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:23,865
All right. Thanks

340
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:24,895
Would you like a coffee?

341
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:27,829
No, thank you

342
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,862
That's nice

343
00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:38,877
You know, I didn't know
you were coming in today

344
00:27:38,878 --> 00:27:40,833
I could've given you a ride

345
00:27:40,844 --> 00:27:42,877
You're freezing. What is that?

346
00:27:42,888 --> 00:27:46,841
Well, I was around the corner,
and I brought you a present

347
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:49,807
What's the occasiَn?

348
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,885
Nothing. I don't know

349
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,882
It's a medium, but
they said it runs large

350
00:27:56,856 --> 00:27:58,812
Look at that!

351
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,802
You don't have to try it on

352
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,885
I'm the boss. I can do
whatever I want

353
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:12,863
What do you think?

354
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:16,830
Hold on just a second

355
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:19,847
Yeah?

356
00:28:20,838 --> 00:28:23,895
Oh, all right, but
hold the other calls

357
00:28:24,882 --> 00:28:26,842
You're busy. I'll go

358
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:29,815
- I'll go
- No. Sit. Sit. Sit

359
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:30,852
Hello, Henry...

360
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:33,823
Yeah, so what is this
suspensiَn problem?

361
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:35,863
No, I never received it

362
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:39,873
Well, all right.
Well, get it to me

363
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:42,890
Henry, this... No,
it's not good enough

364
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:45,833
I'm sitting here with 200
trucks that I can't use

365
00:28:45,884 --> 00:28:47,803
All right. Well, set up a meeting

366
00:28:47,804 --> 00:28:49,861
Yeah, and I want
Frank Burnbaum there

367
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:51,865
'Cause I don't feel
good about this guy

368
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:54,835
When I tell someone to do
something, I want it done

369
00:28:54,882 --> 00:28:56,864
I'm sure you will

370
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:00,899
Anyway...

371
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:04,848
So, what else you up to?

372
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,849
- Auction
- Yeah?

373
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,882
Who'd you hit on?

374
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:14,813
The usual suspects...

375
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:17,847
Who?

376
00:29:19,854 --> 00:29:22,874
- Bob Gaylord
- Bob?

377
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:27,858
You get a pledge out of Bob, they
should send you to the middle east

378
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:35,892
So, tell me...

379
00:29:37,883 --> 00:29:39,813
What?

380
00:29:41,803 --> 00:29:42,886
What do you think?

381
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,870
It's a keeper!

382
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,897
Jeez

383
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,810
Hello

384
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,870
Hello

385
00:30:57,804 --> 00:30:58,898
Here I am again

386
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:01,818
I brought muffins

387
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:04,808
"Tu veux enlever ton manteau?"

388
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:17,899
What is this music?

389
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,867
You like it?

390
00:31:20,807 --> 00:31:21,817
Yes

391
00:31:23,837 --> 00:31:24,893
Do you want to dance?

392
00:31:26,827 --> 00:31:27,851
Now?

393
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:29,813
Yeah

394
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:31,898
Ok

395
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:37,864
I have to warn you,
I tend to lead

396
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:40,808
Of course. You are American

397
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,846
You've done this before

398
00:31:53,857 --> 00:31:55,823
What?

399
00:31:57,877 --> 00:32:00,880
How many girlfriends
have you had?

400
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:06,817
Two

401
00:32:06,878 --> 00:32:08,881
Really?

402
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:11,871
Would I lie to you?

403
00:32:12,802 --> 00:32:13,882
I don't know, would you?

404
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:35,804
Your eyes are amazing,
you know that?

405
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:37,881
You should never shut them.
Not even at night

406
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:41,818
You should learn to sleep
with your eyes open

407
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:46,802
I'll work on that

408
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,842
Will you?

409
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:53,839
Hang on

410
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:00,810
I think this is a mistake

411
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:04,888
There's no such thing as a mistake

412
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:07,870
There's what you do
and what you don't do

413
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:11,805
I can't do this

414
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:25,896
I forgot my coat

415
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:43,847
I can't. I can't

416
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:45,857
What? What's wrong?

417
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:47,861
I can't. I don't know
how to do this

418
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:49,884
- This is wrong
- Hit me

419
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:51,821
I don't want to

420
00:35:51,832 --> 00:35:52,884
Hit me

421
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,845
Hit me

422
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:36,831
Say, Ed!

423
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:38,865
- Hey, Bob!
- Haven't seen you in a while

424
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:41,829
No. No. I've been
working late this week

425
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,843
How's the boy?

426
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:45,868
He's a pistol of a kid.
He's gonna have a birthday

427
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:46,873
- Really? How old?
- 9

428
00:37:47,814 --> 00:37:50,807
So any major armed robberies?

429
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:52,820
No. No, not this week

430
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:53,893
Speaking of armed robberies...

431
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:55,844
you better watch out for Connie

432
00:37:55,845 --> 00:37:57,854
She's gonna get you to
sign over your mortgage

433
00:37:57,865 --> 00:37:59,827
What do you mean?

434
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:02,814
Did she try to hit
on you for some money?

435
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:03,615
No

436
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:05,828
I thought she talked
to you about this...

437
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:07,878
School auction... or whatever

438
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:09,809
Not me

439
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,869
But I've been out of town. Maybe
she talked to Maggie about it

440
00:38:13,883 --> 00:38:16,816
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I got it wrong

441
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,853
Anyway, we owe you a dinner

442
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:21,863
Yeah

443
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:32,855
He's out

444
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:37,818
Can I get you anything?

445
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,825
No. No, I'm fine. Thanks

446
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:45,839
Tough day?

447
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,873
Not really

448
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:51,839
How about you?
How was your day?

449
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:54,827
It was good

450
00:38:54,837 --> 00:38:56,883
You know, the usual stuff

451
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:05,868
Sure you don't want anything?

452
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:07,885
No

453
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:10,829
Con?

454
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:11,885
Yeah?

455
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,883
Do you love me?

456
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,893
Of course I love you

457
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:21,842
What a silly question

458
00:39:22,873 --> 00:39:27,803
I guess... I'm just feeling silly

459
00:39:32,814 --> 00:39:34,814
I'll be up in a minute

460
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:35,864
Ok

461
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:38,828
Sorry

462
00:41:43,828 --> 00:41:44,881
What are we doing here?

463
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:48,825
Having lunch

464
00:41:50,862 --> 00:41:52,864
I shouldn't be doing this

465
00:41:52,865 --> 00:41:55,802
What, you shouldn't be having lunch?

466
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:56,892
Not with you

467
00:41:57,863 --> 00:41:59,846
I think we should leave

468
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:06,870
Listen...

469
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,810
see those guys over
there paying the check?

470
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:14,811
- Yes
- Ok

471
00:42:14,814 --> 00:42:17,847
If the guy on the right pays,
we'll leave right now

472
00:42:17,848 --> 00:42:21,825
If the guy on the left pays, we stay

473
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:26,808
And... I kiss you

474
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:28,868
No. No

475
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,839
No. No. No

476
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,826
Hey, you're kidding me, man

477
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:41,873
I win

478
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:46,857
No

479
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:48,810
- C'est la vie!
- No

480
00:42:48,811 --> 00:42:51,855
Don't do it. Don't

481
00:44:06,803 --> 00:44:07,803
Room for two?

482
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:08,855
Of course

483
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,843
Nice music

484
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:49,800
What is it?

485
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:52,857
It's...

486
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:55,837
African, I think

487
00:44:56,828 --> 00:44:57,877
I like it

488
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,846
Here

489
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:01,888
Let's go to bed. Come on

490
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:03,885
Stay here with me

491
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:04,875
I'm cold

492
00:46:04,876 --> 00:46:06,841
- Stay here
- I'm cold

493
00:46:11,806 --> 00:46:12,828
Stay here with me

494
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:13,829
I'm cold

495
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,842
Come on, let's go

496
00:46:43,826 --> 00:46:44,889
How about lunch today?

497
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:46,879
You free?

498
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:51,879
I have all this fund-raiser
stuff Auction things to pick up

499
00:46:51,883 --> 00:46:53,852
We can do an early one, if you want

500
00:46:53,863 --> 00:46:55,823
How about 12:00?

501
00:46:55,834 --> 00:46:57,803
12:00?

502
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:58,840
Yeah

503
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:04,854
Will I be hungry at 12:00?

504
00:47:12,845 --> 00:47:14,825
We could go in together

505
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,825
I'll wait for you

506
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,828
I'm not gonna be ready
to go for at least an hour

507
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:22,826
That's all right. I'll wait

508
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:38,824
- Oh, shit
- What?

509
00:47:38,825 --> 00:47:40,808
I just remembered...

510
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:44,894
I have a facial at 12:30
at Georgiana's today

511
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:47,875
Oh, well...

512
00:47:49,816 --> 00:47:51,885
You gotta stay beautiful, right?

513
00:47:55,893 --> 00:47:58,829
Georgiana's?

514
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:02,899
Waste of money

515
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,821
Yeah, Manhattan

516
00:48:22,832 --> 00:48:25,882
Beauty salon called Georgina

517
00:48:27,896 --> 00:48:31,836
Yeah, right. Yes. Yes.
Georgiana's. That's right

518
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,820
Thank you

519
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:46,807
Hello, I'm calling to confirm
an appointment today, 12:30

520
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:51,841
Sumner. Connie Sumner.
S-u-m-n-e-r

521
00:48:55,859 --> 00:49:00,832
Could she... could she
be down for another time?

522
00:49:05,803 --> 00:49:06,896
No, thank you

523
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,895
Connie!

524
00:49:30,896 --> 00:49:33,879
Connie! Connie...

525
00:49:33,882 --> 00:49:36,843
- Tracy! Hi!
- Hi

526
00:49:36,846 --> 00:49:37,892
I was gonna call you

527
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:40,862
That's what they all say when
I call about bunny costumes

528
00:49:40,864 --> 00:49:43,800
You know Sally
from Planned Parenthood?

529
00:49:43,801 --> 00:49:44,810
Hi. It's been a while

530
00:49:44,821 --> 00:49:45,881
Well, too long. Too long

531
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:47,823
You look amazing

532
00:49:47,826 --> 00:49:48,844
So where you headed?

533
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:50,847
Oh, I was just going to...

534
00:49:50,858 --> 00:49:52,864
go look at some window
shades for the kitchen

535
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:54,838
Well, we're gonna go
and have coffee

536
00:49:54,848 --> 00:49:56,817
Why don't you join us?

537
00:49:56,818 --> 00:49:58,848
Oh, I'm gonna be late

538
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:00,861
For window shades?

539
00:50:01,842 --> 00:50:02,857
Come on!

540
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,882
Ok. Ok

541
00:50:09,863 --> 00:50:11,876
Hi, how are you?

542
00:50:17,877 --> 00:50:20,817
I'm just going to make
a phone call

543
00:50:20,828 --> 00:50:21,881
Sure

544
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:25,858
She could have
used my cell phone

545
00:50:30,845 --> 00:50:31,881
Hi, it's me

546
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:34,826
You're not gonna believe this...

547
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:36,845
I'm at the cafe
around the corner

548
00:50:36,856 --> 00:50:39,898
Why do you have to introduce me
as Sally from Planned Parenthood?

549
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:40,896
What do you mean?

550
00:50:41,807 --> 00:50:44,826
Well, it makes it sound like I'm
in New York handing out condoms

551
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:46,807
I'm stuck here

552
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:50,830
Will you wait for me?

553
00:50:50,891 --> 00:50:52,821
Wait for me

554
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:55,871
with the redhead.
Just can't take it

555
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:57,861
She has it the next
morning... all the time

556
00:50:57,872 --> 00:50:58,898
Had to call Gloria, remind her...

557
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:01,855
to pick up the dry cleaning
when she gets Charlie

558
00:51:01,865 --> 00:51:03,885
Never a dull moment

559
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:06,842
No. Charlie is so adorable

560
00:51:07,802 --> 00:51:08,839
Thank you

561
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,878
I can't eat

562
00:51:29,831 --> 00:51:30,828
I'll have a coffee

563
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,898
Well, I guess I'll have coffee, too

564
00:51:34,812 --> 00:51:36,861
Excuse me again. Ladies room

565
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:42,839
God, she looks good

566
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,895
Do you think she's had work?

567
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:46,880
Why would she have work?
She still looks gorgeous

568
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:47,889
That's when they're having it now

569
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,803
Early, before it all goes to shit

570
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:07,822
I have friends out there

571
00:52:14,853 --> 00:52:16,875
You take me to the best places

572
00:52:17,816 --> 00:52:18,865
Wait

573
00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:20,883
Let me...

574
00:52:24,887 --> 00:52:27,840
She's not like that.
She's really nice

575
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:30,804
Of course she is.
That makes it worse

576
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,844
She is nice, and she's sweet...

577
00:52:32,855 --> 00:52:34,841
and her ass is in exactly
the same place it was

578
00:52:34,842 --> 00:52:36,828
when she was in college

579
00:52:42,872 --> 00:52:44,846
Are you taking tennis?

580
00:52:44,856 --> 00:52:48,845
Oh, I wouldn't call
what I do taking tennis

581
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:52,808
- Ok
- There you are

582
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:53,852
I was beginning to worry

583
00:52:53,854 --> 00:52:55,854
No, it's fine. I'm fine

584
00:52:55,864 --> 00:52:58,854
We thought you were
abducted by that heartthrob

585
00:52:59,864 --> 00:53:01,827
What heartthrob?

586
00:53:01,828 --> 00:53:03,814
You didn't see him at the counter?

587
00:53:03,817 --> 00:53:04,827
He was gorgeous

588
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:07,861
I miss everything

589
00:53:07,862 --> 00:53:09,817
Your button's undone

590
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:11,845
Oh, thank you

591
00:53:16,816 --> 00:53:17,899
That's him

592
00:53:26,857 --> 00:53:28,844
I guess I could see the appeal

593
00:53:28,847 --> 00:53:31,853
Well, if he looked at me twice,
I would be on my back in a second

594
00:53:31,857 --> 00:53:32,831
Oh, you would not

595
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:33,897
Oh, I would so. Why not?

596
00:53:34,808 --> 00:53:36,897
Well, a couple of reasons.
Adam for one, your kids for another

597
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,877
Well, you know, Tracy, they
wouldn't have to know about it

598
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:42,844
It could be just something
that I did for myself

599
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:45,872
You know, to... broaden my horizons

600
00:53:45,882 --> 00:53:47,865
It'd be like taking a pottery class

601
00:53:47,886 --> 00:53:50,885
Having an affair is nothing
like taking a pottery class

602
00:53:50,886 --> 00:53:53,826
- Could be
- No. It would start out like that

603
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,877
And then, something would happen

604
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:58,890
Someone finds out,
or someone falls in love...

605
00:53:58,894 --> 00:54:00,889
and it ends disastrously

606
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:04,890
They always end disastrously

607
00:54:13,895 --> 00:54:15,818
Tracy!

608
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:18,835
No

609
00:54:18,846 --> 00:54:19,885
When?

610
00:54:20,876 --> 00:54:22,852
It was a long time ago

611
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:27,805
And it's the one thing in my
life I would undo if I could

612
00:54:35,807 --> 00:54:37,890
Did you just fuck me
across the street?

613
00:54:39,804 --> 00:54:40,864
I did

614
00:54:41,855 --> 00:54:44,877
You know, we could end this
now, and no one would get hurt

615
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,842
Yeah?

616
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:51,819
I think if we ended
this now... I'd get hurt

617
00:54:51,862 --> 00:54:54,838
So, no matter what,
someone get's hurt?

618
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:56,802
Maybe not

619
00:54:56,853 --> 00:54:58,873
Maybe we'll get tired of each other

620
00:54:59,823 --> 00:55:01,849
God, I hope I get tired of you

621
00:55:06,847 --> 00:55:08,834
You're in my mind

622
00:55:08,864 --> 00:55:13,891
You're the only thing in my
mind when I wake up every morning

623
00:55:15,818 --> 00:55:18,831
You're in my brain
before I even open my eyes

624
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:20,815
What do you think of?

625
00:55:20,825 --> 00:55:21,888
It depends

626
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:24,849
If it's a day when I don't know
if I'm going to get to see you

627
00:55:24,852 --> 00:55:30,863
I'm anxious... thinking of excuses
to come into the city and see you

628
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,879
And the days you know we meet?

629
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,847
On those days...

630
00:55:39,887 --> 00:55:41,837
I'm...

631
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:43,844
calm...

632
00:55:43,848 --> 00:55:45,891
and... hating myself

633
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:50,874
Oh, God

634
00:55:55,892 --> 00:55:58,852
This is what we have over here

635
00:55:58,883 --> 00:56:02,845
And... I'll have it ready
for you this afternoon

636
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:04,825
That happens all the time...

637
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,856
Ed, what's up? It sounded important

638
00:56:09,854 --> 00:56:12,820
I've heard you're talking
with Dunbar and Brinks...

639
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:13,893
a few other companies

640
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,820
Oh, yeah? Where'd you hear that?

641
00:56:17,868 --> 00:56:20,897
Well, look, I mean, I
suppose they could be...

642
00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:22,888
wooing me,
if that's what you mean

643
00:56:22,892 --> 00:56:26,815
Apparently a lot of people
are wooing you these days

644
00:56:26,846 --> 00:56:28,841
Now, who's wooing who?

645
00:56:28,842 --> 00:56:30,898
Wait.
What are you talking about?

646
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:33,815
So I talked
to some people. So what?

647
00:56:33,816 --> 00:56:35,843
This is about loyalty, Bill

648
00:56:35,883 --> 00:56:37,853
I'm letting you go

649
00:56:37,857 --> 00:56:40,849
You'll have my
recommendation, if you need it

650
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:45,833
I have a family, Ed

651
00:56:45,884 --> 00:56:48,833
You had a family here

652
00:56:48,834 --> 00:56:52,849
Wait. Wait a minute. You're
telling me... about family?

653
00:56:53,803 --> 00:56:56,804
Well, you don't know the
first goddamn thing about it!

654
00:57:00,886 --> 00:57:03,858
Why don't you take a look at
your own fucking family, Ed?

655
00:57:03,873 --> 00:57:06,830
Take a goddamn look at that

656
00:57:24,892 --> 00:57:26,875
- Hi, Ed
- Frank

657
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:32,838
Thanks for coming
on such short notice

658
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:35,829
This is personal.
It's not business...

659
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:37,849
So you think about it

660
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:39,886
I don't know if you're gonna
want to get involved with this..

661
00:57:39,887 --> 00:57:42,827
But I need someone I can trust

662
00:57:42,837 --> 00:57:44,856
I want you to follow somebody

663
00:57:45,857 --> 00:57:46,887
I...

664
00:57:48,857 --> 00:57:51,810
I want you to follow my wife

665
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,825
It's burning, Mom

666
00:58:03,836 --> 00:58:04,836
What?

667
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,805
It's burning. The chicken

668
00:58:07,806 --> 00:58:08,866
Oh, shit!

669
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:12,875
Shit

670
00:58:21,827 --> 00:58:23,800
It's boiling, Mom

671
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:24,857
It's boiling!

672
00:58:24,858 --> 00:58:25,874
Thank you

673
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:31,898
Watch it. Watch it.
Watch it. Watch it

674
00:58:44,883 --> 00:58:47,836
Chicken's a little dry. I'm sorry

675
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:48,870
It's fine

676
00:58:53,894 --> 00:58:56,844
I have to go to Chicago tomorrow

677
00:58:58,828 --> 00:58:59,867
For how long?

678
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:01,871
Not long. Probably just a night

679
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,848
What time's your flight?

680
00:59:03,879 --> 00:59:05,838
8:00

681
00:59:06,862 --> 00:59:08,822
A. M.

682
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,849
Diane Dryer's son is
marrying Amy Lynne's daughter

683
00:59:14,853 --> 00:59:16,876
I'm never getting married

684
00:59:17,816 --> 00:59:18,816
Why not?

685
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:20,829
I hate giris

686
00:59:22,857 --> 00:59:24,860
Well, you might change your mind

687
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,850
That happens sometimes

688
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:28,808
I won't

689
00:59:32,878 --> 00:59:33,868
What?

690
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,872
I fired Bill Stone today

691
00:59:37,842 --> 00:59:39,821
So that's what's bothering you

692
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:41,811
Nothing's bothering me

693
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:43,811
Why did you fire him?

694
00:59:45,813 --> 00:59:46,846
He's not accountable

695
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:49,803
What's accountable?

696
00:59:49,813 --> 00:59:51,843
Is it, like, people who eat people?

697
00:59:52,803 --> 00:59:54,887
No, no... that's a cannibal

698
00:59:57,841 --> 01:00:00,820
Anyway, I can't
trust him anymore

699
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:03,845
So if you run into
Dolly, you'll know

700
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:22,816
Well, how are you gonna clean up the
area so pedestrians can get through?

701
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:41,817
What?!

702
01:01:41,858 --> 01:01:42,898
I can't believe you!

703
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:45,822
What are you doing?

704
01:02:11,881 --> 01:02:13,807
Shit!

705
01:02:13,808 --> 01:02:14,808
Charlie...!

706
01:02:15,842 --> 01:02:16,868
Shit!

707
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,800
Come on!

708
01:02:54,886 --> 01:02:57,809
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

709
01:02:57,819 --> 01:02:58,849
I', sorry

710
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:00,819
Honey, are you ok?

711
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:02,822
You must have been so worried?

712
01:03:02,823 --> 01:03:03,851
- Stop, Mom
- What?

713
01:03:03,852 --> 01:03:05,829
- People can we see
- Ok

714
01:03:28,856 --> 01:03:30,803
Hi, this is Paul Martel

715
01:03:30,813 --> 01:03:31,892
Leave a message after
the beep. Thanks

716
01:03:32,803 --> 01:03:33,812
Mom?

717
01:03:33,823 --> 01:03:35,803
Honey...

718
01:03:35,873 --> 01:03:37,860
You're supposed to be in bed

719
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,893
You're crying, Mom

720
01:03:39,894 --> 01:03:41,874
Oh, honey...

721
01:03:42,844 --> 01:03:44,893
mommy's just a little sad,
that's all

722
01:03:45,824 --> 01:03:47,827
Come on, I'll take you to bed

723
01:03:47,855 --> 01:03:49,857
Let's get you into bed

724
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:51,805
Don't be sad, Mom

725
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:53,831
Dad will be home tomorrow

726
01:04:02,826 --> 01:04:04,863
His name is Paul Martel

727
01:04:09,867 --> 01:04:13,813
He lives at 433 Mercer Street,
apartment 3

728
01:04:13,897 --> 01:04:16,816
She sees him during the day

729
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,857
Usually goes around lunchtime

730
01:04:20,818 --> 01:04:22,891
Stays about 2 hours, maybe 3

731
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:38,870
They go to the movies?

732
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:42,803
They did that day. Otherwise,
they're in his apartment

733
01:05:55,874 --> 01:05:57,844
Pick up!

734
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:21,863
Hey. Hey, lady!

735
01:06:22,864 --> 01:06:24,810
Forgot your keys

736
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:06,852
Wait!

737
01:07:08,855 --> 01:07:10,824
Who is she?! Who is she?!

738
01:07:10,855 --> 01:07:11,822
No!

739
01:07:11,832 --> 01:07:12,822
Calm down!

740
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:14,879
Why are you doing this?

741
01:07:18,806 --> 01:07:20,846
How many are there? 5? 10?

742
01:07:22,827 --> 01:07:24,803
God, what am I?

743
01:07:24,814 --> 01:07:26,833
The Monday one. What,
did I get my day wrong?

744
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:28,856
She's just a friend, ok?

745
01:07:28,867 --> 01:07:30,816
Just a friend

746
01:07:31,818 --> 01:07:33,817
You're a fuckin' liar

747
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:35,867
Me? I'm the liar?

748
01:07:35,878 --> 01:07:37,858
I can't do this anymore

749
01:07:40,885 --> 01:07:42,894
Fine. Go back to
your suburban carpool

750
01:07:42,895 --> 01:07:44,819
Your tennis dress on your...

751
01:07:44,829 --> 01:07:46,828
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

752
01:07:46,899 --> 01:07:48,825
Fuck you!

753
01:07:48,886 --> 01:07:50,809
That'll make you happy

754
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:51,856
Fuck you!

755
01:07:58,894 --> 01:07:59,837
No

756
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:01,813
No, I can't

757
01:08:01,824 --> 01:08:03,821
Paul, it's over

758
01:08:05,888 --> 01:08:06,895
I can't!

759
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:15,871
I hate you. I hate you

760
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:16,832
I know

761
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,845
Stop it. I can't

762
01:08:39,805 --> 01:08:40,855
You gonna fuck me?

763
01:08:40,856 --> 01:08:41,861
You want it?

764
01:08:41,872 --> 01:08:42,884
Yeah, I want you to

765
01:08:42,895 --> 01:08:43,888
Say it

766
01:08:43,898 --> 01:08:45,838
- I want you to fuck me
- Say it

767
01:08:45,849 --> 01:08:47,832
I want you to fuck me

768
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:41,827
Oh, thank you

769
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:42,870
Thank you very much

770
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:45,811
Thank you very much, indeed

771
01:11:06,866 --> 01:11:07,869
Yes?

772
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,800
You're Paul Martel?

773
01:11:11,804 --> 01:11:12,830
Yes

774
01:11:13,831 --> 01:11:14,873
How old are you?

775
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:19,801
Who are you?

776
01:11:20,801 --> 01:11:21,864
Edward Sumner

777
01:11:23,865 --> 01:11:25,858
Connie's husband

778
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,822
May I...

779
01:11:34,853 --> 01:11:35,895
may I come in?

780
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,813
Yeah. Sure

781
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,846
Would you like a drink?

782
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:12,843
Yeah. Why not?

783
01:12:23,828 --> 01:12:27,801
I have scotch,
vodka... prune juice

784
01:12:27,825 --> 01:12:29,811
Vodka

785
01:12:30,865 --> 01:12:32,811
Is it cold?

786
01:12:33,822 --> 01:12:34,851
Yeah

787
01:12:36,802 --> 01:12:38,815
I keep it in the freezer

788
01:12:38,826 --> 01:12:41,826
So do I. At home

789
01:12:58,865 --> 01:13:01,831
So tell me, how did you...

790
01:13:01,842 --> 01:13:03,801
meet my wife?

791
01:13:04,862 --> 01:13:06,848
By accident

792
01:13:06,889 --> 01:13:08,861
On the street

793
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:11,855
There was a wind storm,
she hooked her knee...

794
01:13:11,859 --> 01:13:13,869
Oh... you're him

795
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,846
She told you about that?

796
01:13:16,847 --> 01:13:17,859
Yes

797
01:13:23,841 --> 01:13:24,877
How's it going?

798
01:13:27,844 --> 01:13:28,840
Fine

799
01:13:29,811 --> 01:13:30,881
Fine. I mean, ok

800
01:13:31,815 --> 01:13:33,847
This is... this is where you meet?

801
01:13:33,848 --> 01:13:34,888
Yes

802
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:37,834
She likes it?

803
01:13:37,835 --> 01:13:39,872
Well, I guess.
She never complained

804
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:46,899
Do you stay in all the time,
or do you go out, too?

805
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,830
It depends. Sometimes,
yes, we go out

806
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:52,890
She likes that?

807
01:13:52,894 --> 01:13:54,827
She...

808
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,810
likes this neighborhood?

809
01:13:57,813 --> 01:13:58,843
Oh, yeah

810
01:13:58,844 --> 01:14:00,894
More exciting than
the suburbs, I guess

811
01:14:05,828 --> 01:14:09,811
Do you know that we have
been married 11 years?

812
01:14:10,802 --> 01:14:11,875
We have a son

813
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:15,842
Yeah, she told me

814
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:19,859
More?

815
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:22,809
Yes, please

816
01:14:35,821 --> 01:14:37,888
He's the reason
that we left the city

817
01:14:38,858 --> 01:14:41,858
Connie thought it
would be better for him

818
01:14:41,862 --> 01:14:43,871
Oh. She told me it was your idea

819
01:14:46,826 --> 01:14:49,876
You... talk about me?

820
01:15:08,898 --> 01:15:10,865
Lot of books...

821
01:15:10,895 --> 01:15:13,888
Yeah. Lot of buying and selling

822
01:15:54,823 --> 01:15:56,826
Didn't know it did that

823
01:16:02,834 --> 01:16:03,893
Where did you get this?

824
01:16:04,814 --> 01:16:05,844
It was a gift

825
01:16:06,804 --> 01:16:07,843
From her

826
01:16:20,879 --> 01:16:22,862
Why would she do that?

827
01:16:22,866 --> 01:16:24,829
I don't know...

828
01:16:25,819 --> 01:16:28,890
Maybe... maybe she just
wanted to buy me something

829
01:16:33,817 --> 01:16:36,830
She didn't buy this for you.
I gave it to her

830
01:16:44,841 --> 01:16:45,870
I gave it to her...

831
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:47,831
What?

832
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:50,841
I gave it to her

833
01:16:50,852 --> 01:16:53,808
I gave... I'm s...

834
01:16:55,836 --> 01:16:59,826
I'm feeling sick. I can't...

835
01:16:59,836 --> 01:17:01,806
You want some water?

836
01:17:02,846 --> 01:17:05,859
I'm feeling sick. I'm...

837
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:07,867
I don't...

838
01:17:11,838 --> 01:17:14,804
I'm... I'm not well

839
01:17:14,845 --> 01:17:16,807
I'm not feeling well

840
01:17:21,828 --> 01:17:23,805
I'm not...

841
01:17:23,855 --> 01:17:25,821
I'm not feeling...

842
01:18:23,845 --> 01:18:24,895
God!

843
01:21:02,888 --> 01:21:04,801
Hi, this is Paul Martel

844
01:21:04,822 --> 01:21:07,818
Leave a message after
the beep. Thanks.

845
01:21:07,849 --> 01:21:09,825
Hi, it's me

846
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,869
Listen...

847
01:21:12,856 --> 01:21:16,802
I don't like saying this
to your machine, but...

848
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,890
I have to end this

849
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,880
I just... I can't do it anymore

850
01:21:26,884 --> 01:21:29,867
I can't live like this

851
01:21:29,878 --> 01:21:34,810
I'm so tired of lying
and hurting my family

852
01:21:35,821 --> 01:21:36,891
I'm sorry

853
01:21:37,832 --> 01:21:42,815
I hope... I
don't know what I hope

854
01:21:43,806 --> 01:21:44,892
I'm... I'm sorry

855
01:22:52,896 --> 01:22:55,809
Messages erased

856
01:23:09,831 --> 01:23:10,847
Does that pinch?

857
01:23:10,858 --> 01:23:12,810
No

858
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:14,807
Do you know your solo?

859
01:23:14,808 --> 01:23:14,888
- Yep
- Yeah?

860
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:17,838
Can I hear it?

861
01:24:46,851 --> 01:24:47,839
You need a hand?

862
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,640
No

863
01:24:48,801 --> 01:24:49,850
No, I'm fine

864
01:24:49,872 --> 01:24:51,824
Thanks

865
01:25:13,804 --> 01:25:16,820
focus on the journey

866
01:25:16,831 --> 01:25:18,847
for there will be those

867
01:25:18,858 --> 01:25:22,841
who will love to see you fall

868
01:25:56,858 --> 01:25:59,848
Catch a star from the sky

869
01:25:59,859 --> 01:26:02,875
Let it sparkle in your eye

870
01:26:02,886 --> 01:26:05,863
Set your sights above the crowd

871
01:26:05,873 --> 01:26:08,892
Walk tall, dream loud

872
01:26:09,803 --> 01:26:11,897
Take your mark and go

873
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:14,833
focus on the journey

874
01:26:14,844 --> 01:26:15,843
Where were you?

875
01:26:16,877 --> 01:26:17,884
You ok?

876
01:26:17,887 --> 01:26:21,828
Who will love to see you fall

877
01:26:21,838 --> 01:26:24,857
All along the way

878
01:26:24,868 --> 01:26:27,867
hiding on the sidelines

879
01:26:27,878 --> 01:26:30,825
they must be the ones

880
01:26:30,835 --> 01:26:33,891
who have never dreamed at all

881
01:26:34,802 --> 01:26:37,848
Catch a star from the sky

882
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,822
Let it sparkle in your eye

883
01:26:40,833 --> 01:26:43,856
Set your sights above the crowd

884
01:26:43,867 --> 01:26:46,883
Walk tall, dream loud

885
01:26:51,898 --> 01:26:54,821
What's the sense in dreaming

886
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:57,814
if your dreams are small?

887
01:26:57,825 --> 01:27:00,838
What's the sense in walking

888
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:03,808
if you don't walk tall?

889
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:06,851
Dream loud

890
01:27:52,887 --> 01:27:55,816
You were spectacular.
You know that?

891
01:27:56,841 --> 01:27:59,800
- Wasn't he great, Edward?
- Great

892
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:01,886
He was great, great

893
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:04,821
Really great

894
01:28:04,888 --> 01:28:06,814
I have to help clean up

895
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:08,898
I'll come and kiss you good
night later when I get home, ok?

896
01:28:17,873 --> 01:28:18,896
Sorry, Ed

897
01:28:19,807 --> 01:28:21,806
It looks like I nailed you

898
01:28:23,847 --> 01:28:25,877
It's all right, Jerry. It's ok

899
01:28:31,885 --> 01:28:34,821
You'd better check to
see if this is gonna open

900
01:28:34,831 --> 01:28:35,871
No, no, this is... this is fine

901
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:38,841
It's nothing.
It's nothing. It's fine

902
01:28:42,862 --> 01:28:44,812
Did he dent you, Dad?

903
01:28:44,863 --> 01:28:47,802
Yeah. Yes, he did. Yes, he did

904
01:28:47,813 --> 01:28:49,849
Can we call the cops, Dad?

905
01:28:51,867 --> 01:28:53,835
You sure you don't
wanna check the trunk?

906
01:28:53,836 --> 01:28:55,827
- We'll deal with it tomorrow
- It'll just take a second

907
01:28:55,828 --> 01:28:56,827
No!

908
01:32:02,883 --> 01:32:04,820
Oh, my God

909
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:05,870
Charlie...

910
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,859
look at your dad and
tell me what's wrong

911
01:32:10,881 --> 01:32:12,823
What?

912
01:32:13,881 --> 01:32:15,837
His shoes!

913
01:32:15,888 --> 01:32:17,894
They're different colors

914
01:32:25,845 --> 01:32:27,811
Honey, you look awful

915
01:32:27,872 --> 01:32:29,835
What happened last night?
Did you sleep?

916
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:31,872
I got up and looked for you

917
01:32:31,873 --> 01:32:33,886
Oh, I just...

918
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:37,813
got some air

919
01:32:37,823 --> 01:32:38,890
Are you ok?

920
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:41,874
Yeah

921
01:32:53,845 --> 01:32:55,874
Do you like it here, Connie?

922
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:57,815
What?

923
01:32:58,815 --> 01:32:59,842
Of course I like it here

924
01:32:59,846 --> 01:33:00,869
'Cause we don't have to stay here

925
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:03,819
We can... we can
move back to the city

926
01:33:04,869 --> 01:33:07,875
Honey, what has gotten into you?

927
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,840
Are you ok?

928
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:14,867
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine

929
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:18,880
Are you ok?

930
01:33:18,891 --> 01:33:21,810
I'm fine

931
01:33:21,861 --> 01:33:25,834
Everybody's fine, and
we're not moving anywhere

932
01:34:07,873 --> 01:34:09,865
The cops are here, Mom

933
01:34:11,823 --> 01:34:12,870
What do they want?

934
01:34:12,871 --> 01:34:14,866
I'm sure it's nothing

935
01:34:21,847 --> 01:34:23,867
N.Y.P.D., Mom

936
01:34:25,845 --> 01:34:26,834
Hello

937
01:34:26,845 --> 01:34:27,861
- Mrs. Sumner
- Yes

938
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:29,807
Yeah, I'm detective Dean

939
01:34:29,808 --> 01:34:30,857
This is detective Mirojnick...

940
01:34:30,868 --> 01:34:32,813
New York City Police Department

941
01:34:32,814 --> 01:34:33,844
Did something happen?
Is something wrong?

942
01:34:33,845 --> 01:34:34,878
Oh, no, no. No...

943
01:34:34,879 --> 01:34:36,899
do you know a Paul Martel?

944
01:34:37,859 --> 01:34:41,842
Yes, not very well. Why?

945
01:34:41,853 --> 01:34:43,809
Do you know where he is?

946
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,840
No.

947
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,800
At home, I would imagine

948
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:52,877
Do you know where he lives?

949
01:34:53,807 --> 01:34:55,827
Soho, isn't it?

950
01:34:56,818 --> 01:34:59,835
Your name and number
were found on his desk

951
01:35:01,835 --> 01:35:02,887
Has he done something wrong?

952
01:35:02,888 --> 01:35:06,822
Well, we don't know. He's been
reported missing by his family

953
01:35:06,845 --> 01:35:08,815
His wife doesn't know where he is

954
01:35:12,803 --> 01:35:13,886
I didn't know he was married

955
01:35:15,803 --> 01:35:16,853
Separated

956
01:35:21,824 --> 01:35:22,890
When did you see him last?

957
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:27,874
I don't know... It's hard to say

958
01:35:29,894 --> 01:35:31,871
he's a book dealer. I...

959
01:35:31,881 --> 01:35:34,897
I barely know him at all. I was
going to buy some books from him

960
01:35:35,818 --> 01:35:35,894
And did you?

961
01:35:36,805 --> 01:35:38,855
No, not yet

962
01:35:41,856 --> 01:35:44,848
Has something happened to him?
I mean, do you think he's all right?

963
01:35:44,852 --> 01:35:46,849
It's hard to say at this point

964
01:35:47,859 --> 01:35:48,899
We're workin' on it

965
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,820
Anyway, thanks...
thanks for your time

966
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:54,879
Thank you

967
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:57,876
I like these snow glass things

968
01:35:57,877 --> 01:35:59,803
My boy has some of these

969
01:35:59,814 --> 01:36:01,833
If you hear from Mr. Martel,
let us know

970
01:36:01,834 --> 01:36:02,870
Certainly

971
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:33,818
Dad! The cops came
to our house today

972
01:36:35,828 --> 01:36:37,854
Cops? What did they want?

973
01:36:41,889 --> 01:36:45,895
Someone's missing... and they
have to check everyone, you know

974
01:36:50,866 --> 01:36:51,889
Who was it?

975
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,866
Honey, sit up straight

976
01:36:57,887 --> 01:36:58,893
Who was it?

977
01:36:58,894 --> 01:37:00,803
I don't think you know him

978
01:37:00,814 --> 01:37:02,873
He's... he sells books

979
01:37:03,864 --> 01:37:05,851
I forget where I met him

980
01:37:06,861 --> 01:37:08,854
Was it a bad guy, Mom?

981
01:37:11,801 --> 01:37:14,817
So what did they... why
did they wanna talk to you?

982
01:37:14,885 --> 01:37:17,891
I guess... he had my name and number

983
01:37:19,822 --> 01:37:21,852
Why... why would
he have your number?

984
01:37:23,819 --> 01:37:25,819
I think I bought a book from him

985
01:37:37,864 --> 01:37:39,807
Be careful. Be careful

986
01:37:39,808 --> 01:37:40,818
Hey, Charlie

987
01:37:40,891 --> 01:37:42,814
Hi, darlin'

988
01:37:42,825 --> 01:37:44,841
Oh, I wish you lived closer

989
01:37:48,839 --> 01:37:52,878
Lord, bless this food to our
use and us to thy service...

990
01:37:53,823 --> 01:37:57,825
and help us to be ever
mindful of the needs of others

991
01:37:57,829 --> 01:37:57,876
Amen

992
01:37:57,886 --> 01:38:00,823
Amen

993
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:02,843
Edward!

994
01:38:12,828 --> 01:38:13,881
All right!

995
01:38:22,836 --> 01:38:24,885
I have a... I have a story
you don't know about Edward

996
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,845
He was at the club...

997
01:39:14,831 --> 01:39:16,814
Hello, Mrs. Sumner

998
01:39:16,825 --> 01:39:18,878
Sorry to bother you on the weekend

999
01:39:18,888 --> 01:39:20,877
I'm... detective Dean

1000
01:39:20,885 --> 01:39:22,864
This is detective Mirojnick, N.Y.P.D.

1001
01:39:22,865 --> 01:39:23,835
Ok

1002
01:39:23,845 --> 01:39:26,804
We were hoping to talk
to you for a few minutes

1003
01:39:26,822 --> 01:39:28,835
Sure

1004
01:39:28,846 --> 01:39:30,862
Charlie, we're gonna go up
on the porch for a minute

1005
01:39:30,863 --> 01:39:31,852
Can I come?

1006
01:39:31,863 --> 01:39:33,859
No, sweetheart.
You stay out here

1007
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:35,863
Play with Poppy.
We'll be right back

1008
01:39:37,803 --> 01:39:38,850
I don't know if
your wife mentioned

1009
01:39:38,851 --> 01:39:40,863
we was here about a
week and a half ago...

1010
01:39:40,873 --> 01:39:42,826
about Paul Martel

1011
01:39:42,837 --> 01:39:44,866
Yeah, that was the...
the man who was missing

1012
01:39:44,867 --> 01:39:46,891
Well, he's not missing anymore

1013
01:39:47,804 --> 01:39:49,880
His body was discovered last weekend

1014
01:39:50,871 --> 01:39:53,821
God, that's... that's terrible

1015
01:39:55,812 --> 01:39:56,875
Oh, my God

1016
01:39:56,879 --> 01:40:01,815
Do you recall where you met
Mr. Martel, Mrs. Sumner?

1017
01:40:02,816 --> 01:40:04,882
- I told you
- No, ma'am, you didn't

1018
01:40:04,896 --> 01:40:06,888
I'm sorry...

1019
01:40:07,818 --> 01:40:09,819
I can't remember

1020
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:11,865
A fund-raiser, I think

1021
01:40:11,868 --> 01:40:13,830
Can you be more specific?

1022
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,827
Juilliard

1023
01:40:17,801 --> 01:40:18,864
Juilliard

1024
01:40:19,844 --> 01:40:20,831
The music school

1025
01:40:21,805 --> 01:40:23,807
Yes, I know what Juilliard is

1026
01:40:23,808 --> 01:40:25,821
Oh, of course you do. I'm sorry

1027
01:40:25,822 --> 01:40:27,825
Were you there, too, sir?

1028
01:40:28,885 --> 01:40:31,822
Yes, yes... I think I was

1029
01:40:31,862 --> 01:40:34,825
Well, maybe you met Mr. Martel

1030
01:40:35,896 --> 01:40:38,810
No, no, not that I remember

1031
01:40:38,813 --> 01:40:39,873
Maybe you'd recognize him

1032
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:43,877
No, no. I never met him before

1033
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,833
- Is that him?
- Yes, yes

1034
01:40:47,831 --> 01:40:49,834
You ever been to his apartment?

1035
01:40:50,814 --> 01:40:51,853
No

1036
01:40:51,864 --> 01:40:53,864
No, I... I... I hardly knew him

1037
01:40:53,868 --> 01:40:55,897
I didn't even know why
he had my phone number

1038
01:40:55,898 --> 01:40:57,834
Maybe he liked you

1039
01:40:57,865 --> 01:41:00,822
Look, I think that's enough

1040
01:41:02,872 --> 01:41:04,874
So you've never been
to his apartment

1041
01:41:04,877 --> 01:41:08,805
Well, how 'bout, the neighborhood.
Did you hang out down there?

1042
01:41:08,806 --> 01:41:10,882
- No
- No, not often...

1043
01:41:10,883 --> 01:41:13,866
- ...or no, never
- Never

1044
01:41:13,873 --> 01:41:16,813
I can't remember the
last time I was in Soho

1045
01:41:16,814 --> 01:41:18,833
It was 4 weeks ago, actually

1046
01:41:20,877 --> 01:41:23,853
You got a parking ticket right
in front of Martel's apartment...

1047
01:41:23,854 --> 01:41:24,887
4 weeks ago

1048
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:27,807
Oh, that. Right

1049
01:41:27,808 --> 01:41:30,864
I... had coffee with
friends at a little place

1050
01:41:30,865 --> 01:41:31,865
I forgot

1051
01:41:31,868 --> 01:41:35,802
- It was Tracy and Sally
- Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah

1052
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:48,836
Look...

1053
01:41:50,827 --> 01:41:53,886
my wife has told you everything
she knows. So have I. So...

1054
01:41:54,854 --> 01:41:57,834
if you don't mind, we'd
like to get back to our son

1055
01:41:57,837 --> 01:41:59,857
All right.

1056
01:41:59,868 --> 01:42:02,805
Why don't I give you my card...

1057
01:42:02,808 --> 01:42:03,861
I have your card

1058
01:42:05,802 --> 01:42:06,818
Right

1059
01:42:07,866 --> 01:42:09,889
- Enjoy your weekend
- You, too

1060
01:43:05,878 --> 01:43:07,854
Sumner, please

1061
01:43:46,849 --> 01:43:48,825
Oh, my God

1062
01:43:49,889 --> 01:43:51,879
Hi, Connie

1063
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,836
Hi, Tracy

1064
01:43:54,847 --> 01:43:57,873
I'm just picking up my
silk suit for tonight

1065
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:02,810
I was thinking of wearing the black

1066
01:44:14,845 --> 01:44:16,818
I'm gonna give up the good row

1067
01:44:16,819 --> 01:44:19,811
Let someone else be
gorgeous for a change

1068
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:26,859
So what should we bring aside
from our sparkling personalities?

1069
01:44:31,824 --> 01:44:32,840
How we doing?

1070
01:44:32,881 --> 01:44:34,803
Fine

1071
01:44:34,814 --> 01:44:35,823
You need help?

1072
01:44:35,824 --> 01:44:36,863
No

1073
01:44:38,881 --> 01:44:43,801
The white is not cold, so I'm
gonna put it in the freezer

1074
01:44:44,832 --> 01:44:46,898
Just remind me it's
in there, all right?

1075
01:44:49,832 --> 01:44:51,831
Most people drink red anyway

1076
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:57,876
Oh, I love these things

1077
01:44:57,886 --> 01:44:59,876
Is there anyplace
you guys haven't been?

1078
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:03,850
The Rosenthals
got 795 for their place

1079
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:05,810
In 2 days, they had 6 offers

1080
01:45:05,811 --> 01:45:07,804
Sealed bids. That's
what everyone's doing now

1081
01:45:07,807 --> 01:45:08,897
What do you think
this place is worth, Ed?

1082
01:45:09,848 --> 01:45:11,847
Oh, I don't know

1083
01:45:11,858 --> 01:45:13,878
You sell your house,
where do you go?

1084
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:15,854
At those prices, Tahiti

1085
01:45:15,858 --> 01:45:16,887
Bangkok

1086
01:45:16,898 --> 01:45:19,835
Connie, where's this one from?

1087
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:31,863
Fiji

1088
01:45:32,823 --> 01:45:34,877
Oh, remember, Jeff, I asked
you to take me to Fiji?

1089
01:45:35,867 --> 01:45:36,897
And then you took me to Hawaii?

1090
01:45:37,807 --> 01:45:39,804
We went fishing every single day...

1091
01:46:03,807 --> 01:46:04,883
What happened, Edward?

1092
01:46:07,877 --> 01:46:09,874
What did you do?

1093
01:46:11,824 --> 01:46:12,876
Did you hurt him?

1094
01:46:17,825 --> 01:46:18,868
Edward?

1095
01:46:19,898 --> 01:46:21,868
Did you hurt him?

1096
01:46:24,835 --> 01:46:25,895
You did, didn't you?

1097
01:46:26,886 --> 01:46:30,842
Oh, Jesus, Edward

1098
01:46:32,813 --> 01:46:34,800
Talk to me

1099
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,880
Tell me what you did

1100
01:46:36,883 --> 01:46:40,839
No, you tell me what you did

1101
01:46:40,890 --> 01:46:43,890
How you fucked him over
and over and over...

1102
01:46:44,801 --> 01:46:45,874
You lied to me...

1103
01:46:45,884 --> 01:46:48,857
over and over and over...

1104
01:46:48,858 --> 01:46:49,887
Edward, please...

1105
01:46:49,888 --> 01:46:52,821
No, you don't talk to me now

1106
01:46:52,822 --> 01:46:54,855
I gave everything...

1107
01:46:55,835 --> 01:46:57,875
for this family

1108
01:46:58,806 --> 01:46:59,852
Everything...

1109
01:47:00,872 --> 01:47:03,859
Snd what did you do?

1110
01:47:04,830 --> 01:47:06,823
You threw it all away...

1111
01:47:06,833 --> 01:47:08,816
like it was nothing

1112
01:47:08,817 --> 01:47:10,816
For what?

1113
01:47:10,857 --> 01:47:12,870
To a fucking kid!

1114
01:47:21,831 --> 01:47:23,834
You didn't think I'd know?

1115
01:47:23,865 --> 01:47:25,815
I wouldn't feel it?

1116
01:47:25,818 --> 01:47:27,848
I knew it from
the very first day

1117
01:47:29,876 --> 01:47:31,866
Because I know you, Connie

1118
01:47:31,869 --> 01:47:34,835
I know you, and I fuckin' hate you!

1119
01:47:34,836 --> 01:47:37,852
I didn't want to kill him.
I wanted to kill you!

1120
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:42,876
Oh, my God

1121
01:47:52,834 --> 01:47:56,827
Edward... Oh, my God

1122
01:48:06,849 --> 01:48:08,872
Dear God

1123
01:48:50,807 --> 01:48:53,870
Mom, look what I did

1124
01:48:55,888 --> 01:48:58,827
Honey... that's ok

1125
01:48:59,827 --> 01:49:00,837
That's ok

1126
01:49:00,878 --> 01:49:02,847
I'm sorry, Mom

1127
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:04,815
It's an accident

1128
01:49:04,855 --> 01:49:06,839
Everybody has accidents

1129
01:49:06,842 --> 01:49:08,898
Why aren't you in bed, Mom?

1130
01:49:11,886 --> 01:49:13,839
I don't know

1131
01:49:17,813 --> 01:49:18,896
Charlie, look at me

1132
01:49:19,857 --> 01:49:21,833
I want you to know...

1133
01:49:21,863 --> 01:49:25,860
that I love you... more
than anything in the worid

1134
01:49:28,814 --> 01:49:31,841
And I want you to know
that your daddy and me both...

1135
01:49:31,855 --> 01:49:34,824
will always, always love you

1136
01:49:34,835 --> 01:49:37,815
No matter what, hmm?

1137
01:49:39,886 --> 01:49:42,832
- Ok?
- Ok

1138
01:49:43,813 --> 01:49:44,852
Come on, sweetie

1139
01:49:44,853 --> 01:49:48,895
Let's go fix up your bed
all nice and fresh, ok?

1140
01:49:49,877 --> 01:49:51,850
All right

1141
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:31,860
>If you find this DO NOT OPEN
until our 25th anniversary

1142
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:48,820
to my beautiful wife
the best part of every day

1143
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:05,836
"You can come on up
and clean it off, no?"

1144
01:53:05,847 --> 01:53:09,877
"Come on! I'm not an
ax murderer. I promise"

1145
01:53:44,847 --> 01:53:45,874
"Thank you"

1146
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:14,897
What are we gonna do?

1147
01:54:18,814 --> 01:54:20,821
I'm so scared

1148
01:54:22,841 --> 01:54:24,851
I'll turn myself in

1149
01:54:24,882 --> 01:54:26,818
No

1150
01:54:28,889 --> 01:54:30,858
No

1151
01:54:39,877 --> 01:54:42,836
No, we can get through this

1152
01:54:43,887 --> 01:54:46,884
We'll take it one day at a time

1153
01:54:48,834 --> 01:54:50,848
No one will know

1154
01:54:52,828 --> 01:54:54,818
We'll know

1155
01:55:02,849 --> 01:55:06,805
31, 3.500, 3.800, 4.000...

1156
01:55:06,816 --> 01:55:08,825
42, 45, 4.800...

1157
01:56:35,829 --> 01:56:37,842
We could disappear

1158
01:56:39,862 --> 01:56:42,822
We could raise some
money, sell everything...

1159
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:44,862
and just leave the country

1160
01:56:45,883 --> 01:56:47,866
"Seٌorita"

1161
01:56:48,877 --> 01:56:50,876
Mexico

1162
01:56:52,827 --> 01:56:53,893
Why not?

1163
01:56:55,875 --> 01:56:57,895
We could get a little
house on the beach...

1164
01:56:58,845 --> 01:57:00,865
Take a different name...

1165
01:57:01,885 --> 01:57:04,820
People do it all the time

1166
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:06,890
What do we tell Charlie?

1167
01:57:08,870 --> 01:57:11,870
Tell him it's an adventure

1168
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:16,880
We could fish all day

1169
01:57:20,835 --> 01:57:23,840
We could learn to play the guitar...

1170
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:29,845
And I would serenade
you to sleep every night

1171
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:33,830
We'd just live the rest of
our lives on that beach...

1172
01:57:34,820 --> 01:57:38,815
and then when we die, we
could just push out to sea

1173
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:40,810
What do you think?

1174
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:44,815
It sounds perfect
