<i>This man is worth $500,</i>

00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:40,916
<i>and this man's<br/>going to collect.</i>

4
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:41,950
<i>He's Jake Cahill,</i>

5
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,452
<i>and he lives by...</i>

6
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:45,286
Bounty Law.

7
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:48,090
You don't ever bring them in<br/>alive, do you, Jake?

8
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:50,593
Not when there's three of them<br/>and one of me.

9
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,299
What are you looking at,<br/>bounty killer?

10
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,800
I'm looking<br/>at an ugly owl-hoot

11
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,803
about to get his jaw busted.

12
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,005
Amateurs try<br/>and take men in alive.

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,242
Amateurs usually<br/>don't make it.

14
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:10,245
<i>Whether you're dead or alive,</i>

15
00:01:10,377 --> 00:01:13,948
<i>you're just a dollar sign</i><br/><i>to Jake Cahill on</i> Bounty Law.

16
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:16,651
<i>Thursdays at 8:30,<br/>only on NBC.</i>

17
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:22,023
Hello, everybody.

18
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:23,325
This is Allen Kincade

19
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:25,359
on the set<br/>of the exciting hit NBC

20
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:27,863
and Screen Gems television<br/>series <i>Bounty Law.</i>

21
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:29,798
Now, if you think<br/>you're seeing double,

22
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:31,433
don't adjust<br/>your television sets

23
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,635
because, well,<br/>in a way, you are.

24
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:35,603
To my right<br/>is <i>Bounty Law</i> series lead

25
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:37,939
and Jake Cahill himself,<br/>Rick Dalton.

26
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:40,842
And to my left is Rick's<br/>stunt double, Cliff Booth.

27
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,710
Welcome and thanks for<br/>taking the time

28
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:45,179
- to visit with us.<br/>- It's our pleasure, Allen.

29
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:47,082
So, Rick,<br/>explain to the audience

30
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:49,552
exactly what it is<br/>a stunt double does.

31
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:52,019
Well...

32
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:55,157
actors are required to do<br/>a lot of dangerous stuff.

33
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,225
Say Jake Cahill<br/>gets shot off his horse.

34
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,561
Now, can I fall off<br/>a horse?

35
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:03,364
Yes, I can,<br/>and, yes, I have.

36
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:09,638
But say I fall off wrong<br/>and I sprain my wrist

37
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,206
or I... or I<br/>twist my ankle.

38
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,341
Now, that can put<br/>an undue burden on production

39
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:16,544
because now maybe<br/>I can't work for a week.

40
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,381
So Cliff here is meant to help<br/>carry the load.

41
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,883
Is that how you'd describe<br/>your job, Cliff?

42
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,119
What, carrying his load?<br/>Yeah, that's about right.

43
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:32,026
Join me next week on the set<br/>of <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show,</i>

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,996
where I'll be talking<br/>to comical cutups,

45
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,730
Morey Amsterdam<br/>and Rose Marie.

46
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:39,100
Till then, this is Allen Kincade<br/>signing off from Hollywood.

47
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,812
Hi. I missed you.

48
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:03,885
The black one.<br/>And the flowers.

49
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:05,352
Flowers, Ava, flowers.

50
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:06,855
And there's the small one.

51
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:08,288
Can I see your tickets?

52
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:10,859
Oh, good boy.

53
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,887
Gina, Gina, Gina.

54
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,689
The face<br/>in the misty light.

55
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:17,758
- Hello, Mr. Schwarz.<br/>- Hello, Gina.

56
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:21,897
I, uh... I have a meeting<br/>with a very handsome cowboy man.

57
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:24,031
He's waiting<br/>for you in the bar.

58
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:25,632
Ah.

59
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,269
Well...

60
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,137
since I just finished<br/>watching

61
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:31,438
a Rick Dalton<br/>fucking film festival,

62
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:34,241
I think I know who you are.<br/>Put it there.

63
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,810
Well, it's my pleasure,<br/>Mr. Schwartz.

64
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,745
And thank you<br/>for taking an interest.

65
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,415
<i>Schwarz,</i> not Schwartz.

66
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,385
Ah. G-goddamn it to hell.<br/>I'm-I'm sorry about that.

67
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,587
- It's my pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.<br/>- Call me Marvin.

68
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,288
Marvin, call me Rick.

69
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:49,725
- Rick?<br/>- Yeah.

70
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:51,860
- Oh, is that your son?<br/>- My son?

71
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,396
No, that's my stunt double,<br/>Cliff Booth. Yeah.

72
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,296
- Good to meet you.<br/>- We've worked together

73
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,298
since the last two seasons<br/>of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

74
00:05:58,433 --> 00:05:59,634
- Yeah?<br/>- My car's in the shop,

75
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,069
so he gave me a ride.

76
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:02,771
<i>That's a big fucking lie.</i>

77
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,738
<i>Rick got his driver's license<br/>taken away</i>

78
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:06,442
<i>for too many<br/>drunk-driving tickets.</i>

79
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,010
<i>Cliff drives him<br/>everywhere now.</i>

80
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:09,276
Oh, fuck.

81
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,879
Well, sounds<br/>like a good friend.

82
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,947
- I try.<br/>- Mm.

83
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,716
I wanna send you greetings<br/>from my wife,

84
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:17,752
Mary Alice <i>Schwarz.</i>

85
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:20,288
Oh, well, that's nice.

86
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,759
Thanks a lot.

87
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:28,863
We had a Rick Dalton<br/>double feature

88
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:30,665
in our screening room<br/>last night.

89
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:34,969
Oh, well, that's both<br/>flattering and-and embarrassing.

90
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,672
What'd you see?

91
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:39,674
Thirty-five mm prints<br/>of <i>Tanner</i>

92
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:42,110
and <i>The Fourteen Fists</i><br/><i>of McCluskey.</i>

93
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:51,586
I hope the, uh,<br/>Rick Dalton double feature

94
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:54,822
wasn't too painful for you<br/>and the... And the missus.

95
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:58,960
Oh, no. "Painful." Stop.<br/>What are you saying?

96
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:02,130
<i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.</i>

97
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:04,132
<i>Our whole courtship,<br/>we watched Westerns.</i>

98
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:05,866
- Here you go.<br/>- Thanks.

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,136
<i>And we thoroughly<br/>enjoyed</i> Tanner.

00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:27,689
- What a picture.<br/>- Good picture, yeah.

107
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,591
That is so much fun.

108
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:30,724
All the shooting.

109
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:36,430
I love that stuff.<br/>You know, the killing.

110
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:38,532
A lot of killing.<br/>Lot of killing, yeah.

111
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,370
Now, gentlemen,<br/>the plan is, we reverse our forces

112
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:45,474
<i>und</i> drive the Allies<br/>back into the sea!

113
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,543
Genius.

114
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:51,312
Panzer divisions come in,

115
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:53,981
and we drive them here<br/>to the ocean.

116
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:55,483
They'll be up against<br/>the wall.

117
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:57,685
- They will have nowhere to go.<br/>- Yes.

118
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,022
This is the spot...

119
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:02,389
Hermann!

120
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,427
Open the curtains.

121
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:28,248
Anybody order<br/>fried sauerkraut?

122
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:48,569
Burn, you Nazi bastards!<br/>Ha-ha-ha!

123
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:52,574
That's you operating<br/>the flamethrower, isn't it?

124
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,608
Oh, you bet your sweet ass<br/>it was. Yeah.

125
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,511
- It was you?<br/>- Yeah. And let me tell you,

126
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:58,680
that-that's one shit-fuck<br/>crazy weapon

127
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:00,982
y-y-you do not wanna be<br/>on the wrong side of.

128
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:02,484
Boy, oh, boy.

129
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:05,386
You know, I practiced<br/>with that dragon, uh,

130
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,288
three hours a day<br/>for two weeks.

131
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,156
Not just because<br/>I wanted to look good

132
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,892
in the picture,<br/>but because I was...

133
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,127
I was shit-scared<br/>of the thing, to be honest.

134
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:15,662
Mike fucking Lewis!

135
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,330
Crisping them Nazis<br/>to hell!

136
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:18,999
Oh, shit, that's...

137
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:20,634
All right,<br/>that's too hot.

138
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,769
Anything we can do<br/>about that heat?

139
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:25,506
- Rick, it's a flamethrower.<br/>- Yeah.

140
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:28,843
So I came to the office<br/>early today,

141
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:34,516
and I watched two episodes<br/>of <i>Bounty Law</i> on 16 mm.

142
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:36,349
Jody Janice,

143
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,853
wanted for cattle rustling<br/>in the state of Wyoming,

144
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:42,190
$425 dead or alive.

145
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,793
And you brought him here<br/>to collect.

146
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:48,529
I don't even know<br/>where here is.

147
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:50,731
It was just<br/>the closest place.

148
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:53,667
Caught up with him about<br/>five miles outside of town.

149
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,736
So, bounty killer,

150
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:59,240
the name of this town<br/>is Janicetown.

151
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,310
And that boy you killed...

152
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:06,680
was Jody Janice.

153
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:10,851
He was the baby boy<br/>of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

154
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:12,786
Hmm.

155
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:16,791
Who's<br/>Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

156
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:22,329
Well, I'll be sure<br/>and introduce you

157
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,565
when he gets here.

00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,072
Did a, ahem,<br/>Ron Ely <i>Tarzan.</i>

173
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:40,108
I did a <i>Land of the Giants.</i><br/><i>Green Hornet.</i>

174
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,110
I did that show, uh...

175
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,512
<i>Bingo Martin</i> with that kid<br/>Scott Brown. Yeah.

176
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:48,916
And I got a <i>F.B.I.</i><br/>that-that airs this Sunday.

177
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,620
You, um... You always play<br/>the bad guy on these shows?

178
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:55,455
- Y-yeah. Mm-hm.<br/>- Yeah.

179
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,358
So, and they have a fight scene<br/>at the end of them?

180
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,127
Well, not... Not...

181
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,530
Not <i>Land of the Giants</i><br/>or <i>F.B.I.,</i>

182
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:05,599
- but the rest, yeah. Yeah.<br/>- And you lose in the fight?

183
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:09,404
Yeah. Yeah, of course.<br/>I'm... I'm the heavy.

184
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:13,675
Oh, that's an old trick<br/>pulled by the networks.

185
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:15,676
Now, you take <i>Bingo Martin,</i><br/>for example.

186
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,310
- Mm-hm.<br/>- Right?

187
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,315
So you got a new guy<br/>like Scott Brown.

188
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,483
You wanna build up<br/>his bona fides, right?

189
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,820
So you hire a guy<br/>from a canceled show

190
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,488
- to play the heavy.<br/>- Hmm.

191
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,757
Then at the end of the show,<br/>when they fight,

192
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:32,694
it's hero besting heavy.

193
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:35,329
But what the audience sees

194
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:40,334
is Bingo Martin<br/>whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

195
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,002
- Uh-huh.<br/>- You see?

196
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,406
Then next week,<br/>it's Ron Ely.

197
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:48,876
And next week,<br/>it's Bob Conrad,

198
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,912
wearing his tight pants,<br/>kicking your ass.

199
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:54,315
Yeah.

200
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:56,983
Now, in another couple of years,<br/>playing punching bag

201
00:12:57,118 --> 00:13:00,188
to every swinging dick<br/>new to the network,

202
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,322
that's gonna have<br/>a psychological effect

203
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:05,859
on how the audience<br/>perceives you.

204
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,427
Right.

205
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,397
So, Rick,

206
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,334
who's gonna kick the shit<br/>out of you next week?

207
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:15,403
Mannix?<br/>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

208
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:17,470
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

209
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:19,807
How about<br/>Batman and Robin?

210
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,541
Ping. Pow.

211
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,545
Choom. Zoom.

212
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:26,915
Down goes you.

213
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,551
Down goes your career<br/>as a leading man.

214
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:38,325
Or do you go to Rome<br/>and star in Westerns

215
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,329
and win fucking fights?

216
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,403
Ticket, señor?

217
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,147
All right,<br/>what's the matter, partner?

218
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,616
Well...

219
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:05,285
it's official, old buddy.<br/>I'm a has-been.

220
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,988
What are you talking about?<br/>What did that guy tell you?

221
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:10,458
He told me the goddamn truth,<br/>is what he told me.

222
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,762
- Oh. Whoa.<br/>- Oh, shit.

223
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,564
- Hey.<br/>- I'm sorry about that.

224
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:17,565
Sorry about that.

225
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,367
Here. Put these on.

226
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:21,068
Don't cry<br/>in front of the Mexicans.

227
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:23,971
- Son of a bitch.<br/>- What's got you so upset, man?

228
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:26,373
Well, if coming face-to-face<br/>with the failure

229
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:28,575
that is your career<br/>ain't worth crying about,

230
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,310
then I don't know<br/>what the fuck is.

231
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:32,379
Right. That guy in there<br/>turn you down?

232
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:35,483
No. He wants to help me<br/>get into Italian movies.

233
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:37,318
Then what's the problem?

234
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,119
I gotta do<br/>Italian goddamn movies!

235
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,954
- That's the fucking problem!<br/>- Come on.

236
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,059
Fucking bullshit! It doesn't<br/>matter whether I cry in public.

237
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:46,360
Nobody remembers<br/>who the fuck I am anyway, huh?

238
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:48,362
<i>...at the Hall of Justice here.</i>

239
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:50,965
<i>The defense will try<br/>to prove the killing of Kennedy</i>

240
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,834
- <i>was the product of a sick mind.</i><br/>- Fuck!

241
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:55,502
- Thank you. Hey, let's go.<br/>- Take me home, Cliff.

242
00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:57,272
Come on, take me home.

243
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:59,374

Ten years of-of-of<br/>treading water.

270
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:19,219
And now a race<br/>to the bottom. Heh.

271
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,555
Look, I never had much<br/>of a career to speak of,

272
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,825
so I can't say I really know<br/>how you feel.

273
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,328
What are you talking about?<br/>You're my stunt double.

274
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,930
Come on, now. Shit.

275
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:32,433
Rick, I'm your driver, man.<br/>I'm-I'm your gofer.

276
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:35,103
I'm not complaining, man.<br/>I like driving you around.

277
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:36,870
I like doing shit<br/>around the house

278
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:38,839
and house-sitting<br/>in the Hollywood Hills

279
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:41,275
when you're gone.

280
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:43,210
But I haven't been<br/>a full-time stuntman

281
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:44,911
for a while now,

282
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,680
and from where I'm standing,

283
00:16:46,814 --> 00:16:48,916
going to Rome to star<br/>in movies does not sound

284
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,886
like the fate worse than death<br/>that you seem to think it is.

285
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:56,222
Come on, now. You ever seen<br/>an-an Italian Western, huh?

286
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:58,425
They're awful.<br/>It's a fucking farce.

287
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,060
Yeah, how many you seen?<br/>One? Two?

288
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:04,265
I've seen enough, all right?<br/>Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.

289
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,991
Oh, hell, man,<br/>stay in L.A.

290
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,691
Give it what fer<br/>next pilot season.

291
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:06,960
Nah, nah. I'm... I'm...

292
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:10,198
I'm too insecure now<br/>to score come pilot season.

293
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:13,168
Screen Gems ain't gonna have<br/>nothing good to say about me.

294
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,202
- You know that.<br/>- Shit. You made <i>Bounty Law.</i>

295
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,537
Nobody's gonna forgive me<br/>for that last season.

296
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:19,073
- No matter what I do...<br/>- Ah...

297
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:21,007
...I'm always gonna be<br/>the horse's ass

298
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,743
that got <i>Bounty Law</i> canceled

299
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:26,646
because I wanted some fucking<br/>rinky-dink movie career.

300
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:31,117
- Tom. My friend.<br/>- I met him?

301
00:18:31,251 --> 00:18:32,519
No, you haven't met him.

302
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:34,488
You won't meet him<br/>because I don't think

303
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:35,523
- you'd like him.<br/>- Why?

304
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:37,157
Well...

305
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:42,863
- Don't even joke.<br/>- A joke? But they're scared.

306
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:58,045
Holy shit. Heh.

307
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,581
That was Polanski.

308
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:02,216
That was Roman Polanski.

309
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:04,584
He's lived there<br/>for a month now.

310
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:07,087
First time I seen him.<br/>Ha-ha-ha.

311
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,190
Holy shit. Goddamn it.

312
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:13,427
What do I always say?

313
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:15,263
Most important thing<br/>in this town is,

314
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,731
when you're making money,<br/>you buy a house in town.

315
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:20,433
You don't rent.<br/>Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

316
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,636
Hollywood real estate<br/>means you live here.

317
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,172
You're not just visiting,<br/>not just passing through.

318
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:28,342
You fucking live here.

319
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,044
Here I am flat<br/>on my ass,

320
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:32,213
and who I got living<br/>next door to me?

321
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:35,214
The director of <i>Rosemary's</i><br/>fucking <i>Baby,</i> that's who.

322
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,617
Polanski, the hottest director<br/>in town right now,

323
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:39,018
probably the world.

324
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:41,122
He's my next-door neighbor.

325
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:44,190
I mean, shit. I mean,<br/>who knows what could happen?

326
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:46,861
I could... I could be<br/>one pool party away

327
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:48,896
f-from starring<br/>in a new Polanski movie.

328
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:50,363
So you're feeling better<br/>now?

329
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:52,266
Aw, yeah, yeah.<br/>Sorry about all that.

330
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,067
Give me my glasses back.

331
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:56,135
Oh, come get them, fucker.<br/>Come...

332
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:58,471
All right, all right,<br/>Audie Murphy, relax.

333
00:19:58,605 --> 00:20:00,974
- There you go.<br/>- You need me for anything else?

334
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:03,944
Nah, nah, nah. I got a lot<br/>of lines to learn for tomorrow.

335
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:05,278
- Shit. All right.<br/>- All right.

336
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:06,913
I'm gonna get my carcass<br/>on home.

337
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:08,981
- All right.<br/>- All right, 7:15 a.m.

338
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:10,785
- Seven-fifteen.<br/>- Out the door.

339
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,253
- Out the door.<br/>- In the car.

340
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:13,420
All right,<br/>see you then.

341
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:08,627
Hello, coming in. Hello.

342
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:10,630
Hello, darling. Hello.

343
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,934
Mm. Mm.

344
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:14,701
Come here.

345
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,836
Hello, sweetheart.

346
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:20,274
Mm. How was your day?<br/>Hmm?

347
00:23:20,408 --> 00:23:22,176
Wait till you see<br/>what I got for you.

348
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,611
Wait until you see<br/>what I got for you.

349
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:27,714
Look what I got for you.

350
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:29,315
Gonna blow your mind, man.

351
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:35,456
Come here. Come here.

352
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:40,594
Ta, ta, ta. Oh!

353
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:42,022
Was that a whine?

354
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:44,991
What did I tell you<br/>about whining?

355
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:46,493
You whine, you don't eat.

356
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:48,327
I will throw this shit<br/>in the trash.

357
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:49,863
I don't wanna, but I will.

358
00:24:51,297 --> 00:24:52,164
You understand?

359
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:54,867
All right.

360
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:32,773
<i>I waited at<br/>the bar till closing time,</i>

361
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,442
<i>but he never came back.</i>

362
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,844
<i>Okay, Peggy, what happened?</i>

363
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:40,613
<i>I don't know.<br/>Everything was fine.</i>

364
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,382
<i>We had dinner at my house.</i>

365
00:25:42,516 --> 00:25:43,950
<i>And afterwards, you know,</i>

366
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,885
- <i>while I was doing the dishes,</i><br/>- Tsk, tsk.

367
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:48,320
<i>he and Tobey played.</i>

368
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:50,491
<i>And then, at the club,<br/>Gabe was doing great.</i>

369
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:52,726
<i>Then, wham, a sudden change.</i>

370
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,263
<i>You know how musicians are.<br/>They're temperamental cats.</i>

371
00:25:56,396 --> 00:25:58,298
- <i>Who knows what got into him?</i><br/>- Yeah.

372
00:26:04,304 --> 00:26:08,675
<i>Rick Dalton rehearsal<br/>tape starting in five, four,</i>

373
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:11,377
<i>three, two, one.</i>

374
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:15,815
Pepe, get your behind<br/>behind that bar! I got a guest.

375
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,383
<i>Johnny says...</i>

376
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:20,554
<i>Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.</i>

377
00:26:20,688 --> 00:26:21,988
<i>How's the beans?</i>

378
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,157
I've had worse.

379
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:27,326
<i>Johnny says... Spanish.</i>

380
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:28,961
<i>A toast.</i>

381
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:31,463
To my wife<br/>and all my sweethearts.

382
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:34,166
May they never meet.

383
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,803
Señor Madrid,<br/>care to join me at my table

384
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:39,805
where I entertain my guests?

385
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,009
<i>I would be<br/>delighted, Monsieur Dakota.</i>

386
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,381
Take the bottle with you.

387
00:26:47,514 --> 00:26:49,549
<i>And Pepe comes over.</i>

388
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:52,018
Hey, where's that chili pepper<br/>daughter of yours

389
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:53,520
with the fiddle?

390
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,488
<i>She's asleep.</i>

391
00:26:55,622 --> 00:26:57,690
Well, wake her the heck up,<br/>get her down here

392
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,861
with her fiddle and her bow,<br/>and entertain my guests.

393
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,530
<i>Sí, señor,<br/>but please don't hurt her this time,</i>

394
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,631
<i>I beg you.</i>

395
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:06,232
I ain't gonna hurt her.

396
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:08,134
Just want her<br/>to play the fiddle.

397
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:09,869
Fetch her and tell her<br/>I'll give her

398
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,238
a fat $5 gold piece,

399
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:14,274
she play her little chili pepper<br/>heart out.

400
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:17,344
So, Johnny, what else<br/>you heard about me?

401
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:20,246
<i>I heard you're<br/>pushing Lancer pretty hard,</i>

402
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,116
<i>but Lancer has money.</i>

403
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:26,754
<i>At some point, he's gonna hire<br/>some guns and push back.</i>

404
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,257
- Oops, sorry.<br/>- It's okay.

405
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,559
I'll open the door for you.

406
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,294
You look good.

407
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:48,509
I think Steve's<br/>gonna be there too.

408
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:49,610
Oh, yeah.

409
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:05,819
Oh, look. They're here.

410
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,337
Welcome to the Playboy<br/>Mansion, Mr. Polanski.

411
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:26,472
Hey, how are you doing,<br/>baby?

412
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:29,375
Hey! Heh. How are you?

413
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,558
Oh, Cass!

414
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:58,072
Yeah!

415
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:04,879
Yeah, baby!

416
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:10,650
Yeah! Whoo! Whoo!

417
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,060
Oh, yeah.

418
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,863
I'm gonna tell you a story.

419
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:59,733
She was engaged to him.

420
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:08,976
Then she flew<br/>to the UK...

421
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:11,276
to make a film<br/>with him,

422
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:16,950
and broke off her engagement<br/>with him and married him.

423
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:22,088
Then they moved<br/>to Los Angeles,

424
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:24,289
and the three of them

425
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:26,258
have been inseparable.

426
00:31:26,392 --> 00:31:28,629
Really?

427
00:31:30,162 --> 00:31:31,832
What's up?

428
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:36,869
Jay loves Sharon,<br/>that's what's up.

429
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:40,040
- Mm.<br/>- And he knows...

430
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:43,443
as sure as God made<br/>little green apples...

431
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:47,013
that one of these days,<br/>that Polish prick's

432
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:48,448
gonna fuck things up,

433
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:51,818
and when he does,<br/>Jay's gonna be there.

434
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,187
Well, one thing's<br/>for sure.

435
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:55,988
Yeah?

436
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,323
What's that?

437
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,960
Sharon absolutely has a type.

438
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:04,331
Cute, short, talented guys

439
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:07,267
who look<br/>like 12-year-old boys.

440
00:32:07,401 --> 00:32:09,202
Yeah.

441
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,142
I never stood a chance.

442
00:32:53,345 --> 00:32:55,449
Argh. Fuck you,<br/>Dr. Sapirstein.

443
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:41,594
Oh, here we are.

444
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,501
Tell transpo!<br/>Gonna need to move all that out!

445
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:51,137
Just a sec. Hold on, guys.

446
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,138
Go ahead.

447
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,510
You can talk to him.<br/>Just talk to him.

448
00:33:57,643 --> 00:33:59,645
- Get that set in place.<br/>- Hey.

449
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:03,450
Ahem. I think the wind blew<br/>down my TV antenna last night,

450
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,286
so while I piss-fart<br/>around with wardrobe,

451
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,955
you mind going home<br/>and fixing it?

452
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,923
I can. You talk to<br/>the stunt gaffer about me today?

453
00:34:11,056 --> 00:34:13,426
That way I'll know<br/>if I'm working this week or not.

454
00:34:13,558 --> 00:34:15,727
Yeah. Ahem.<br/>I've been meaning to tell you.

455
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:19,965
The guy who gaffs this,<br/>he's best friends with Randy,

456
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,634
the gaffer<br/>from <i>The Green Hornet...</i>

457
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,004
...so there ain't no point.

458
00:34:24,136 --> 00:34:26,506
If you don't need me,<br/>I'll pick you up at wrap.

459
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:28,841
I don't need you. Not today.

460
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:32,812
Go home, fix my antenna,<br/>do whatever. See you at wrap.

461
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:37,550
Hey!

462
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:40,853
You're Rick fucking Dalton.<br/>Don't you forget it.

463
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:52,132
Hey, hey.

464
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:53,565
Hey, buddy,<br/>I'm Rick Dalton.

465
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,234
You know<br/>where I'm supposed to go?

466
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:57,504
They're waiting for you<br/>in the makeup trailer.

467
00:34:57,636 --> 00:34:59,339
Where's the makeup trailer?

468
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:01,542
Straight back the way you came,<br/>hard right.

469
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,549
Oh, my God.

470
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,721
Rick Dalton.

471
00:35:15,855 --> 00:35:17,122
Sam Wanamaker.

472
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:18,724
Hey, Sam.

473
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:19,993
Sorry about the wet hand.

474
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:21,995
Oh, don't worry.<br/>I'm used to it with Yul.

475
00:35:22,127 --> 00:35:24,529
I want you to know,<br/>I'm the one who cast you.

476
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:27,334
And I couldn't be more<br/>delighted you're doing this.

477
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:28,633
Oh, well, thank you, Sam.

478
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:31,204
I... I appreciate it.<br/>It's a good part.

479
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,240
Yeah, it is. Have you met<br/>Jim Stacy, the series lead?

480
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:35,676
Uh, not yet, no. No.

481
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,544
Well, you guys are going<br/>to be dynamite together.

482
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,613
Mm. Mm.

483
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:42,047
Well, it sounds exciting.

484
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,216
- Yeah, lightning in a bottle.<br/>- Mm.

485
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,453
Now, you met Sonya,<br/>makeup and hair?

486
00:35:46,585 --> 00:35:47,752
Hi.

487
00:35:47,886 --> 00:35:49,855
And this is Rebekka,<br/>who does costumes.

488
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:51,390
Hello.

489
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,859
- Hi.<br/>- Howdy.

490
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:54,727
I want a whole<br/>new look for Caleb.

491
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,395
I don't want this<br/>Western costumed

492
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,131
the way they costumed<br/><i>The Big Valley</i>

493
00:35:58,263 --> 00:35:59,966
and <i>Bonanza</i><br/>for the last decade.

494
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,703
I want a zeitgeist flair<br/>to the costumes.

495
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:05,771
I mean,<br/>nothing anachronistic,

496
00:36:05,904 --> 00:36:10,109
but where does 1869<br/>and 1969 meet?

497
00:36:10,243 --> 00:36:12,777
Especially when it comes<br/>to you, Caleb.

498
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:14,247
Mm. Mm.

499
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:16,248
First off,<br/>I want to give him a mustache.

500
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:20,953
A big, droopy,<br/>Zapata-like mustache.

501
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:23,089
Now, about his jacket.

502
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,958
I want to give him<br/>a hippie jacket.

503
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:27,460
Something he could wear<br/>into the London Fog tonight

504
00:36:27,593 --> 00:36:29,562
and look like the hippest guy<br/>in the room.

505
00:36:29,696 --> 00:36:31,864
Far out.<br/>We got a Custer jacket.

506
00:36:31,997 --> 00:36:33,565
Fringes all down the arm.

507
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,468
It's tan now,<br/>but I dye it dark brown,

508
00:36:36,602 --> 00:36:38,571
he could hit the Strip in it<br/>tonight.

509
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:40,672
That's my girl. Heh.

510
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:43,643
- Now, Rick, about your hair.<br/>- What about my hair?

511
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:45,611
I want to go<br/>with a different hairstyle.

512
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,779
Huh. What?

513
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,516
Something<br/>more hippie-ish.

514
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:52,918
You want me<br/>to look like a hippie?

515
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:56,022
Well, think less hippie,<br/>more...

516
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:57,189
Hells Angel!

517
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,761
- Right. Say, Sam...<br/>- Get me the...

518
00:37:01,893 --> 00:37:04,663
Sam. Sam, uh...

519
00:37:04,797 --> 00:37:06,665
if you got me covered up<br/>in all this...

520
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:09,100
this junk, uh,

521
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:11,003
how's the audience<br/>gonna know it's me?

522
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:13,172
I hope they don't.

523
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:14,507
Mm.

524
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,011
I don't want them to see<br/>Jake Cahill.

525
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:21,980
I want them to see Caleb.

526
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,917
I hired you<br/>to be an actor, Rick.

527
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:28,188
Not a TV cowboy.<br/>You're better than that.

528
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,549
<i>I've been meaning to tell<br/>you, the guy who gaffs this,</i>

529
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:45,051
<i>he's best friends<br/>with Randy,</i>

530
00:40:45,183 --> 00:40:46,718
<i>the gaffer</i><br/><i>from</i> The Green Hornet,

531
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:49,188
<i>so there really<br/>ain't no point.</i>

532
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:05,772
Hey, Randy.

533
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,076
Cliff.

534
00:41:10,209 --> 00:41:12,511
So you're still with Rick,<br/>huh?

535
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:13,547
Still here.

536
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:15,915
He in there?

537
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:18,084
Yeah. Just knock.

538
00:41:22,455 --> 00:41:25,257
Look, just put him<br/>in the wardrobe, all right?

539
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,491
What's it gonna hurt?

540
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,227
Then if you need him,<br/>you got him.

541
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,996
But then I gotta have<br/>a conversation

542
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:31,697
with that<br/>wardrobe assistant,

543
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,599
- and, man, she's a fucking bitch.<br/>- I just don't... Please, I...

544
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:37,502
Look, Randy, I'm asking you<br/>to help me out, man.

545
00:41:37,636 --> 00:41:39,339
If the answer's no,<br/>the answer's no,

546
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:41,940
not no with excuses.

547
00:41:42,073 --> 00:41:44,342
Hey, man.

548
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:47,546
This ain't a fucking<br/>Andy McLaglen picture, you know?

549
00:41:47,681 --> 00:41:50,416
I can't afford to hire a bunch<br/>of guys to smoke cigarettes

550
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,585
and sit around talking<br/>to each other all day

551
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,319
on the chance<br/>that I might use them.

552
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:55,955
I got a four-man team here,<br/>Rick.

553
00:41:56,087 --> 00:41:58,423
If I need more than that,<br/>I gotta get it approved.

554
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,993
And, you know,<br/>I gotta look after my dudes.

555
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:03,996
Hey, and if your dudes<br/>were a better match for me,

556
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:05,564
I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"

557
00:42:05,698 --> 00:42:08,267
but-but that's not the case,<br/>and you know it.

558
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,469
- He's a great match for me.<br/>- Yeah, no...

559
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:12,604
Hey, you could do<br/>anything you want to him.

560
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,808
Throw him off a building, right?<br/>Light him on fire.

561
00:42:15,942 --> 00:42:17,744
Hit him with<br/>a fucking Lincoln, right?

562
00:42:17,877 --> 00:42:19,445
Get creative.<br/>Do whatever you want.

563
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,247
He's just happy<br/>for the opportunity.

564
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:23,415
- Rick.<br/>- Yeah?

565
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,486
I don't dig him.

566
00:42:29,122 --> 00:42:32,457
And I don't dig the vibe<br/>he brings on a set.

567
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,228
What, is there some old beef<br/>between the two of you?

568
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:37,629
- Oh, come on, man.<br/>- What? What?

569
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,966
The dude killed<br/>his fucking wife.

570
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:45,238
Come on, man. You don't believe<br/>that old shit, do you?

571
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,972
Yes, Rick, I do.

572
00:42:47,105 --> 00:42:50,142
And I work with my wife,<br/>and she believes it.

573
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,444
She doesn't want<br/>his creepy ass around.

574
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,315
You know, this is probably

575
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,651
the shittiest weather ever.

576
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:01,886
The shittiest weather<br/>on the shittiest boat

577
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,522
with the shittiest person.

578
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:08,827
Natalie, my sister, said,<br/>"He's a loser. He's a loser."

579
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,896
They all said it,<br/>"He's a fucking loser,"

580
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:12,297
and I didn't believe them.

581
00:43:12,431 --> 00:43:15,368
So I guess<br/>I'm the fucking idiot.

582
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,136
And now you're not<br/>gonna talk to me?

583
00:43:17,268 --> 00:43:19,537
What, you don't feel<br/>like fighting?

584
00:43:19,672 --> 00:43:21,307
Well, I feel like<br/>fucking fighting

585
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:23,508
because I've been up here<br/>by myself

586
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:27,213
for four hours on this<br/>fucking shithole of a boat.

587
00:43:27,346 --> 00:43:28,982
Yeah.

588
00:43:31,017 --> 00:43:34,319
H-he's a goddamn<br/>war hero. Fuck.

589
00:43:36,654 --> 00:43:37,857
Yeah, appreciate it.

590
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,167
Okay, you fucking horse's ass.<br/>Let's get you over to wardrobe.

591
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,771
Now, I'll put you<br/>in wardrobe,

592
00:43:51,904 --> 00:43:54,507
but you don't stunt,<br/>I don't pay you.

593
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,544
Appreciate the opportunity,<br/>Randy. I won't let you down.

594
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,345
You know my wife Janet,<br/>don't you?

595
00:44:00,478 --> 00:44:01,846
Yeah.

596
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,183
Steer clear of her.

597
00:44:04,317 --> 00:44:07,520
Now, I admire<br/>Cassius Clay, I do.

598
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:09,889
What I admire is,<br/>in his sport,

599
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,257
there's an element<br/>of true combat.

600
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,927
When Cassius Clay meets<br/>Sonny Liston in the ring,

601
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,263
that's not two athletes<br/>posturing.

602
00:44:17,397 --> 00:44:19,265
That's combat.

603
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:22,567
Two men trying to kill<br/>each other right now.

604
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,736
If you don't beat him...

605
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,939
he kills you.

606
00:44:27,073 --> 00:44:28,674
That's beyond athletics.

607
00:44:28,808 --> 00:44:32,378
That's beyond<br/><i>Wide World of Sports,</i> you know?

608
00:44:32,511 --> 00:44:34,379
That's two warriors<br/>engaged in combat.

609
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:36,949
That's what I admire.

610
00:44:37,082 --> 00:44:38,417
In martial arts tournaments,

611
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,119
they won't let you fight<br/>like that.

612
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:42,254
It's very frustrating.

613
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,689
You stand in front of a guy,

614
00:44:43,823 --> 00:44:46,625
and you just wanna let him<br/>have it. Ha!

615
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:48,294
But you can't.

616
00:44:48,426 --> 00:44:52,363
So you gotta do this<br/>playacting, patty-cake version.

617
00:44:52,497 --> 00:44:55,600
Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston.<br/>Joe Louis.

618
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,803
The colored boxer,

619
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:58,604
not that white<br/>kickboxing asshole.

620
00:44:59,939 --> 00:45:02,642
They do what<br/>they need to do to win.

621
00:45:02,774 --> 00:45:04,676
They unleash<br/>as much punishment

622
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,146
as they have to<br/>to defeat the other guy.

623
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:09,949
But in martial arts<br/>tournaments,

624
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,451
I do to win what<br/>they do to win.

625
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,488
I unleash all my power.

626
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:17,922
I kill people.

627
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:20,160
If you fought Cassius<br/>Clay, who would win?

628
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:22,961
Well,<br/>that would never happen.

629
00:45:23,094 --> 00:45:25,598
But if you did,<br/>what do you think would happen?

630
00:45:26,799 --> 00:45:28,134
I'd make him a cripple.

631
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,272
Hey, you. What's your name?

632
00:45:34,406 --> 00:45:36,809
- Me?<br/>- Yeah, you.

633
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:39,644
My name's Cliff.

634
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,781
I'm Rick Dalton's<br/>stunt double.

635
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:44,517
- Stuntman?<br/>- Yeah.

636
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:47,151
You know,<br/>you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

637
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:49,021
That's what they tell me.

638
00:45:49,154 --> 00:45:53,024
So did I say something<br/>funny, stuntman?

639
00:45:53,158 --> 00:45:56,194
- Yeah, you kind of did.<br/>- What's so funny?

640
00:45:56,328 --> 00:45:58,330
Look, man,<br/>I don't want any trouble.

641
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,864
I'm just here<br/>to do a job.

642
00:45:59,998 --> 00:46:01,801
But you're laughing at<br/>what I'm saying.

643
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:03,468
But I'm not saying<br/>anything funny.

644
00:46:03,602 --> 00:46:05,904
So, what do you think<br/>is so funny?

645
00:46:07,205 --> 00:46:09,341
What I think is...

646
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:14,078
you're a little man<br/>with a big mouth and a big chip,

647
00:46:14,212 --> 00:46:15,915
and I think you<br/>should be embarrassed

648
00:46:16,047 --> 00:46:18,183
to suggest you'd be<br/>anything more than a stain

649
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,086
on the seat<br/>of Cassius Clay's trunks.

650
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:24,055
Brother, you're the one<br/>with the big mouth.

651
00:46:24,189 --> 00:46:25,857
And I would really<br/>enjoy closing it,

652
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,993
especially in front<br/>of all my friends.

653
00:46:29,127 --> 00:46:32,464
But my hands are registered<br/>as lethal weapons.

654
00:46:32,598 --> 00:46:34,866
That means,<br/>we get into a fight,

655
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,903
I accidentally kill you,<br/>I go to jail.

656
00:46:39,038 --> 00:46:40,639
Anybody accidentally<br/>kills anybody

657
00:46:40,772 --> 00:46:42,040
in a fight,<br/>they go to jail.

658
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,576
It's called<br/>manslaughter.

659
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:45,844
And I think all that<br/>"lethal weapon" horseshit

660
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:47,479
is just an excuse<br/>so you dancers

661
00:46:47,613 --> 00:46:49,748
never have to get<br/>in a real fight.

662
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:51,884
Okay.

663
00:46:53,118 --> 00:46:54,921
How about<br/>a friendly contest?

664
00:46:56,154 --> 00:46:58,056
No punching in the face.

665
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,725
Two out of three.

666
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,860
Who puts who<br/>on the ground first?

667
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:06,865
Nobody tries to hurt nobody,<br/>just who ends up on their butt?

668
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:13,138
That's a great idea, Kato.

669
00:47:24,783 --> 00:47:26,785
You know, Bruce,<br/>that guy's kind of famous.

670
00:47:26,919 --> 00:47:28,421
That guy?

671
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:29,921
For what?

672
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,425
Killed his wife<br/>and got away with it.

673
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,693
That guy?

674
00:47:33,826 --> 00:47:35,361
That guy.

675
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:01,286
Not bad, Kato.

676
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,423
Try that again.

677
00:48:45,497 --> 00:48:47,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

678
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,701
What the fuck<br/>is going on here?

679
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:52,939
Hey, jackass,<br/>this is our series lead.

680
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:54,640
What the fuck<br/>are you thinking?

681
00:48:54,772 --> 00:48:56,975
You're right, Janet.<br/>I'm sorry about that.

682
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:59,678
Don't fucking "Janet" me,<br/>you prick.

683
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:02,014
Hey.<br/>What's up, babe?

684
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:05,484
What's up, Randy,<br/>is that your loser asshole,

685
00:49:05,616 --> 00:49:08,821
wife-killing buddy boy here was<br/>beating the shit out of Bruce.

686
00:49:08,953 --> 00:49:10,354
What?

687
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,492
- Hey, Randy.<br/>- Cliff.

688
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:14,360
What the fuck, man?

689
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,930
Let me just say, nobody beat<br/>the shit out of Bruce.

690
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:20,332
It was a friendly contest.<br/>He barely touched me.

691
00:49:20,466 --> 00:49:23,036
I think that dent in the car<br/>says something different.

692
00:49:24,703 --> 00:49:26,906
Oh, my God!

693
00:49:27,038 --> 00:49:29,440
What the fuck<br/>did you do to my car?!

694
00:49:29,575 --> 00:49:31,710
What the fuck<br/>did you do to her car?

695
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,812
I threw this<br/>little prick into it,

696
00:49:33,946 --> 00:49:35,881
but I did not know<br/>it was her car.

697
00:49:36,013 --> 00:49:40,484
Get the wardrobe off,<br/>get your shit, and get fucked!

698
00:49:40,618 --> 00:49:41,553
- Janet!<br/>- What?

699
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,755
I will handle this.

700
00:49:42,888 --> 00:49:44,489
Then fucking handle it,<br/>Randy.

701
00:49:45,991 --> 00:49:46,893
Cliff...

702
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,263
get the wardrobe off,<br/>get your shit,

703
00:49:51,397 --> 00:49:53,099
and get off the lot.

704
00:49:56,134 --> 00:49:57,536
Fair enough.

705
00:50:31,803 --> 00:50:34,238
Aw. What's the matter?

706
00:50:34,372 --> 00:50:38,209
Are you afraid I'll tell<br/>Jim Morrison you were dancing

707
00:50:38,343 --> 00:50:40,645
to Paul Revere<br/>and the Raiders?

708
00:50:40,779 --> 00:50:42,648
Are they not<br/>cool enough for you?

709
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:54,759
Who's this<br/>shaggy asshole?

710
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,796
Hello? Can I help you?

711
00:50:57,928 --> 00:51:00,631
Oh, yeah. Hey, man.<br/>I'm looking for Terry.

712
00:51:00,765 --> 00:51:03,801
I'm a friend of Terry's<br/>and Dennis Wilson's.

713
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,072
Well, Terry and Candy<br/>don't live here anymore.

714
00:51:06,205 --> 00:51:07,806
This is the Polanski<br/>residence now.

715
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,276
Really? He moved?

716
00:51:10,908 --> 00:51:11,810
Dang.

717
00:51:13,145 --> 00:51:14,979
Uh, you know...?<br/>You know where?

718
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:17,382
I'm not sure,<br/>but the owner of the property,

719
00:51:17,517 --> 00:51:20,386
Paul, might.<br/>He's in the guest house.

720
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:21,986
Who is it, Jay?

721
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,557
It's okay, honey.<br/>It's a friend of Terry's.

722
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,792
Yeah, just take<br/>the back path.

723
00:51:27,926 --> 00:51:29,061
Thank you kindly.

724
00:51:31,196 --> 00:51:32,531
Ma'am.

725
00:51:48,413 --> 00:51:50,682
- All right, that's an hour!<br/>- Hey, Rick.

726
00:51:50,815 --> 00:51:52,384
I know they just<br/>broke for lunch,

727
00:51:52,518 --> 00:51:55,220
but you need to wait at least<br/>an hour before you can eat.

728
00:51:55,353 --> 00:51:58,022
- Give that glue a chance to dry.<br/>- Oh, no worries, honey.

729
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:02,460
I got my book. Say, say,<br/>where's the bad-guy saloon?

730
00:52:02,593 --> 00:52:04,696
You just go straight<br/>through the Western town,

731
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,299
take a right and a left,<br/>and you see it right there.

732
00:52:07,433 --> 00:52:10,035
Thanks, honey.

733
00:52:11,404 --> 00:52:13,406
Can we move to number two?

734
00:52:13,538 --> 00:52:15,006
How is his bounce?

735
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,740
Can I get a bounce there?

736
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:19,377
Just grab the crescent<br/>wrench, come right back.

737
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,713
Just make it a quick one.

738
00:52:22,047 --> 00:52:24,584
- Tim!<br/>- Looks great. Right there.

739
00:53:10,261 --> 00:53:11,596
Hello.

740
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:14,834
Hello.

741
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:18,937
Hello.

742
00:53:21,107 --> 00:53:22,306
Would...

743
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,142
Would it bother you<br/>if I sat

744
00:53:24,276 --> 00:53:26,279
next to you<br/>and read my book too?

745
00:53:28,614 --> 00:53:30,149
I don't know.

746
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,151
Would you bother me?

747
00:53:33,285 --> 00:53:34,754
I'll try not to.

748
00:53:38,156 --> 00:53:39,292
Sit.

749
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,304
Ah.

750
00:54:26,538 --> 00:54:30,375
Sorry. Sorry about that.<br/>Ahem.

751
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:36,982
You don't eat lunch?

752
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,518
I've got a scene<br/>after lunch.

753
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,654
Yeah?

754
00:54:43,288 --> 00:54:46,558
Eating lunch before I do<br/>a scene makes me sluggish.

755
00:54:46,692 --> 00:54:48,493
I believe it's the job<br/>of an actor...

756
00:54:48,627 --> 00:54:50,728
And I say "actor,"<br/>not "actress,"

757
00:54:50,863 --> 00:54:53,665
because the word "actress"<br/>is nonsensical.

758
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:56,035
It's the actor's job<br/>to avoid

759
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,202
impediments<br/>to their performance.

760
00:54:58,335 --> 00:55:02,908
It's the actor's job to strive<br/>for 100 percent effectiveness.

761
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,145
Naturally, we never succeed,<br/>but it's the pursuit...

762
00:55:07,946 --> 00:55:09,381
that's meaningful.

763
00:55:10,783 --> 00:55:13,485
- Who are you?<br/>- You can call me Marabella.

764
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:16,520
Mar... Marabella what?

765
00:55:16,654 --> 00:55:18,122
Marabella Lancer.

766
00:55:18,256 --> 00:55:21,526
No, no, come on, come on.<br/>What's your real name?

767
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:25,631
When we're on set,<br/>I'd prefer to only

768
00:55:25,763 --> 00:55:27,698
be referred to<br/>by my character's name.

769
00:55:27,832 --> 00:55:30,935
It helps me invest<br/>in the reality of the story.

770
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:33,238
I've tried it both ways,<br/>and I'm always just

771
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:35,574
a tiny bit better<br/>when I don't break character.

772
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:39,245
And if I can be<br/>a tiny bit better, I want to be.

773
00:55:42,446 --> 00:55:45,417
You're the bad guy.<br/>Caleb DeCoteau.

774
00:55:49,087 --> 00:55:52,391
I thought it was<br/>pronounced Caleb "Dakota."

775
00:55:52,524 --> 00:55:55,627
I'm pretty sure<br/>it's "DeCoteau."

776
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,732
- DeCoteau.<br/>- Mm.

777
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,035
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

778
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:06,605
Hmm.

779
00:56:21,953 --> 00:56:23,288
What are you reading?

780
00:56:24,622 --> 00:56:27,091
It's a biography<br/>on Walt Disney.

781
00:56:27,225 --> 00:56:28,792
It's fascinating.

782
00:56:28,926 --> 00:56:30,762
He's a genius, you know.

783
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:34,265
I mean, a once-in-every-50<br/>-or-100-years kind of genius.

784
00:56:34,399 --> 00:56:36,469
What are you, 12?

785
00:56:37,335 --> 00:56:38,504
I'm 8.

786
00:56:39,404 --> 00:56:41,172
What are you reading?

787
00:56:42,741 --> 00:56:43,976
Just a Western.

788
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,045
What does that mean?<br/>Is it good?

789
00:56:47,178 --> 00:56:50,149
- Pretty good.<br/>- What's the story?

790
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:53,285
I haven't finished<br/>it yet.

791
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:56,520
I didn't ask<br/>for the whole story.

792
00:56:56,654 --> 00:56:58,357
What's the idea<br/>of the story?

793
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:01,259
Well... ahem,

794
00:57:01,393 --> 00:57:04,463
it's about this guy<br/>who's a bronco buster.

795
00:57:05,663 --> 00:57:07,632
It's the story<br/>of his life.

796
00:57:08,966 --> 00:57:10,768
Guy's name<br/>is Tom Breezy,

797
00:57:10,902 --> 00:57:13,939
but everyone always<br/>calls him Easy Breezy.

798
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:16,642
Now, when Easy Breezy<br/>was in his 20s

799
00:57:16,774 --> 00:57:19,777
and-and-and young and<br/>good-looking, he could...

800
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,147
He could break any horse<br/>that you could throw at him.

801
00:57:23,281 --> 00:57:26,183
Back then,<br/>he just had a way.

802
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:29,587
Now he's into<br/>his, uh, late 30s

803
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:32,324
and he takes a bad fall,<br/>and it messes up his hip.

804
00:57:32,457 --> 00:57:34,859
He's not... He's not...<br/>He's not crippled

805
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,328
or anything like that, but...

806
00:57:37,462 --> 00:57:39,431
But he's got<br/>spine problems

807
00:57:39,564 --> 00:57:42,233
he never had before,<br/>and he spends, uh...

808
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:47,404
more of his days in pain<br/>than he ever did before.

809
00:57:47,538 --> 00:57:50,441
Jeepers, this sounds<br/>like a good novel.

810
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,211
Yeah, it's not bad.

811
00:57:54,212 --> 00:57:55,914
Where are you in it?

812
00:57:56,047 --> 00:57:58,250
Mm. About midway.

813
00:57:59,618 --> 00:58:02,821
What's happening<br/>to Easy Breezy now?

814
00:58:02,955 --> 00:58:05,424
Uh, he's, um...<br/>He...

815
00:58:06,825 --> 00:58:08,593
He's not the best<br/>anymore.

816
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,729
In fact,<br/>far from it. And...

817
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:17,569
he's coming to terms with what<br/>it's like to be slightly more...

818
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:21,906
use...

819
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:33,953
Slightly more useless<br/>each day.

820
00:58:49,433 --> 00:58:51,303
I-it's okay, Caleb.

821
00:58:51,435 --> 00:58:52,970
It's okay.

822
00:58:53,105 --> 00:58:55,540
It sounds like<br/>a really sad book.

823
00:58:55,672 --> 00:58:57,575
Poor Easy Breezy.

824
00:58:57,709 --> 00:59:00,145
I'm practically crying,<br/>and I haven't even read it.

825
00:59:02,214 --> 00:59:04,116
About 15 years,<br/>you'll be living it.

826
00:59:04,248 --> 00:59:05,551
What?

827
00:59:08,919 --> 00:59:11,656
Nothing, pumpkin puss.<br/>I'm just...

828
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:14,158
I'm just teasing you.

829
00:59:15,527 --> 00:59:17,329
You know something? You...

830
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,498
You might be right<br/>about this book.

831
00:59:21,632 --> 00:59:24,837
I think it hits harder<br/>than I gave it credit for.

832
00:59:26,672 --> 00:59:29,975
I don't like names<br/>like "pumpkin puss,"

833
00:59:30,975 --> 00:59:32,943
but since you're upset,

834
00:59:33,078 --> 00:59:35,014
we'll talk about that<br/>some other time.

835
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:32,036
I'm only going as far<br/>as Westwood Village.

836
01:00:32,169 --> 01:00:33,837
Hey, beggars<br/>can't be choosers.

837
01:00:33,971 --> 01:00:34,872
- Come on in.<br/>- Thanks.

838
01:00:55,493 --> 01:00:57,129
- Thank you so much.<br/>- My pleasure.

839
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,332
- Good luck on your adventure.<br/>- Thank you.

840
01:01:00,464 --> 01:01:02,834
- Have a good time in Big Sur.<br/>- Thank you so much.

841
01:01:02,966 --> 01:01:04,169
- Take care.<br/>- You too.

842
01:02:10,569 --> 01:02:13,105
- Oh, hey.<br/>- Hello.

843
01:02:13,238 --> 01:02:15,806
How can I help you,<br/>young lady?

844
01:02:15,939 --> 01:02:18,175
Oh.

845
01:02:18,308 --> 01:02:20,011
I'm here to pick up<br/>a first edition

846
01:02:20,145 --> 01:02:22,681
of Thomas Hardy's <i>Tess</i><br/><i>of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.

847
01:02:22,814 --> 01:02:23,980
It's under Polanski.

848
01:02:24,114 --> 01:02:25,850
Yeah, you're talking books<br/>there, kid.

849
01:02:25,984 --> 01:02:27,352
Oh, I know.<br/>Isn't it wonderful?

850
01:02:27,484 --> 01:02:29,353
- Yeah. Oh, man.<br/>- I just read it.

851
01:02:29,488 --> 01:02:31,823
- I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.<br/>- Mm.

852
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:37,127
- Rick Dalton?<br/>- You bet.

853
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:39,797
Jim Stacy. This is my show.<br/>Welcome aboard.

854
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:41,665
We're real glad<br/>to have a pro like you

855
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,200
playing the heavy<br/>on the pilot.

856
01:02:43,334 --> 01:02:45,703
And I gotta tell you,<br/>I came damn close

857
01:02:45,837 --> 01:02:48,506
to being in <i>The Fourteen</i><br/><i>Fists of McCluskey.</i>

858
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,808
- No kidding.<br/>- Yeah.

859
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,509
Let me tell you, I...

860
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,845
I just got my part-part<br/>by sheer luck.

861
01:02:53,977 --> 01:02:55,645
Up until two weeks<br/>before shooting,

862
01:02:55,779 --> 01:02:57,415
Fabian was in the part.

863
01:02:57,549 --> 01:03:00,152
Then-then he breaks his shoulder<br/>doing a <i>Virginian.</i>

864
01:03:00,285 --> 01:03:01,486
That's how I got it, so...

865
01:03:01,618 --> 01:03:02,520
Ah.

866
01:03:04,256 --> 01:03:07,859
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you<br/>something I heard about.

867
01:03:07,991 --> 01:03:09,194
Was it true<br/>you almost got

868
01:03:09,326 --> 01:03:11,029
the McQueen part<br/>in <i>The Great Escape?</i>

869
01:03:12,698 --> 01:03:15,700
- Hilts, isn't it?<br/>- Captain Hilts, actually.

870
01:03:15,832 --> 01:03:17,634
- Seventeen escape attempts.<br/>- Eighteen.

871
01:03:17,768 --> 01:03:20,370
Never had an audition.<br/>Never had a meeting.

872
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:21,806
Never met John Sturges.

873
01:03:21,939 --> 01:03:24,474
So, no, I don't think<br/>you could say I...

874
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:26,578
I almost got the part, but...

875
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:29,013
- Tunnel man, engineer.<br/>- Flier.

876
01:03:29,147 --> 01:03:31,415
I suppose what's called in<br/>the American Army,

877
01:03:31,549 --> 01:03:33,418
a hotshot pilot.

878
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:37,622
But the story goes,<br/>for a brief moment,

879
01:03:37,756 --> 01:03:40,558
McQueen almost passed<br/>on the movie,

880
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,193
and during that<br/>brief moment,

881
01:03:42,326 --> 01:03:44,529
I, apparently,<br/>was on a list of four.

882
01:03:44,661 --> 01:03:45,763
You have other plans?

883
01:03:45,897 --> 01:03:47,098
I haven't seen Berlin yet

884
01:03:47,232 --> 01:03:48,700
from the ground<br/>or from the air,

885
01:03:48,832 --> 01:03:51,035
and I plan on doing both<br/>before the war's over.

886
01:03:51,169 --> 01:03:52,569
You and who?

887
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,873
- Me and... Me and three Georges.<br/>- Which three Georges?

888
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:57,475
Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

889
01:03:57,609 --> 01:03:59,110
- Oh, man.<br/>- Yeah.

890
01:03:59,243 --> 01:04:00,478
That's gotta hurt.

891
01:04:00,611 --> 01:04:02,646
Yeah, well,<br/>I didn't get it,

892
01:04:02,779 --> 01:04:04,082
McQueen did it,

893
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:06,585
and, frankly,<br/>I never had a chance.

894
01:04:08,152 --> 01:04:10,855
Ten days isolation,<br/>Hilts.

895
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:12,057
Captain Hilts.

896
01:04:12,189 --> 01:04:13,958
Twenty days.

897
01:04:14,091 --> 01:04:15,026
Right.

898
01:04:16,361 --> 01:04:19,196
Oh, you'll still be here<br/>when I get out?

899
01:04:20,564 --> 01:04:22,200
Cooler.

900
01:05:17,388 --> 01:05:20,124
- One, please.<br/>- Seventy-five cents.

901
01:05:22,993 --> 01:05:25,462
What if I'm in the movie?

902
01:05:25,596 --> 01:05:27,165
What do you mean?

903
01:05:27,297 --> 01:05:29,868
I mean, I'm in the movie.

904
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,468
I'm Sharon Tate.

905
01:05:31,602 --> 01:05:34,038
- You're in this?<br/>- Mm-hm.

906
01:05:34,172 --> 01:05:36,308
I play Miss Carlson, the klutz.

907
01:05:37,741 --> 01:05:38,776
That's me.

908
01:05:40,544 --> 01:05:43,214
But that's the girl<br/>from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

909
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:48,886
Well, that's me, the girl<br/>from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

910
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,655
Really?

911
01:05:50,788 --> 01:05:52,056
Really.

912
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:56,894
Hey, Rubin!<br/>Come out here.

913
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:02,868
This is the girl<br/>from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

914
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,035
- Patty Duke?<br/>- No, the other one.

915
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:07,339
- The girl from <i>Peyton Place?</i><br/>- No, the other one.

916
01:06:07,471 --> 01:06:09,774
The one who ends up<br/>doing dirty movies.

917
01:06:09,906 --> 01:06:12,809
- Oh.<br/>- She's in this movie.

918
01:06:12,944 --> 01:06:14,512
- Oh.<br/>- Sharon Tate.

919
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:18,015
Well, welcome<br/>to the Bruin, Miss Tate.

920
01:06:18,149 --> 01:06:19,749
Thank you for coming<br/>to our theater.

921
01:06:19,884 --> 01:06:21,886
Would you like to come in<br/>and see the show?

922
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:22,887
Could I?

923
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,221
By all means.

924
01:06:25,223 --> 01:06:26,158
Thank you.

925
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:30,027
Hey, can I get<br/>a picture?

926
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,061
Oh, sure.

927
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,096
Okay.

928
01:06:36,366 --> 01:06:38,702
You know, why don't you<br/>stand over by the poster

929
01:06:38,837 --> 01:06:40,772
so people will know<br/>who you are.

930
01:06:40,904 --> 01:06:43,140
Okay. Could you?

931
01:06:55,853 --> 01:06:57,321
Would you like<br/>some refreshments?

932
01:06:57,455 --> 01:07:00,092
- Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.<br/>- Enjoy the show.

933
01:07:36,294 --> 01:07:38,629
<i>Can I ask<br/>you a personal question?</i>

934
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,998
- <i>I wish you would.</i><br/>- <i>How did a nice boy</i>

935
01:07:41,131 --> 01:07:43,967
<i>like you get involved<br/>with a group like the Heads?</i>

936
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,969
<i>I turned to them<br/>after I was rejected</i>

937
01:07:46,102 --> 01:07:48,172
<i>by the Daughters<br/>of the American Revolution.</i>

938
01:08:10,627 --> 01:08:12,396
<i>Very pleasant hotel here.</i>

939
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,166
- <i>Mr. Helm?</i><br/>- <i>Yes?</i>

940
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,367
<i>Oh!</i>

941
01:08:20,272 --> 01:08:21,706
<i>I'm Freya.</i>

942
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,175
<i>Welcome to Denmark,<br/>Mr. Helm.</i>

943
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:28,012
<i>These are for you. Street maps,<br/>places of interest.</i>

944
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,479
<i>This is for you too.</i>

945
01:08:31,248 --> 01:08:32,983
- <i>What year was that?</i><br/>- <i>1949.</i>

946
01:08:33,117 --> 01:08:34,785
<i>That's a very good year.</i>

947
01:08:34,919 --> 01:08:36,621
<i>I'm here to<br/>help any way I can.</i>

948
01:08:36,754 --> 01:08:37,622
<i>Very nice of you.</i>

949
01:08:37,755 --> 01:08:38,622
<i>Is there anything</i>

950
01:08:38,755 --> 01:08:40,024
<i>you'd like me to do?</i>

951
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:42,125
- <i>Yes, a couple things.</i><br/>- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

952
01:08:42,259 --> 01:08:45,563
<i>Would you mind getting off<br/>my camera case, please?</i>

953
01:08:45,697 --> 01:08:47,332
- <i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i><br/>- <i>Oh, that's all right.</i>

954
01:08:47,465 --> 01:08:49,500
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i><br/>- <i>That's okay.</i>

955
01:08:49,632 --> 01:08:50,602
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

956
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:53,670
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

957
01:09:02,246 --> 01:09:05,248
<i>This is some kind of hotel<br/>you've got here.</i>

958
01:09:07,551 --> 01:09:09,620
<i>Half a bottle<br/>is better than none.</i>

959
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:21,098
Morning, partner.

960
01:09:21,232 --> 01:09:23,602
Probably come<br/>by to see you later.

961
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:59,470
That's far enough,<br/>jughead.

962
01:10:00,304 --> 01:10:01,806
Name's not jughead.

963
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,343
What you doing<br/>around here, boy?

964
01:10:05,475 --> 01:10:08,411
I'm thirsty. That's a saloon,<br/>ain't it?

965
01:10:08,545 --> 01:10:11,614
Oh, yeah,<br/>that's a saloon.

966
01:10:11,748 --> 01:10:14,286
- Only you can't come in.<br/>- Mr. Gilbert.

967
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,624
Don't let me stop you<br/>from earning your money.

968
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:23,827
I know how bored<br/>and restless you get

969
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:25,930
when you run out of tamales.

970
01:10:27,732 --> 01:10:29,934
But, Mr. Gilbert,<br/>if I was you,

971
01:10:31,402 --> 01:10:33,904
I'd find out that<br/>jughead's name.

972
01:10:35,372 --> 01:10:38,009
Allow me to introduce<br/>the two of you.

973
01:10:39,743 --> 01:10:41,645
This here is Bob Gilbert.

974
01:10:42,813 --> 01:10:44,516
The Businessman?

975
01:10:44,648 --> 01:10:46,416
That's right.

976
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:50,888
Business Bob Gilbert.<br/>And who might he be, Caleb?

977
01:10:51,022 --> 01:10:54,225
Well,<br/>that's a fella by the name of Madrid.

978
01:10:55,093 --> 01:10:56,493
Johnny Madrid.

979
01:10:57,495 --> 01:10:59,397
Who's Johnny Madrid?

980
01:11:05,635 --> 01:11:07,304
He ain't from round here.

981
01:11:07,438 --> 01:11:09,473
No, really.

982
01:11:09,605 --> 01:11:10,675
Who is he, Caleb?

983
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:17,215
Oh, you're about<br/>to find out...

984
01:11:19,017 --> 01:11:20,050
Businessman.

985
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:40,739
Ready when you are,<br/>Gilbert.

986
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,949
Johnny Madrid.

987
01:12:29,853 --> 01:12:31,623
How long has it been?

988
01:12:31,755 --> 01:12:35,225
Since that time in<br/>Juárez, about three years ago.

989
01:12:35,358 --> 01:12:38,696
Well, come on in<br/>and have a drink.

990
01:12:38,828 --> 01:12:41,198
Hell, in that case...

991
01:12:43,334 --> 01:12:45,603
buy you a drink, Caleb?

992
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:46,805
Sure, Johnny.

993
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,808
How about some mezcal?

994
01:12:50,942 --> 01:12:52,777
Like that time in Juárez.

995
01:12:54,444 --> 01:12:56,813
A lot of people<br/>died that day.

996
01:12:56,947 --> 01:12:58,415
Yes, they did.

997
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:02,353
But we had a good time.

998
01:13:02,486 --> 01:13:03,587
Didn't we?

999
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,689
Yeah, we did.

1000
01:13:06,823 --> 01:13:08,425
After you, DeCoteau.

1001
01:13:09,894 --> 01:13:12,864
Pepe! Get your behind<br/>behind that bar.

1002
01:13:12,996 --> 01:13:14,698
I have a guest.

1003
01:13:30,814 --> 01:13:32,149
How's the beans?

1004
01:13:33,751 --> 01:13:35,119
I've had worse.

1005
01:13:37,388 --> 01:13:39,457
One dollar.

1006
01:13:42,425 --> 01:13:46,430
To my wife<br/>and all my sweethearts.

1007
01:13:46,563 --> 01:13:48,632
May they never meet.

1008
01:13:55,105 --> 01:13:58,675
Señor Madrid, you care<br/>to join me at my table

1009
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,244
where I entertain<br/>my guests?

1010
01:14:00,376 --> 01:14:02,913
I'd be<br/>delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.

1011
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:06,584
Take the bottle<br/>with you.

1012
01:14:08,285 --> 01:14:10,220
So, Johnny, ahem...

1013
01:14:12,121 --> 01:14:13,856
what brings you<br/>to Arroyo del Oro?

1014
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:16,894
Oh, you know me,<br/>Caleb.

1015
01:14:17,027 --> 01:14:18,529
Money.

1016
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,931
And who's paying<br/>around here?

1017
01:14:22,065 --> 01:14:23,533
I hope you.

1018
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,435
Huh.

1019
01:14:25,568 --> 01:14:27,937
And what have you<br/>heard about me?

1020
01:14:28,072 --> 01:14:29,907
I heard about<br/>the Lancer Ranch.

1021
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,209
All the cattle<br/>you've appropriated.

1022
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:33,711
A lot of land,<br/>a lot of cows,

1023
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,680
a lot of money,<br/>no law to speak of,

1024
01:14:35,813 --> 01:14:37,215
and nothing<br/>but an old man

1025
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:40,251
and some Mexican ranch hands<br/>to shoo you off.

1026
01:14:42,486 --> 01:14:44,689
Say, where's that<br/>chili pepper

1027
01:14:44,822 --> 01:14:47,091
daughter of yours<br/>with the fiddle?

1028
01:14:47,224 --> 01:14:48,992
She's asleep.

1029
01:14:49,126 --> 01:14:51,195
Wake her the heck up,<br/>get her down here

1030
01:14:51,327 --> 01:14:54,831
with her fiddle and her bow,<br/>and entertain my guest.

1031
01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:59,871
But, please, don't hurt her<br/>this time.

1032
01:15:01,505 --> 01:15:02,973
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1033
01:15:03,107 --> 01:15:06,810
I just want her<br/>to play the fiddle.

1034
01:15:10,281 --> 01:15:13,117
Line? "Go... Go fetch her<br/>and tell her" what?

1035
01:15:13,251 --> 01:15:14,752
"Go fetch her and tell her

1036
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,754
I'll give her a fat<br/>$5 gold piece..."

1037
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:18,322
Right. Go fetch her<br/>and tell her

1038
01:15:18,456 --> 01:15:20,291
I'll give her<br/>a fat-fat $5 gold piece,

1039
01:15:20,424 --> 01:15:22,760
she play her little<br/>chili pepper heart out, right?

1040
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:24,228
- Right.<br/>- Got it.

1041
01:15:30,434 --> 01:15:32,269
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1042
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,638
I just want her<br/>to play the fiddle.

1043
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:36,107
Now, go fetch her<br/>and tell her

1044
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,774
I'll give her<br/>a fat $5 gold piece,

1045
01:15:37,907 --> 01:15:40,944
she play her little<br/>chili pepper heart out.

1046
01:15:41,077 --> 01:15:42,779
Go on.

1047
01:15:47,117 --> 01:15:48,785
So, Johnny,

1048
01:15:50,054 --> 01:15:51,654
what else you heard?

1049
01:15:51,788 --> 01:15:53,256
Hmm.

1050
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:55,925
I heard you're pushing<br/>Lancer pretty hard,

1051
01:15:56,059 --> 01:15:58,763
but Lancer's got money.

1052
01:15:59,929 --> 01:16:01,965
At some point,

1053
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,368
he's gonna hire some guns

1054
01:16:04,501 --> 01:16:06,536
and push back.

1055
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:16,613
- Line. Line. Line, line, line.<br/>- "Maybe he already has."

1056
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:20,952
Maybe... Goddamn it!

1057
01:16:21,085 --> 01:16:22,620
I fucked this<br/>whole thing up, Sam.

1058
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:23,955
Keep going!

1059
01:16:24,087 --> 01:16:25,355
- I fucked this up.<br/>- Fight through it.

1060
01:16:25,488 --> 01:16:27,558
Can we just go back?<br/>Please, can we just cut?

1061
01:16:27,692 --> 01:16:29,026
Just say the fucking line!

1062
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,594
No, really, Sam, please.

1063
01:16:30,728 --> 01:16:32,196
- "Maybe he already has."<br/>- All right!

1064
01:16:32,328 --> 01:16:34,697
- "Maybe he already has!"<br/>- All right, goddamn it!

1065
01:16:34,831 --> 01:16:35,799
All right, all right!

1066
01:16:35,933 --> 01:16:37,201
Woo!

1067
01:16:37,334 --> 01:16:39,370
You're a goddamn outlaw,<br/>Rick. Come on, now.

1068
01:16:39,502 --> 01:16:41,005
Woo!

1069
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:42,873
I got it. I got it.

1070
01:16:44,241 --> 01:16:45,609
Go back a bit, would you?

1071
01:16:45,742 --> 01:16:48,011
No, he's right. Back to one.

1072
01:16:48,144 --> 01:16:50,513
- Okay, now, use all that, baby.<br/>- I'm gonna use it.

1073
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:52,983
- Oh, I'm gonna use it.<br/>- Put it all inside.

1074
01:16:53,116 --> 01:16:54,051
I'm gonna use it.

1075
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,055
And...

1076
01:16:58,154 --> 01:16:59,523
action.

1077
01:17:02,425 --> 01:17:04,727
I heard you're pushing<br/>Lancer pretty hard,

1078
01:17:04,862 --> 01:17:07,364
but Lancer's got money.

1079
01:17:08,532 --> 01:17:10,434
At some point,

1080
01:17:10,568 --> 01:17:14,839
he's gonna hire<br/>some guns and push back.

1081
01:17:18,341 --> 01:17:21,077
Maybe he already has.

1082
01:17:21,211 --> 01:17:23,714
Maybe.

1083
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,085
Maybe<br/>I don't like Lancer.

1084
01:17:29,586 --> 01:17:31,388
Maybe I don't like<br/>his boots.

1085
01:17:33,056 --> 01:17:34,724
Maybe I don't like the way

1086
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:37,928
he uses those boots<br/>to step on people.

1087
01:17:41,564 --> 01:17:43,132
What the fuck was that?!

1088
01:17:43,267 --> 01:17:45,702
Jesus Christ!

1089
01:17:45,836 --> 01:17:47,037
Fuck!

1090
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:49,372
Piece of shit.

1091
01:17:49,506 --> 01:17:51,474
Fucking damn it, Rick,<br/>I swear to God.

1092
01:17:51,608 --> 01:17:53,811
Forgot your fucking lines,<br/>embarrassed yourself

1093
01:17:53,943 --> 01:17:56,145
like that in front of all<br/>those goddamn people!

1094
01:17:56,278 --> 01:17:59,248
You were drinking all night,<br/>fucking drinking again,

1095
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:02,252
eight goddamn fucking<br/>whiskey sours.

1096
01:18:02,385 --> 01:18:05,455
Fucking bullshit.

1097
01:18:07,491 --> 01:18:09,761
You're a fucking<br/>miserable drunk.

1098
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:12,196
Not fucking remembering<br/>your fucking lines.

1099
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:14,264
I practiced them,<br/>and now I don't look

1100
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,033
like I goddamn practiced them!

1101
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:18,302
You're sitting there<br/>like a fucking baboon!

1102
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:22,105
Fuck! Eight fucking<br/>whiskey sours.

1103
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:25,209
I couldn't stop at fucking<br/>three or four. I have eight!

1104
01:18:25,343 --> 01:18:27,077
Why?! You're<br/>a fucking alcoholic.

1105
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:28,913
You fucking drink<br/>too much, huh?

1106
01:18:29,045 --> 01:18:31,414
Every fucking night.<br/>Every fucking night.

1107
01:18:31,549 --> 01:18:33,149
That's it,<br/>that's fucking it!

1108
01:18:33,282 --> 01:18:34,550
That's fucking it.

1109
01:18:34,684 --> 01:18:36,920
You stop drinking right now,<br/>all right?

1110
01:18:37,054 --> 01:18:38,322
Make a promise to yourself.

1111
01:18:38,455 --> 01:18:40,558
You're gonna stop<br/>fucking drinking.

1112
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:41,725
Oh, fuck it.

1113
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,230
Damn it!

1114
01:18:47,363 --> 01:18:49,065
You show that<br/>little fucking girl.

1115
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,135
You're gonna show<br/>that goddamn Jim Stacy.

1116
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,670
You're gonna show them<br/>on that goddamn fucking set

1117
01:18:53,804 --> 01:18:55,605
who the fuck<br/>Rick Dalton is, all right?

1118
01:18:55,738 --> 01:18:57,840
Let me tell you something.

1119
01:18:57,974 --> 01:19:00,577
You don't get<br/>these lines right,

1120
01:19:00,711 --> 01:19:03,614
I'm gonna blow<br/>your fucking brains out tonight.

1121
01:19:03,747 --> 01:19:05,616
All right?<br/>Your brains are gonna

1122
01:19:05,748 --> 01:19:08,085
be splattered<br/>all over your goddamn pool.

1123
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:10,153
I mean it, motherfucker.

1124
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,555
Get your shit together.

1125
01:20:17,787 --> 01:20:19,522
- Better? Okay.<br/>- It's great.

1126
01:21:45,509 --> 01:21:46,510
Hey!

1127
01:21:47,577 --> 01:21:48,479
Hi.

1128
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:53,683
Huh.

1129
01:21:53,817 --> 01:21:55,819
Woo!

1130
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:57,154
Shit.

1131
01:22:03,926 --> 01:22:06,330
Fuck you, you fucking pig!

1132
01:22:06,462 --> 01:22:08,299
Oh, no.

1133
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:24,847
Hello, hot stuff.

1134
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:27,317
Looks like third time's<br/>the charm.

1135
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,319
Mm. How were those pickles?

1136
01:22:32,622 --> 01:22:34,457
Real good.

1137
01:22:34,591 --> 01:22:35,893
They were<br/>the fancy kind.

1138
01:22:36,026 --> 01:22:37,528
- Mmm.<br/>- Mmm.

1139
01:22:38,929 --> 01:22:40,163
Give me a lift?

1140
01:22:40,296 --> 01:22:41,531
Where are you going?

1141
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,169
I'm going to Chatsworth.

1142
01:22:45,301 --> 01:22:47,237
Chatsworth?

1143
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:50,073
You hitch up and down<br/>Burbank Boulevard all day

1144
01:22:50,206 --> 01:22:52,741
till someone says they'll<br/>drive you to Chatsworth?

1145
01:22:52,876 --> 01:22:54,512
Tourists love to drive me.

1146
01:22:54,644 --> 01:22:56,846
I'm their favorite part<br/>of their L.A. vacation.

1147
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:00,417
They'll be telling stories<br/>about the Hollywood hippie girl

1148
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:02,486
that they gave a ride<br/>to the movie ranch

1149
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:04,220
for the rest of their lives.

1150
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:05,756
Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?

1151
01:23:07,123 --> 01:23:08,591
- Yeah.<br/>- That's where you're going?

1152
01:23:08,724 --> 01:23:09,658
Spahn Movie Ranch?

1153
01:23:09,792 --> 01:23:10,827
Uh-huh.

1154
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:12,163
Why you going there?

1155
01:23:12,962 --> 01:23:13,863
I live there.

1156
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:17,233
- Alone?<br/>- No.

1157
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:18,669
Me and my friends.

1158
01:23:20,104 --> 01:23:22,406
So you and a bunch<br/>of friends like you

1159
01:23:22,538 --> 01:23:24,375
all live<br/>at Spahn Movie Ranch?

1160
01:23:25,841 --> 01:23:26,743
Yeah.

1161
01:23:29,078 --> 01:23:30,648
Well, hop in.<br/>I'll take you there.

1162
01:23:31,581 --> 01:23:32,783
Great!

1163
01:23:42,259 --> 01:23:44,426
Go down here and get on<br/>the Hollywood Freeway.

1164
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,996
I know where it is.

1165
01:23:48,031 --> 01:23:51,301
Are you some old cowboy guy<br/>that used to make movies there?

1166
01:23:51,434 --> 01:23:52,935
Whoa!

1167
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:54,571
What?

1168
01:23:54,703 --> 01:23:56,072
I'm just surprised<br/>how accurate

1169
01:23:56,206 --> 01:23:57,940
that description<br/>of me really is.

1170
01:23:58,073 --> 01:24:01,411
Some old cowboy guy that used<br/>to shoot movies at Spahn Ranch.

1171
01:24:01,545 --> 01:24:05,015
So you used to make Westerns<br/>at the ranch

1172
01:24:05,148 --> 01:24:07,518
back in the old-timey days?

1173
01:24:09,286 --> 01:24:11,855
Well, if by<br/>"the old-timey days,"

1174
01:24:11,987 --> 01:24:15,291
you mean television<br/>eight years ago, yeah.

1175
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:16,760
Are you an actor?

1176
01:24:16,894 --> 01:24:18,496
No, I'm a stuntman.

1177
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:21,431
You're a stuntman.

1178
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,735
That's way better.

1179
01:24:24,868 --> 01:24:26,170
Why is that way better?

1180
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:29,607
- Actors are phony.<br/>- Oh.

1181
01:24:29,739 --> 01:24:31,808
They just say lines<br/>that other people write

1182
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:35,612
and pretend to murder people<br/>on their stupid TV shows.

1183
01:24:35,745 --> 01:24:38,814
Meanwhile, real people are being<br/>murdered every day in Vietnam.

1184
01:25:01,504 --> 01:25:03,373
Want me to suck your cock<br/>while driving?

1185
01:25:12,282 --> 01:25:13,284
How old are you?

1186
01:25:14,584 --> 01:25:15,551
What?

1187
01:25:15,684 --> 01:25:17,353
How old are you?

1188
01:25:19,689 --> 01:25:20,623
Wow, man.

1189
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:23,926
That's the first time<br/>anybody asked that

1190
01:25:24,059 --> 01:25:25,327
in a long time.

1191
01:25:25,461 --> 01:25:26,930
What's the answer?

1192
01:25:29,498 --> 01:25:32,903
Okay. We gonna play<br/>kiddie games?

1193
01:25:34,203 --> 01:25:36,773
Eighteen. Feel better?

1194
01:25:36,907 --> 01:25:38,708
You got some ID,<br/>you know,

1195
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:41,009
like a driver's license<br/>or something?

1196
01:25:41,144 --> 01:25:43,780
- Are you joking?<br/>- No, I'm not.

1197
01:25:43,912 --> 01:25:47,383
I need to see something official<br/>that verifies that you're 18,

1198
01:25:47,518 --> 01:25:50,287
which you don't have<br/>because you're not.

1199
01:25:53,556 --> 01:25:56,059
Talk about a bring-down bummer,<br/>dude.

1200
01:25:56,192 --> 01:25:57,261
That's you.

1201
01:25:57,394 --> 01:25:58,596
Yeah.

1202
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:07,070
Obviously,<br/>I'm not too young to fuck you.

1203
01:26:07,203 --> 01:26:09,372
But obviously,<br/>you are too old to fuck me.

1204
01:26:10,907 --> 01:26:14,277
What I'm too old to do<br/>is go to jail for poontang.

1205
01:26:16,246 --> 01:26:18,248
Prison's been trying to get me<br/>all my life.

1206
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:20,750
It ain't got me yet.<br/>The day it does,

1207
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,286
it won't be because of you.

1208
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,555
No offense.

1209
01:26:27,523 --> 01:26:29,358
<i>You all right?</i>

1210
01:26:29,492 --> 01:26:31,861
She's just<br/>fine, ain't you, shorty?

1211
01:26:31,995 --> 01:26:33,697
<i>I'm fine, Scott.</i>

1212
01:26:33,831 --> 01:26:35,297
<i>They haven't hurt you?</i>

1213
01:26:35,431 --> 01:26:37,233
Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.

1214
01:26:38,934 --> 01:26:40,203
I'll be right out.

1215
01:26:41,604 --> 01:26:43,806
<i>The war.</i>

1216
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:46,777
<i>I rode with<br/>the British cavalry in Indi...</i>

1217
01:27:39,028 --> 01:27:41,665
Stand by, guys.<br/>We're going in five.

1218
01:27:56,545 --> 01:27:59,048
Lancer's boys are here!

1219
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:01,218
The old man here?

1220
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:02,919
Nada.

1221
01:28:03,051 --> 01:28:04,520
But the son is.

1222
01:28:06,622 --> 01:28:08,590
Ah. Heh, heh.

1223
01:28:08,724 --> 01:28:10,193
The one from Boston.

1224
01:28:11,394 --> 01:28:12,328
I don't know.

1225
01:28:13,362 --> 01:28:14,730
You from Boston?

1226
01:28:14,864 --> 01:28:15,898
Yes.

1227
01:28:16,032 --> 01:28:17,501
It's the Boston one!

1228
01:28:19,303 --> 01:28:21,104
Keep the others outside.

1229
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:23,674
Let the brother come in.

1230
01:28:25,309 --> 01:28:27,044
You heard him, Boston.

1231
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,821
Come on in, Boston.

1232
01:28:39,121 --> 01:28:40,556
See, honey?

1233
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,893
I told you they'd come<br/>to parlay.

1234
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:45,761
You all right,<br/>honey?

1235
01:28:45,895 --> 01:28:48,898
Oh, she's just fine.

1236
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:50,701
Ain't you, shorty?

1237
01:28:51,901 --> 01:28:53,836
I'm fine, Scott.

1238
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:55,739
They haven't hurt you?

1239
01:28:55,871 --> 01:28:57,940
Not yet, I ain't.

1240
01:28:58,073 --> 01:28:59,876
But that can all change...

1241
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:01,911
like that.

1242
01:29:05,747 --> 01:29:07,216
Say...

1243
01:29:07,349 --> 01:29:09,018
where'd you get that limp?

1244
01:29:10,487 --> 01:29:11,788
- From the war.<br/>- Mm.

1245
01:29:13,089 --> 01:29:14,690
Which side?

1246
01:29:14,825 --> 01:29:18,027
I rode with the British cavalry<br/>in India.

1247
01:29:18,161 --> 01:29:19,729
Mm.

1248
01:29:19,862 --> 01:29:22,364
What'd they call that outfit?

1249
01:29:22,497 --> 01:29:23,899
Bengal Lancers.

1250
01:29:27,836 --> 01:29:29,871
Now, now, now,<br/>that is funny.

1251
01:29:30,005 --> 01:29:32,441
- That is funny.<br/>- That's not so funny.

1252
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:33,809
Don't you get it?

1253
01:29:33,943 --> 01:29:35,812
"Bengal Lancer"?

1254
01:29:35,944 --> 01:29:37,281
Hm?

1255
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:38,748
Oh, yeah.

1256
01:29:38,881 --> 01:29:40,482
I get it now.

1257
01:29:40,617 --> 01:29:43,686
- That is kind of funny.<br/>- It is.

1258
01:29:43,819 --> 01:29:47,189
You do know kidnapping<br/>is a hanging offense.

1259
01:29:47,323 --> 01:29:49,792
So is blowing the heads<br/>off little girls.

1260
01:29:51,327 --> 01:29:54,330
But they can only hang me<br/>once, right?

1261
01:29:55,497 --> 01:29:56,433
So...

1262
01:29:58,067 --> 01:29:59,636
you come down here for a...

1263
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:02,005
For a Boston social?

1264
01:30:02,138 --> 01:30:04,774
- Or we gonna talk price?<br/>- How much?

1265
01:30:04,907 --> 01:30:08,877
I'd say $50,000 would buy me

1266
01:30:09,011 --> 01:30:12,482
a whole lot of chicken mole<br/>in Mexico.

1267
01:30:12,614 --> 01:30:14,017
That's a lot of money.

1268
01:30:14,149 --> 01:30:16,486
Well, she's a lot<br/>of little girl.

1269
01:30:16,618 --> 01:30:18,386
Or don't you agree?

1270
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,822
I agree.

1271
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,459
So, what's next?

1272
01:30:23,593 --> 01:30:25,961
Well, I'll send one of my boys<br/>out to your ranch

1273
01:30:26,095 --> 01:30:28,365
to fill you in<br/>on all the details, but, uh...

1274
01:30:30,166 --> 01:30:34,071
the one detail I'm gonna fill<br/>you in on right now is this:

1275
01:30:35,438 --> 01:30:38,373
I don't want<br/>no beaner bronco buster

1276
01:30:38,507 --> 01:30:40,109
handing me that $50,000.

1277
01:30:40,243 --> 01:30:43,380
I want the old man himself.

1278
01:30:43,513 --> 01:30:49,051
Murdoch Lancer<br/>puts $50,000 in my lap...

1279
01:30:49,184 --> 01:30:52,354
or I heave this little pitcher<br/>down a well!

1280
01:30:52,487 --> 01:30:54,990
You got that, Boston?

1281
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:56,859
Huh?

1282
01:30:56,992 --> 01:30:58,393
Yeah.

1283
01:30:58,528 --> 01:31:00,797
All right, messenger boy.

1284
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:03,866
Deliver my message.

1285
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:14,076
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.

1286
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:16,011
Settle into it.

1287
01:31:16,144 --> 01:31:18,147
Enjoy it.

1288
01:31:18,281 --> 01:31:19,381
And cut!

1289
01:31:22,051 --> 01:31:23,219
Oh, boy.

1290
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:24,921
I didn't hurt you there,<br/>Marabella,

1291
01:31:25,054 --> 01:31:27,390
- with that throw, did I?<br/>- No, no, no. I'm good.

1292
01:31:27,523 --> 01:31:29,024
I got pads on.

1293
01:31:29,158 --> 01:31:31,161
And I throw myself on the floor

1294
01:31:31,294 --> 01:31:34,264
just for fun,<br/>even when I'm not getting paid.

1295
01:31:34,397 --> 01:31:35,665
The gate's clean.

1296
01:31:35,797 --> 01:31:38,201
Rick, Rick, Rick.

1297
01:31:38,334 --> 01:31:39,903
Put her there.

1298
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:41,136
- That was it.<br/>- Really?

1299
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:42,705
That was absolutely fantastic.

1300
01:31:42,839 --> 01:31:44,107
- Oh, thank you.<br/>- I loved it.

1301
01:31:44,241 --> 01:31:46,109
Your idea about<br/>throwing the little girl

1302
01:31:46,242 --> 01:31:48,044
on the ground<br/>just worked like a charm.

1303
01:31:48,178 --> 01:31:50,145
I figured you said Shakespeare,<br/>so... Yeah.

1304
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:51,380
That's right. That was...

1305
01:31:51,514 --> 01:31:53,584
That's what I mean<br/>by "scare me."

1306
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:56,085
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.<br/>- Evil Hamlet scares people.

1307
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:58,621
- All right.<br/>- Oh, and by the way...

1308
01:31:58,754 --> 01:32:00,823
- "Beaner bronco buster"?<br/>- Yeah.

1309
01:32:00,956 --> 01:32:02,491
Where the hell<br/>did that come from?

1310
01:32:02,626 --> 01:32:04,761
- I don't know. Improv.<br/>- That was wonderful.

1311
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:08,298
It was just... That was<br/>a triple alliterative improv.

1312
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:09,933
You don't hear those<br/>too often.

1313
01:32:10,065 --> 01:32:11,901
- Okay? We're good.<br/>- All right. We don't...?

1314
01:32:12,035 --> 01:32:13,603
- Don't need to go again?<br/>- We're done.

1315
01:32:13,736 --> 01:32:15,071
- That was fantastic.<br/>- All right.

1316
01:32:15,203 --> 01:32:17,072
Okay, moving on.<br/>We're in the bordello.

1317
01:32:17,206 --> 01:32:18,608
Next setup!

1318
01:32:22,411 --> 01:32:26,149
That was the best acting<br/>I've ever seen in my whole life.

1319
01:32:27,617 --> 01:32:28,484
Thank you.

1320
01:32:28,617 --> 01:32:29,785
Heh.

1321
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:48,438
Rick fucking Dalton.

1322
01:33:01,885 --> 01:33:02,986
That's a car.

1323
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,756
That's a strange car.

1324
01:33:07,122 --> 01:33:09,459
Snake, go see<br/>who's outside.

1325
01:33:21,938 --> 01:33:23,340
So who is it?

1326
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:25,308
I ain't for sure yet.

1327
01:33:25,442 --> 01:33:27,643
It's a bitchen yellow<br/>Coupe de Ville.

1328
01:33:27,777 --> 01:33:29,880
Keep an eye on him.

1329
01:34:18,728 --> 01:34:20,263
Come on.

1330
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:38,614
Where the hell<br/>is everybody?

1331
01:34:47,924 --> 01:34:49,358
Hey, where's Gypsy?

1332
01:34:49,492 --> 01:34:51,194
She's down<br/>by the chop shop.

1333
01:34:58,033 --> 01:35:00,135
- Hey!<br/>- Hello!

1334
01:35:00,269 --> 01:35:03,305
Gypsy! I want you<br/>to come meet my new friend.

1335
01:35:03,438 --> 01:35:05,740
Some old-looking<br/>dude in a Hawaiian shirt

1336
01:35:05,875 --> 01:35:07,544
who just gave Pussycat<br/>a ride home.

1337
01:35:07,676 --> 01:35:09,278
He just gave her a lift?

1338
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:11,414
Nope. She's bringing him

1339
01:35:11,547 --> 01:35:13,416
down the ranch<br/>to meet everybody.

1340
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:16,118
Stay by the door.<br/>Tell me if he starts coming this way.

1341
01:35:18,287 --> 01:35:20,590
- Welcome to our community.<br/>- Thanks for having me.

1342
01:35:20,723 --> 01:35:23,158
Thank you for giving<br/>our precious Pussy a ride home.

1343
01:35:23,291 --> 01:35:24,493
Think nothing of it.

1344
01:35:24,626 --> 01:35:25,995
We love Pussy.

1345
01:35:26,129 --> 01:35:27,631
Yes, we do.

1346
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:29,899
Hey, where is everybody?<br/>Where's the children?

1347
01:35:30,032 --> 01:35:32,567
Everybody left<br/>for Santa Barbara.

1348
01:35:32,702 --> 01:35:34,170
Really?

1349
01:35:34,304 --> 01:35:36,305
Charlie's gone?<br/>Everybody left?

1350
01:35:36,438 --> 01:35:39,441
Well, not "everybody" everybody,<br/>but mostly everybody.

1351
01:35:42,411 --> 01:35:43,313
Drag.

1352
01:35:44,714 --> 01:35:47,317
I really wanted Cliff<br/>to meet Charlie.

1353
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,719
I think Charlie's<br/>really gonna dig you.

1354
01:35:49,853 --> 01:35:52,154
- Angel, hold up.<br/>- Well, maybe next time.

1355
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,724
Yeah, you got to come back.

1356
01:35:54,858 --> 01:35:56,827
- Yeah?<br/>- Yeah, sure.

1357
01:35:58,661 --> 01:36:01,663
So how's it all<br/>comparing to your glory days?

1358
01:36:01,796 --> 01:36:03,366
Well, things have changed.

1359
01:36:06,769 --> 01:36:08,671
Not a bad mount, Connie.

1360
01:36:08,804 --> 01:36:11,139
I used to ride horses<br/>every day back in Tennessee.

1361
01:36:11,273 --> 01:36:13,309
- Is that right?<br/>- Every day?

1362
01:36:13,442 --> 01:36:15,345
Well, every week.

1363
01:36:15,478 --> 01:36:17,046
All right.

1364
01:36:17,179 --> 01:36:18,880
Ain't she just darling?

1365
01:36:22,519 --> 01:36:25,688
So, uh, my name is Lulu.

1366
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:27,590
This is Tex.

1367
01:36:27,724 --> 01:36:29,992
We're gonna be leading you<br/>on a great trail ride

1368
01:36:30,126 --> 01:36:32,495
through the beautiful<br/>Santa Susana canyons.

1369
01:36:32,629 --> 01:36:35,832
Now, Curt, I hear you're already<br/>an experienced rider.

1370
01:36:35,965 --> 01:36:38,233
- Yes.<br/>- Yeah, so are you, Connie?

1371
01:36:38,367 --> 01:36:40,370
- Yes, I am.<br/>- Hey, Tex? Come here.

1372
01:36:40,502 --> 01:36:43,005
So, uh, if you're both<br/>experienced riders,

1373
01:36:43,139 --> 01:36:46,276
I guess we'll just make<br/>this ride about having fun.

1374
01:36:46,408 --> 01:36:47,675
You ready to have some fun?

1375
01:36:47,809 --> 01:36:50,545
So Pussycat brought back<br/>some guy with her.

1376
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:52,647
Gypsy wants you<br/>to go give him a look-see.

1377
01:36:52,781 --> 01:36:54,350
Yeah. Sure thing.

1378
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:16,172
Oh, and here's someone<br/>you absolutely have to meet.

1379
01:37:16,305 --> 01:37:18,607
One of our most favorite sons.

1380
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:21,377
Tex, come on over here<br/>and say hi to Cliff.

1381
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:23,612
- Howdy, Cliff.<br/>- Tex.

1382
01:37:23,746 --> 01:37:27,250
- What part of Texas you from?<br/>- Oh, a place you never heard of.

1383
01:37:27,382 --> 01:37:28,250
Copeville.

1384
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:30,587
Ah. Ever been to Houston?

1385
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,188
Course I have.

1386
01:37:32,321 --> 01:37:34,790
Yeah, I spent two weeks once<br/>on a Houston chain gang.

1387
01:37:34,924 --> 01:37:36,559
In August, no less.

1388
01:37:36,692 --> 01:37:39,095
That doesn't sound like<br/>a whole lot of fun.

1389
01:37:39,228 --> 01:37:42,131
It's the last cop's jaw I ever<br/>broke, I can tell you that.

1390
01:37:46,568 --> 01:37:47,469
Man...

1391
01:37:48,772 --> 01:37:51,241
Charlie's gonna dig you.

1392
01:37:51,373 --> 01:37:53,643
The Hawaiian guy<br/>seems to be okay.

1393
01:37:53,776 --> 01:37:56,178
Everybody's talking<br/>all friendly.

1394
01:37:56,312 --> 01:37:58,846
- Enjoy your day!<br/>- Thank you.

1395
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:02,151
Tex checked him out,<br/>and now he's riding away.

1396
01:38:02,285 --> 01:38:04,586
If he comes this<br/>way, let me know.

1397
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:09,825
Hey, does George Spahn<br/>still own this ranch?

1398
01:38:09,959 --> 01:38:12,495
Yeah, George<br/>still owns it.

1399
01:38:12,627 --> 01:38:15,031
- Does he still live here?<br/>- Yeah.

1400
01:38:15,163 --> 01:38:18,032
Does he still live<br/>right there?

1401
01:38:18,166 --> 01:38:19,134
Yeah.

1402
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:20,536
Is he here now?

1403
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:22,272
I guess so.

1404
01:38:24,273 --> 01:38:26,875
So George gave you all<br/>permission to be here?

1405
01:38:28,109 --> 01:38:29,278
Course he did.

1406
01:38:29,412 --> 01:38:30,981
And y'all take care of him?

1407
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:34,283
Oh, we take care<br/>of George.

1408
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:35,517
We love George.

1409
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,321
Well,<br/>is there anything wrong

1410
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:41,623
with me saying hello<br/>to an old friend?

1411
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:43,526
You can't see him<br/>right now.

1412
01:38:43,658 --> 01:38:45,894
Why can't I see him<br/>right now?

1413
01:38:47,496 --> 01:38:49,164
Because<br/>he's napping.

1414
01:38:50,965 --> 01:38:52,968
This is his nap time.

1415
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:05,047
Well, I think I'll just<br/>go see for myself.

1416
01:39:06,415 --> 01:39:08,216
You never know.

1417
01:39:08,349 --> 01:39:10,018
He might have just woke up.

1418
01:39:19,595 --> 01:39:21,731
The old Hawaiian<br/>guy's coming this way.

1419
01:39:22,965 --> 01:39:24,567
Okay, y'all, beat it.

1420
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:26,036
I'll handle this guy.

1421
01:39:30,139 --> 01:39:31,140
Fine.

1422
01:40:16,786 --> 01:40:18,288
You the mama bear?

1423
01:40:20,089 --> 01:40:22,158
- Can I help you?<br/>- I hope so.

1424
01:40:22,291 --> 01:40:25,259
I'm an old friend of George's.<br/>Thought I'd stop and say hello.

1425
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:26,762
That's very nice of you,

1426
01:40:26,894 --> 01:40:28,730
but you picked<br/>the wrong time.

1427
01:40:28,864 --> 01:40:30,832
George is taking a nap<br/>right now.

1428
01:40:30,966 --> 01:40:32,835
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1429
01:40:32,968 --> 01:40:34,237
Yes, it is.

1430
01:40:35,604 --> 01:40:38,007
- What's your name?<br/>- Cliff Booth.

1431
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:39,507
How do you know George?

1432
01:40:39,642 --> 01:40:42,010
I used to shoot Westerns<br/>here at the ranch.

1433
01:40:42,144 --> 01:40:44,413
When was the last time<br/>you saw George?

1434
01:40:44,546 --> 01:40:47,750
Oh, I'd say about...

1435
01:40:48,651 --> 01:40:49,986
eight years ago.

1436
01:40:51,554 --> 01:40:53,089
Oh. I'm sorry.

1437
01:40:53,223 --> 01:40:55,357
I didn't realize the two of you<br/>were so close.

1438
01:40:55,491 --> 01:40:57,193
When he wakes up,

1439
01:40:57,327 --> 01:40:59,429
I'll let him know you came by.

1440
01:40:59,562 --> 01:41:02,064
I'd really like to say<br/>a quick hello now

1441
01:41:02,197 --> 01:41:03,431
while I'm here.

1442
01:41:03,564 --> 01:41:05,067
Came a long ways.

1443
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,937
Don't know when I'll get back<br/>this way again.

1444
01:41:08,069 --> 01:41:11,506
Oh, I understand, but I'm<br/>afraid that's impossible.

1445
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:13,274
Impossible?

1446
01:41:13,408 --> 01:41:15,143
Why is that impossible?

1447
01:41:15,278 --> 01:41:17,513
Me and George like<br/>to watch TV on Sunday night...

1448
01:41:17,647 --> 01:41:19,782
<i>F.B.I.</i> and <i>Bonanza.</i><br/>...but George finds it hard

1449
01:41:19,916 --> 01:41:21,350
to keep awake,<br/>so I make him nap

1450
01:41:21,483 --> 01:41:23,619
so I don't get gypped out<br/>of my TV time.

1451
01:41:23,752 --> 01:41:24,987
Ah.

1452
01:41:26,322 --> 01:41:30,359
Well, look, Red,<br/>I'm coming in there.

1453
01:41:30,492 --> 01:41:34,496
With my own two eyes, I'm gonna<br/>get a good look at George.

1454
01:41:35,264 --> 01:41:36,466
And this...

1455
01:41:38,466 --> 01:41:40,103
ain't stopping me.

1456
01:41:43,572 --> 01:41:44,473
Okay.

1457
01:41:45,675 --> 01:41:47,210
Suit yourself.

1458
01:43:13,261 --> 01:43:14,930
He back there?

1459
01:43:16,265 --> 01:43:18,233
Door at the end<br/>of the hallway.

1460
01:43:19,535 --> 01:43:21,069
You might have to<br/>shake him awake.

1461
01:43:21,203 --> 01:43:22,938
I fucked his brains out<br/>this morning.

1462
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:30,212
He may be tired.

1463
01:43:41,791 --> 01:43:43,459
Oh, Mr. Eight Years Ago?

1464
01:43:45,294 --> 01:43:46,761
George is blind,

1465
01:43:46,894 --> 01:43:49,431
so you'll probably<br/>have to tell him who you are.

1466
01:44:14,922 --> 01:44:16,358
George, you awake?

1467
01:44:34,777 --> 01:44:35,712
George?

1468
01:44:38,113 --> 01:44:39,047
George?

1469
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:44,019
George?

1470
01:44:46,888 --> 01:44:49,390
- George!<br/>- Jesus.

1471
01:44:49,524 --> 01:44:52,027
- Hi, George.<br/>- Wait a minute.

1472
01:44:52,161 --> 01:44:54,197
- What's going on?<br/>- Everything's all right.

1473
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:57,399
- I'm sorry to disturb you.<br/>- Uh... Who are you?

1474
01:44:57,532 --> 01:44:59,402
It's Cliff Booth.

1475
01:44:59,535 --> 01:45:02,604
Just stopped in to say hello<br/>and see how you're doing.

1476
01:45:02,737 --> 01:45:04,205
John Wilkes Booth?

1477
01:45:04,339 --> 01:45:05,675
No, Cliff Booth.

1478
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:09,244
Who's that?

1479
01:45:09,377 --> 01:45:11,913
I used to shoot<br/><i>Bounty Law</i> here, George.

1480
01:45:12,046 --> 01:45:14,015
I was Rick Dalton's<br/>stunt double.

1481
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:16,919
- Who?<br/>- Rick Dalton.

1482
01:45:17,051 --> 01:45:18,586
The Dalton Brothers?

1483
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,322
No, Rick Dalton.

1484
01:45:21,857 --> 01:45:23,024
Who's that?

1485
01:45:23,158 --> 01:45:25,928
He was the star<br/>of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1486
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,729
And who are you?

1487
01:45:27,862 --> 01:45:29,498
I was Rick's stunt double.

1488
01:45:30,698 --> 01:45:32,567
Rick who?

1489
01:45:32,701 --> 01:45:34,403
It don't matter, George.

1490
01:45:34,536 --> 01:45:37,573
We were colleagues<br/>from the past, and I just wanted

1491
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:39,541
to make sure<br/>you're doing okay.

1492
01:45:39,675 --> 01:45:41,944
- I'm not doing okay.<br/>- What's the matter?

1493
01:45:42,077 --> 01:45:43,746
Can't see shit.

1494
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:45,614
Would you call that<br/>"the matter"?

1495
01:45:45,747 --> 01:45:47,448
The man can't see shit,<br/>okay?

1496
01:45:47,582 --> 01:45:50,018
I know. I'm sorry about that.<br/>I was told.

1497
01:45:50,152 --> 01:45:52,721
Squeaky<br/>sent me to bed.

1498
01:45:52,854 --> 01:45:55,089
Would that be<br/>the little redhead out front?

1499
01:45:58,094 --> 01:46:00,529
What the fuck<br/>is the matter with you?

1500
01:46:00,662 --> 01:46:02,097
First you wake me up,

1501
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:04,599
and now you're pretending<br/>that I didn't tell you

1502
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:06,769
I was fucking blind!

1503
01:46:06,902 --> 01:46:09,938
How am I gonna know<br/>what the hell color the head

1504
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:12,774
of the girl is that's with me<br/>all the time?

1505
01:46:12,907 --> 01:46:14,676
Oh, fair enough, George.

1506
01:46:18,212 --> 01:46:21,483
- No. Jesus Christ.<br/>- Come on, George. All right.

1507
01:46:21,617 --> 01:46:24,120
Everyone<br/>don't need a stuntman.

1508
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,163
I don't know who you are...

1509
01:46:35,797 --> 01:46:37,834
but you touched me today.

1510
01:46:39,835 --> 01:46:42,337
You came to visit me.

1511
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:44,505
Now I got to go back to sleep.

1512
01:46:47,076 --> 01:46:49,711
I got to watch<br/><i>F.B.I.</i> tonight.

1513
01:46:49,845 --> 01:46:51,347
I watch it with Squeaky.

1514
01:46:52,814 --> 01:46:56,285
She gets all pissed off<br/>if I fall asleep.

1515
01:46:56,417 --> 01:46:59,221
What happens when she<br/>gets pissed off, George?

1516
01:47:00,589 --> 01:47:01,623
Nothing.

1517
01:47:03,291 --> 01:47:05,627
I just don't like<br/>to disappoint her.

1518
01:47:10,498 --> 01:47:14,202
So you gave all these hippies<br/>permission to be here?

1519
01:47:19,774 --> 01:47:22,176
Just who the fuck are you?

1520
01:47:22,309 --> 01:47:24,178
I'm Cliff Booth.

1521
01:47:24,312 --> 01:47:25,514
I'm a stuntman.

1522
01:47:25,647 --> 01:47:27,815
We used to work together,<br/>George.

1523
01:47:27,950 --> 01:47:30,652
And I just want<br/>to make sure you're okay.

1524
01:47:30,786 --> 01:47:34,456
And that all these hippies<br/>aren't taking advantage of you.

1525
01:47:34,589 --> 01:47:37,326
- Squeaky?<br/>- Yeah.

1526
01:47:37,459 --> 01:47:39,729
She loves me.

1527
01:47:41,929 --> 01:47:44,032
So suck on that.

1528
01:47:52,506 --> 01:47:54,175
You take care, George.

1529
01:48:01,015 --> 01:48:02,651
Goddamn it.

1530
01:48:24,105 --> 01:48:25,575
You embarrassed me.

1531
01:48:26,575 --> 01:48:28,911
Yeah, sorry about that.

1532
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,114
How'd your little talk<br/>with George go?

1533
01:48:33,247 --> 01:48:34,248
Are we kidnapping him?

1534
01:48:34,381 --> 01:48:36,117
Not the word I'd use.

1535
01:48:36,251 --> 01:48:38,454
Now you've talked to him, you<br/>believe everything's all right?

1536
01:48:38,586 --> 01:48:40,421
Not exactly.

1537
01:48:40,555 --> 01:48:42,456
This was a mistake.<br/>You should leave.

1538
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:44,326
Way ahead of you.

1539
01:48:48,464 --> 01:48:50,599
George isn't blind!

1540
01:48:50,732 --> 01:48:52,301
You're the blind one!

1541
01:49:37,145 --> 01:49:38,813
You do that?

1542
01:49:43,919 --> 01:49:45,955
You know, that's not my car.

1543
01:49:46,087 --> 01:49:48,157
That's my boss's car.

1544
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:50,593
And if something were to happen<br/>to my boss's car,

1545
01:49:50,725 --> 01:49:52,161
well, I'd get in trouble.

1546
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:11,880
Fix it.

1547
01:50:12,013 --> 01:50:14,183
Fuck you.

1548
01:50:40,407 --> 01:50:42,611
- Leave him alone!<br/>- He's a flower!

1549
01:50:42,745 --> 01:50:44,279
He's a flower, man.

1550
01:50:44,412 --> 01:50:46,747
He's just a flower.<br/>He doesn't know better.

1551
01:50:46,881 --> 01:50:48,683
Ladies.

1552
01:50:54,723 --> 01:50:57,760
Come one step closer<br/>and I will knock his teeth out.

1553
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:10,805
Fix it.

1554
01:51:10,938 --> 01:51:13,207
Can I at least get a rag<br/>to wipe my face first?

1555
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:14,809
Nope.

1556
01:51:14,943 --> 01:51:16,611
Tire first.

1557
01:51:26,589 --> 01:51:28,622
- Sundance.<br/>- Yeah.

1558
01:51:28,756 --> 01:51:32,260
Get on a horse, go get Tex<br/>and get his ass down here.

1559
01:51:32,394 --> 01:51:33,295
Okay.

1560
01:51:42,604 --> 01:51:44,306
<i>I love you.</i>

1561
01:52:08,697 --> 01:52:11,132
Tex! Tex!

1562
01:52:11,267 --> 01:52:12,968
That Hawaiian guy's<br/>back at the ranch

1563
01:52:13,102 --> 01:52:14,269
kicking Clem's face in.

1564
01:52:14,403 --> 01:52:16,171
Ah, son of a...

1565
01:52:16,304 --> 01:52:17,772
I'll take over for Tex.

1566
01:52:17,906 --> 01:52:19,575
Right this way.

1567
01:52:46,201 --> 01:52:48,037
Hyah! Hyah!

1568
01:53:09,825 --> 01:53:11,492
Clem, you all right?

1569
01:53:32,714 --> 01:53:34,349
How do?

1570
01:53:34,483 --> 01:53:37,753
What a day.<br/>Shit, I almost lost my shit.

1571
01:54:25,867 --> 01:54:27,069
You, uh...

1572
01:54:27,202 --> 01:54:29,271
You want to come in<br/>and watch my <i>F.B.I.?</i>

1573
01:54:29,404 --> 01:54:32,174
Why, I just figured we would.<br/>I got a six-pack in the back.

1574
01:54:32,306 --> 01:54:33,575
Thought we'd order a pizza.

1575
01:54:33,707 --> 01:54:34,942
All right.

1576
01:54:35,076 --> 01:54:36,344
All right.

1577
01:54:57,498 --> 01:55:00,001
<i>Eighteen miles to Pendleton,<br/>Willard.</i>

1578
01:55:00,135 --> 01:55:02,304
<i>Any kind of luck,<br/>we'll be unloaded</i>

1579
01:55:02,438 --> 01:55:04,940
<i>and back at El Toro<br/>before my kids go to bed.</i>

1580
01:55:09,778 --> 01:55:13,515
Hey, bought me<br/>an acid-dipped cigarette today.

1581
01:55:13,648 --> 01:55:14,950
Oh, yeah?

1582
01:55:15,082 --> 01:55:17,118
You want to buy<br/>a cigarette dipped in acid?

1583
01:55:17,251 --> 01:55:18,786
Yeah.

1584
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,955
If I'm gonna trip,<br/>I want to trip here, man.

1585
01:55:21,089 --> 01:55:23,158
Walk in the woods.<br/>Not in my home.

1586
01:55:25,126 --> 01:55:26,294
Just gonna stash it here.

1587
01:55:26,428 --> 01:55:28,529
- Don't smoke it by mistake.<br/>- Yeah.

1588
01:55:28,663 --> 01:55:31,498
You want to smoke some,<br/>smoke some. Just save me some.

1589
01:55:31,632 --> 01:55:34,868
Nah, I don't need<br/>to trip out on no acid.

1590
01:55:35,002 --> 01:55:36,839
My booze don't need no buddy.

1591
01:55:36,971 --> 01:55:38,172
Whoa! Oh!

1592
01:55:38,305 --> 01:55:40,142
Here I come. Here I come.

1593
01:55:42,176 --> 01:55:43,377
Mm.

1594
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:45,546
<i>What's the trouble, corporal?</i>

1595
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:47,215
<i>There's a truck tailing us,<br/>sir.</i>

1596
01:55:50,484 --> 01:55:52,955
<i>It might be a farmer<br/>in a hurry to get someplace.</i>

1597
01:55:54,822 --> 01:55:56,490
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

1598
01:55:56,625 --> 01:55:58,794
<i>Well,<br/>take it as fast as you can.</i>

1599
01:55:58,926 --> 01:55:59,995
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1600
01:56:03,297 --> 01:56:04,632
That PCH?

1601
01:56:04,765 --> 01:56:07,736
Yeah, yeah. Malibu.

1602
01:56:07,868 --> 01:56:10,171
Puerco Canyon or some shit.<br/>I don't know.

1603
01:56:16,010 --> 01:56:18,679
Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.

1604
01:56:21,849 --> 01:56:23,184
Boom! Ha, ha!

1605
01:56:23,318 --> 01:56:25,254
Oh, man. Right in the face.

1606
01:56:37,165 --> 01:56:38,733
That was a smooth leap.

1607
01:56:38,867 --> 01:56:39,768
Thank you.

1608
01:56:43,104 --> 01:56:45,941
Dead number two.

1609
01:56:52,679 --> 01:56:54,414
I like that shot.

1610
01:56:54,549 --> 01:56:57,051
That guy's a fucking prick.

1611
01:57:03,358 --> 01:57:05,294
Um, that's Bobby Hogan.<br/>Good guy.

1612
01:57:14,769 --> 01:57:17,071
All right, get ready<br/>for my big <i>F.B.I.</i> moment.

1613
01:57:17,205 --> 01:57:19,440

"Michael Murtaugh."

1615
01:57:29,617 --> 01:57:31,453
- <i>The F.B.I.</i><br/>- Michael Murtaugh.

1616
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:32,853
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Sergio.

1617
01:57:32,987 --> 01:57:34,756
Turn on Channel 7.

1618

<i>F.B.I.</i>

- <i>Norman Fell.</i><br/>- Strong.

"All the Streets Are Silent."

1628

Except when Rick Dalton's<br/>got a fucking shotgun,

1629
01:58:01,817 --> 01:58:03,685
- I'll tell you that.<br/>- You're goddamn right.

<i>...new Ford Cortina.</i>

- Thank you.<br/>- Enjoy, sir.

1633
01:58:29,477 --> 01:58:32,214
Mm-mm-mm-mm... Mmm.

<i>After that Musso<br/>& Frank's lunch meeting,</i>

<i>Marvin did provide Rick<br/>job opportunities</i>

<i>in the Italian film industry.</i>

01:58:41,488 --> 01:58:44,858
Rick Dalton,<br/>Marvin Schwarz here. Hold on.

01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,760
Hennessy X.O on the rocks.

1639
01:58:46,894 --> 01:58:48,362
Yes, Mr. Schwarz.

1640
01:58:48,496 --> 01:58:49,663
Two words.

1641
01:58:49,797 --> 01:58:52,233
Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci.

1642
01:58:52,366 --> 01:58:54,269
N-Nebraska what?

1643
01:58:54,402 --> 01:58:55,404
Sergio who?

1644
01:58:55,537 --> 01:58:57,072
<i>Sergio Corbucci.</i>

1645
01:58:57,205 --> 01:58:58,672
A-and who's that?

1646
01:58:58,806 --> 01:59:00,207
The second-best director

1647
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:02,442
of Spaghetti Westerns<br/>in the whole wide world.

1648
01:59:02,577 --> 01:59:05,881
He's doing a new Western.<br/>It's called <i>Nebraska Jim.</i>

1649
01:59:06,014 --> 01:59:08,450
And because of me,<br/>he's considering you.

1650
01:59:08,582 --> 01:59:11,451
<i>Well, Rick got</i> Nebraska Jim.

1651
01:59:11,586 --> 01:59:13,955
<i>And Rick made a rather<br/>compelling Nebraska Jim,</i>

1652
01:59:14,089 --> 01:59:16,457
<i>existing quite nicely<br/>within Sergio Corbucci's</i>

<i>rogues gallery of antiheroes.</i>

1654
01:59:20,362 --> 01:59:21,930
<i>In Rome,<br/>Rick loved the paparazzi</i>

1655
01:59:22,063 --> 01:59:23,597
<i>and the fuss<br/>they made over him</i>

1656
01:59:23,730 --> 01:59:27,268
<i>and his</i> Nebraska Jim<br/><i>costar Daphna Ben-Cobo.</i>

1657
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:30,906
All right there, paparazzos.<br/>All right. Take it easy.

1658
01:59:31,038 --> 01:59:33,640
<i>He loved the food<br/>so much that during his stay,</i>

1659
01:59:33,774 --> 01:59:35,609
<i>Rick gained<br/>almost 15 pounds.</i>

1660
01:59:35,743 --> 01:59:38,612
<i>But he didn't love the<br/>Italians' way of making movies.</i>

1661
01:59:38,746 --> 01:59:40,414
<i>In fact,<br/>he thought the post-synced,</i>

1662
01:59:40,547 --> 01:59:42,416
<i>"every actor<br/>speaks their own language,"</i>

<i>of European movies<br/>was ridiculous.</i>

01:59:47,089 --> 01:59:49,290
<i>While in Rome,<br/>Marvin plugged Rick</i>

1666
01:59:49,424 --> 01:59:51,193
<i>into three other<br/>Italian productions.</i>

1667
01:59:51,326 --> 01:59:52,859
<i>His second Western was</i>

02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:14,575
<i>ate up a big chunk<br/>of his earnings.</i>

1685
02:01:16,443 --> 02:01:19,513
<i>So as Rick returns to Hollywood<br/>via Pan Am,</i>

1686
02:01:19,647 --> 02:01:21,515
<i>he has four new movies<br/>under his belt,</i>

1692
02:01:35,063 --> 02:01:38,200
<i>Rick was really not sure<br/>about what lay ahead for him.</i>

1693
02:01:40,635 --> 02:01:42,870
<i>Way back in coach,</i>

1694
02:01:43,004 --> 02:01:45,273
<i>working on his<br/>bottomless Bloody Mary,</i>

1695
02:01:45,406 --> 02:01:48,910
<i>Cliff Booth returned<br/>to Los Angeles as well.</i>

1696
02:01:49,044 --> 02:01:50,478
<i>He kept Rick company</i>

1697
02:01:50,612 --> 02:01:53,581
<i>during his entire<br/>six-month stay in Italy.</i>

1698
02:01:53,715 --> 02:01:56,985
<i>However,<br/>as the two men return home,</i>

1699
02:01:57,117 --> 02:01:58,719
<i>they've come<br/>to an understanding.</i>

1700
02:01:58,854 --> 02:02:00,155
Well, here it goes now.

1701
02:02:01,723 --> 02:02:02,690
With the, uh...

1702
02:02:04,192 --> 02:02:05,727
With the new wife, I, uh...

1703
02:02:07,194 --> 02:02:10,197
I just I can't afford you<br/>anymore, Cliff.

1704
02:02:10,331 --> 02:02:13,701
You know? I can barely afford<br/>my own house anymore.

1705
02:02:13,835 --> 02:02:16,504
So I think the plan<br/>is to sell the house

1706
02:02:16,636 --> 02:02:20,407
and buy-buy a condo in-in-in<br/>Toluca Lake, bank the money.

1707
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:23,177
You know, live off it.<br/>That type of thing.

1708
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:26,179
Hopefully,<br/>I score come next pilot season.

1709
02:02:26,313 --> 02:02:27,448
That's a good plan.

1710
02:02:27,581 --> 02:02:29,616
Yeah. You know,

1711
02:02:29,751 --> 02:02:32,120
by then, I'll know<br/>if I have a career or not,

1712
02:02:32,254 --> 02:02:36,256
if I'm a solid Los Angeles<br/>citizen like Eddie O'Brien says,

1713
02:02:36,389 --> 02:02:40,627
or if I'm one step closer<br/>to going back to Missouri.

1714
02:02:40,761 --> 02:02:44,032
So when this whole<br/>European journey is over,

1715
02:02:44,165 --> 02:02:45,233
I think we've, uh...

1716
02:02:46,902 --> 02:02:49,304
We've reached<br/>the end of the trail, Cliff.

1717
02:03:00,447 --> 02:03:02,450
<i>So these last<br/>four Italian flicks,</i>

1718
02:03:02,584 --> 02:03:04,019
<i>after nine years together,</i>

1719
02:03:04,152 --> 02:03:07,255
<i>would be Rick and Cliff's<br/>final rodeo.</i>

1720
02:03:07,389 --> 02:03:10,091
<i>Cliff doesn't have a clue<br/>what he's gonna do.</i>

1721
02:03:10,224 --> 02:03:12,327
<i>The only thing the two men<br/>know of for sure:</i>

1722
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:14,162
<i>Tonight,<br/>Rick and Cliff will have</i>

1723
02:03:14,295 --> 02:03:16,130
<i>a good old-fashioned drunk.</i>

1724
02:03:16,264 --> 02:03:19,300
<i>Both men know, once the plane<br/>touches down in El Segundo,</i>

1725
02:03:19,433 --> 02:03:21,702
<i>it'll be the end of an era<br/>for both of them.</i>

1726
02:03:21,836 --> 02:03:24,338
<i>And when you come to the end<br/>of the line with a buddy</i>

1727
02:03:24,471 --> 02:03:27,175
<i>who is more than a brother<br/>and a little less than a wife,</i>

1728
02:03:27,308 --> 02:03:28,710
<i>getting blind drunk together</i>

1729
02:03:28,843 --> 02:03:31,446
<i>is really the only way<br/>to say farewell.</i>

1730
02:04:28,001 --> 02:04:30,537
Here it is, honey.

1731
02:04:30,671 --> 02:04:32,339
- You like it?<br/>- I love it.

1732
02:04:43,884 --> 02:04:45,086
Where do you want it?

1733
02:04:49,657 --> 02:04:50,858
<i>Hello?</i>

1734
02:04:50,992 --> 02:04:52,394
Hey, it's Joanna and the baby.

1735
02:04:52,527 --> 02:04:54,229
<i>Hi! Come on up.</i>

1736
02:05:00,033 --> 02:05:01,602
Hi!

1737
02:05:01,736 --> 02:05:04,471
Oh, honey. How are you?

1738
02:05:04,604 --> 02:05:06,806
- Oh, my gosh, you're about to pop!<br/>- I know!

1739
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:08,542
- I know.<br/>- Oh!

1740
02:05:08,675 --> 02:05:11,545
- And this is the nursery.<br/>- Oh, my God, Sharon.

1741
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:12,947
- It's perfect.<br/>- Do you love it?

1742
02:05:13,081 --> 02:05:14,281
Little shoes!

1743
02:05:14,415 --> 02:05:15,617
I know.

1744
02:05:17,417 --> 02:05:19,053
I'm about to burst.

1745
02:05:19,187 --> 02:05:21,656
- I think you're gonna be a wonderful mother.<br/>- Thank you.

1746
02:05:24,858 --> 02:05:25,727
Mm!

1747
02:05:38,273 --> 02:05:39,974
- Thanks, Gillian.<br/>- Bye!

1748
02:05:40,108 --> 02:05:41,443

Oh, they're having<br/>a premiere.

Yeah. They're fun.

1764

- This place is always so busy.<br/>- I know.

1765

You're welcome, sir.

No, it's not... It's not<br/>because he just got it done.

02:14:51,492 --> 02:14:53,461
Look, we're really sorry<br/>we disturbed you.

1876
02:14:53,594 --> 02:14:55,529
Look, chief,<br/>you don't belong here.

1877
02:14:55,662 --> 02:14:57,663
Now, take this<br/>mechanical asshole

1878
02:14:57,797 --> 02:15:01,135
and get it<br/>off my fucking street!

1879
02:15:13,013 --> 02:15:14,480
Hey!

1880
02:15:14,613 --> 02:15:17,317
Dennis Hopper!<br/>Move this fucking piece of shit!

1881
02:15:17,451 --> 02:15:19,819
All right. Just give me a moment<br/>to turn it around.

1882
02:15:19,953 --> 02:15:21,688
Drive it backwards, numbnuts,

1883
02:15:21,822 --> 02:15:23,723
but fucking drive it,<br/>and drive it now!

1884
02:15:23,857 --> 02:15:25,426
Okay. Okay. Stop yelling.

1885
02:15:25,559 --> 02:15:27,094
Hold your horses. We're leaving.

1886
02:15:30,997 --> 02:15:34,667
The hell are you looking at,<br/>you little ginger-haired fucker?

1887
02:15:34,801 --> 02:15:38,672
Hey, you come around here again,<br/>I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

1888
02:15:44,377 --> 02:15:45,845
Dirty fucking hippies.

1889
02:15:58,826 --> 02:16:00,527
There in his<br/>fancy fucking house,

1890
02:16:00,661 --> 02:16:02,296
thinking he's handled it.

1891
02:16:02,429 --> 02:16:05,032
But he's seen us.<br/>He's awake. He's alert.

1892
02:16:05,165 --> 02:16:08,402
They're all awake. They're<br/>listening to fucking records.

1893
02:16:08,535 --> 02:16:09,937
Everybody's fucking awake!

1894
02:16:10,069 --> 02:16:11,205
Look!

1895
02:16:11,337 --> 02:16:13,806
- What did Charlie say?<br/>- He said:

1896
02:16:13,940 --> 02:16:17,978
"Go to Terry's old house<br/>and kill everybody in there."

1897
02:16:18,112 --> 02:16:21,781
And you heard him yourself.<br/>He said, "Make it witchy."

1898
02:16:21,915 --> 02:16:24,917
Now, he either said that,

1899
02:16:25,051 --> 02:16:26,786
or I'm a liar.

1900
02:16:28,255 --> 02:16:31,358
Now, are any one of you<br/>calling me a liar?

1901
02:16:32,426 --> 02:16:33,960
Hm?

1902
02:16:34,094 --> 02:16:35,928
How about you?

1903
02:16:36,062 --> 02:16:37,564
Are you calling me a liar?

1904
02:16:39,033 --> 02:16:41,068
No, of course not.

1905
02:16:41,201 --> 02:16:42,068
Good.

1906
02:16:42,202 --> 02:16:43,570
Hold it.

1907
02:16:43,703 --> 02:16:46,139
- Was that Rick Dalton?<br/>- Who?

1908
02:16:46,273 --> 02:16:47,473
The guy from <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1909
02:16:47,606 --> 02:16:49,308
- Who, Jake Cahill?<br/>- Yeah.

1910
02:16:49,443 --> 02:16:52,379
That guy in the robe<br/>was Jake Cahill.

1911
02:16:52,513 --> 02:16:54,748
Wait a minute.<br/>That was fucking Jake Cahill

1912
02:16:54,882 --> 02:16:56,317
that just yelled at me?

1913
02:16:56,450 --> 02:16:58,218
He was older,<br/>but, yeah, I think so.

1914
02:16:58,352 --> 02:16:59,453
So who's this Rick guy?

1915
02:16:59,587 --> 02:17:01,389
Jesus Christ, Sadie,<br/>get it together.

1916
02:17:01,522 --> 02:17:03,722
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill<br/>on a cowboy show

1917
02:17:03,856 --> 02:17:05,224
in the '50s called<br/><i>Bounty Law.</i>

1918
02:17:05,357 --> 02:17:06,659
Fuck you, Katie.

1919
02:17:06,793 --> 02:17:08,161
Sorry I don't know<br/>the name

1920
02:17:08,294 --> 02:17:10,062
of every fascist on TV<br/>in the '50s.

1921
02:17:10,196 --> 02:17:14,633
I can't believe that asshole<br/>in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1922
02:17:14,767 --> 02:17:17,504
When I was a kid,<br/>I had a <i>Bounty Law</i> lunch box.

1923
02:17:17,636 --> 02:17:19,907
That was my favorite<br/>of all my lunch boxes.

1924
02:17:21,275 --> 02:17:23,978
Dig this!

1925
02:17:24,111 --> 02:17:25,979
When we've been having<br/>our trip sessions,

1926
02:17:26,112 --> 02:17:28,649
I've been expanding<br/>on this one idea in my head.

1927
02:17:28,782 --> 02:17:30,283
All right, dig it.

1928
02:17:30,417 --> 02:17:33,886
We all grew up watching TV,<br/>you know what I mean?

1929
02:17:34,019 --> 02:17:35,554
And if you grew up watching TV,

1930
02:17:35,688 --> 02:17:37,558
that means you grew up<br/>watching murder.

1931
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:38,559
Mm-hm.

1932
02:17:38,692 --> 02:17:40,327
Every show on TV

1933
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:43,196
that wasn't <i>I Love Lucy</i><br/>was about murder.

1934
02:17:43,329 --> 02:17:46,366
So my idea is...

1935
02:17:46,499 --> 02:17:48,868
we kill the people<br/>who taught us to kill.

1936
02:17:50,937 --> 02:17:52,505
I mean,<br/>where the fuck are we, man?

1937
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:55,042
We are in fucking Hollywood,<br/>man.

1938
02:17:55,176 --> 02:17:56,977
The people<br/>an entire generation grew up

1939
02:17:57,109 --> 02:17:58,746
watching kill people<br/>live here.

1940
02:17:58,879 --> 02:18:00,847
And they live<br/>in pig-shit fucking luxury.

1941
02:18:00,981 --> 02:18:02,482
I say fuck them.

1942
02:18:02,615 --> 02:18:05,051
I say we cut their cocks off<br/>and make them eat it.

1943
02:18:05,186 --> 02:18:07,355
That's a great idea, Sadie.

1944
02:18:09,790 --> 02:18:11,525
You two ready<br/>to kill some piggies?

1945
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,202
Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

1946
02:18:23,337 --> 02:18:25,705
Sorry, I forgot my knife<br/>in the car.

1947
02:18:25,838 --> 02:18:27,640
Can I go...?<br/>Can I go back and get it?

1948
02:18:28,775 --> 02:18:30,044
- Yeah, sure.<br/>- Okay.

1949
02:18:30,177 --> 02:18:32,145
- Go on. Wait a minute.<br/>- What?

1950
02:18:32,278 --> 02:18:34,381
I locked the car.<br/>You'll need keys to get in.

1951
02:18:37,451 --> 02:18:38,585
Oh.

1952
02:18:38,718 --> 02:18:40,553
Right. Thank you.

1953
02:18:40,687 --> 02:18:43,322
- Okay. I'll be right back.<br/>- Okay.

1954
02:18:43,456 --> 02:18:46,426
- Just hurry up.<br/>- Yeah, just a little minute.

1955
02:18:56,737 --> 02:18:58,372
Oh, that fucking bitch!

1956
02:18:58,505 --> 02:18:59,606
Shh! Calm down.

1957
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:01,409
There's a fucking house<br/>right there.

1958
02:19:02,709 --> 02:19:03,710
What do we do now?

1959
02:19:03,844 --> 02:19:05,278
We do what we came to do.

1960
02:19:05,411 --> 02:19:08,180
And when we're done,<br/>we split up and hitch home.

1961
02:19:08,314 --> 02:19:09,515
Any more questions?

1962
02:19:09,650 --> 02:19:10,885
Hm?

1963
02:19:12,819 --> 02:19:15,589
Okay, pig killers,<br/>let's kill some piggies.

1964
02:19:15,722 --> 02:19:16,924
All right.

1965
02:19:29,635 --> 02:19:31,438
Oh, someone's hungry.

1966
02:19:40,213 --> 02:19:41,315
All right.

1967
02:19:43,249 --> 02:19:45,119
It's feeding time.

1968
02:19:48,122 --> 02:19:49,290
Brandy, couch.

1969
02:19:55,928 --> 02:19:57,297
And don't you mo...

1970
02:20:05,772 --> 02:20:07,707
Oh, man.

1971
02:20:10,443 --> 02:20:11,345
Uh...

1972
02:20:16,817 --> 02:20:18,853
The train<br/>has left the station.

1973
02:20:25,792 --> 02:20:27,027
Bad idea.

1974
02:21:27,653 --> 02:21:29,156
Whoa.

1975
02:22:16,535 --> 02:22:19,671
You go around there,<br/>see if there's a back entrance.

1976
02:22:19,805 --> 02:22:21,641
All right? Go.

1977
02:23:08,654 --> 02:23:09,956
Hey.

1978
02:23:12,992 --> 02:23:17,029
I am doing the best I can<br/>under the circumstances.

1979
02:23:17,163 --> 02:23:19,332
Now, I do not want<br/>to get into it tonight.

1980
02:23:28,775 --> 02:23:31,511
Uh... can I help you?

1981
02:23:37,884 --> 02:23:38,918
Shit.

1982
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,154
How many other people<br/>are here?

1983
02:23:42,288 --> 02:23:45,058
Oh, just the one sleeping<br/>in the back there.

1984
02:23:46,659 --> 02:23:49,395
Go get him and bring him<br/>into the living room.

1985
02:23:49,528 --> 02:23:50,663
What if he says no?

1986
02:23:50,797 --> 02:23:52,265
Don't take no for an answer.

1987
02:23:52,398 --> 02:23:54,935
You're the one with the knife.<br/>Get him in here!

1988
02:23:57,237 --> 02:23:58,739
Hey.

1989
02:24:04,143 --> 02:24:05,945
You are real, right?

1990
02:24:06,079 --> 02:24:08,716
I'm as real as a doughnut,<br/>motherfucker.

1991
02:24:18,591 --> 02:24:20,025
What the fuck?

1992
02:24:26,933 --> 02:24:28,233
Go to the living room.

1993
02:24:28,367 --> 02:24:30,036
What is going on, huh?

1994
02:24:35,107 --> 02:24:36,809
- Go!<br/>- Okay. <i>Si, si.</i>

1995
02:24:39,178 --> 02:24:40,546
Who the fuck's that?

1996
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:41,581
I don't know.

1997
02:24:42,981 --> 02:24:43,916
Francesca.

1998
02:24:50,723 --> 02:24:53,392
Oh. Uh...

1999
02:24:53,526 --> 02:24:55,261
What...?

2000
02:24:55,394 --> 02:24:57,095
Oh, I know you.

2001
02:24:57,230 --> 02:24:58,966
I know all three of you.

2002
02:25:00,266 --> 02:25:02,802
Yeah. Spahn Ranch.

2003
02:25:02,936 --> 02:25:05,606
Spahn Ranch. Yeah. Hoo!

2004
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:11,077
I don't know your name,<br/>but I remember that hair.

2005
02:25:11,211 --> 02:25:14,714
And you, I remember<br/>your white little face.

2006
02:25:14,847 --> 02:25:16,749
And you were on a horsie.

2007
02:25:16,883 --> 02:25:18,618
Yeah.

2008
02:25:18,750 --> 02:25:21,820
Uh... You are...?

2009
02:25:21,954 --> 02:25:23,789
I'm the devil,

2010
02:25:23,922 --> 02:25:27,260
and I'm here to do<br/>the devil's business.

2011
02:25:29,963 --> 02:25:33,600
Nah, it was dumber than that.<br/>Something like... Rex.

2012
02:25:33,732 --> 02:25:35,736
- God, shoot him, Tex!<br/>- Tex.

2013
02:25:39,239 --> 02:25:40,340
Fuck!

2014
02:25:55,454 --> 02:25:56,856
Son of a bitch!

2015
02:26:35,328 --> 02:26:36,230
Hey, you.

2016
02:26:39,297 --> 02:26:41,435
How dare you come into my house,<br/>motherfucker!

2017
02:27:07,526 --> 02:27:09,194
Wow, man.

2018
02:28:02,382 --> 02:28:03,483
What the fuck?

2019
02:28:04,983 --> 02:28:06,519
Jesus Christ.

2020
02:29:23,295 --> 02:29:24,697
Holy shit.

2021
02:29:27,767 --> 02:29:30,569
Francesca! Francesca, honey!

2022
02:29:49,821 --> 02:29:51,790
<i>10,000 block, Cielo Drive.</i>

2023
02:29:51,924 --> 02:29:55,127
Around what time was it<br/>when you confronted the intruder?

2024
02:29:55,260 --> 02:29:57,095
It was about midnight.

2025
02:29:57,230 --> 02:29:58,364
- Around midnight?<br/>- Yeah.

2026
02:29:58,498 --> 02:30:00,065
How do you know<br/>it was midnight?

2027
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:03,436
Well, I was, uh...<br/>I was in the kitchen.

2028
02:30:03,569 --> 02:30:06,773
You know, I was<br/>making margaritas, and, uh...

2029
02:30:06,907 --> 02:30:08,607
I heard the sound<br/>of a noisy muffler.

2030
02:30:08,740 --> 02:30:10,409
I looked up at the clock.

2031
02:30:10,543 --> 02:30:12,545
It said... The kitchen clock<br/>said midnight.

2032
02:30:12,677 --> 02:30:14,212
Twelve o'clock exactly?

2033
02:30:14,347 --> 02:30:16,449
I mean,<br/>it could have been 12:05.

2034
02:30:16,581 --> 02:30:18,917
- Something like that.<br/>- And you didn't see them again

2035
02:30:19,052 --> 02:30:21,153
until the woman attacked you<br/>in the pool.

2036
02:30:21,286 --> 02:30:23,222
No, no.

2037
02:30:23,356 --> 02:30:25,425
So,<br/>what did these perpetrators do?

2038
02:30:25,559 --> 02:30:28,094
Perpetrators?<br/>They were hippie assholes.

2039
02:30:28,227 --> 02:30:31,665
Two of them burst through<br/>the front door there,

2040
02:30:31,797 --> 02:30:36,102
and the guy hippie<br/>said he was the devil.

2041
02:30:36,236 --> 02:30:38,938
And he said, "I'm here to...

2042
02:30:39,071 --> 02:30:41,174
do some devil shit."

2043
02:30:41,306 --> 02:30:43,909
Or...<br/>That's not verbatim, but...

2044
02:30:44,043 --> 02:30:46,813
- "Some devil shit"?<br/>- Yeah, "devil shit."

2045
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:02,996
And away we go.

2046
02:31:06,198 --> 02:31:08,300
Hey. Wait a minute.<br/>Wait a minute.

2047
02:31:08,434 --> 02:31:10,069
What hospital you going to,<br/>Cliff?

2048
02:31:10,203 --> 02:31:11,437
I'll meet you there, huh?

2049
02:31:11,570 --> 02:31:13,939
You don't want to meet me<br/>in no hospital.

2050
02:31:14,072 --> 02:31:15,908
Why don't you go take care<br/>of your lady.

2051
02:31:16,042 --> 02:31:18,911
Hey, she just took<br/>five fucking sleeping pills.

2052
02:31:19,044 --> 02:31:20,813
She'll be asleep<br/>till Columbus Day.

2053
02:31:20,946 --> 02:31:23,415
These guys will probably<br/>have to come out here again

2054
02:31:23,549 --> 02:31:25,785
- just to wake her ass up.<br/>- Hey, I'm not gonna die.

2055
02:31:25,918 --> 02:31:27,754
I may get a limp,<br/>but I ain't gonna die.

2056
02:31:27,888 --> 02:31:29,822
- It's not my time yet, man.<br/>- All right.

2057
02:31:29,955 --> 02:31:32,291
So no use waiting<br/>in some waiting room.

2058
02:31:32,425 --> 02:31:35,493
Why don't you go lie naked<br/>with that fine creature.

2059
02:31:35,627 --> 02:31:37,129
Come visit me tomorrow.

2060
02:31:37,263 --> 02:31:39,499
Bring bagels.

2061
02:31:39,632 --> 02:31:42,001
You want to do something for me,<br/>check on Brandy.

2062
02:31:42,134 --> 02:31:43,969
She may be a little shook up<br/>after that.

2063
02:31:44,103 --> 02:31:46,473
- She may want to sleep with you.<br/>- Are you kidding me?

2064
02:31:46,606 --> 02:31:48,440
She's sleeping<br/>with Francesca right now.

2065
02:31:48,575 --> 02:31:50,475
You might never get her back.<br/>Ha, ha.

2066
02:31:50,609 --> 02:31:52,310
- We got to go.<br/>- All right, then, Cliff.

2067
02:31:52,445 --> 02:31:54,814
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

2068
02:31:58,284 --> 02:31:59,752
Hey. Hey.

2069
02:32:03,722 --> 02:32:05,491
You're a good friend, Cliff.

2070
02:32:06,992 --> 02:32:08,160
I try.

2071
02:32:40,559 --> 02:32:41,461
Hello?

2072
02:32:43,428 --> 02:32:44,296
Hey.

2073
02:32:44,429 --> 02:32:45,463
I'm Jay Sebring.

2074
02:32:45,597 --> 02:32:47,632
I'm a friend of the Polanskis.

2075
02:32:47,766 --> 02:32:50,303
You're Rick Dalton,<br/>right?

2076
02:32:50,436 --> 02:32:53,973
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.

2077
02:32:54,106 --> 02:32:55,907
- Live next door.<br/>- Oh, I know.

2078
02:32:56,042 --> 02:32:58,678
I tease Sharon that she lives<br/>next door to Jake Cahill.

2079
02:32:58,811 --> 02:33:00,779
If she ever wants to put<br/>a bounty on Roman,

2080
02:33:00,912 --> 02:33:02,547
she just has to go next door,<br/>right?

2081
02:33:04,383 --> 02:33:06,084
No shit.

2082
02:33:06,219 --> 02:33:08,553
What the fuck happened?

2083
02:33:08,687 --> 02:33:11,222
Oh, th-these fucking<br/>hippie weirdos,

2084
02:33:11,356 --> 02:33:13,593
they-they-they<br/>broke into my house.

2085
02:33:13,725 --> 02:33:16,362
What do you mean, like,<br/>trying to rob you?

2086
02:33:16,495 --> 02:33:18,297
We don't know what the fuck<br/>they wanted.

2087
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:20,131
Were they robbing me?<br/>I don't know.

2088
02:33:20,266 --> 02:33:22,368
Were they freaking out<br/>on some bummer trip?

2089
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:25,772
Who knows? But they tried<br/>to kill my wife and my buddy.

2090
02:33:25,904 --> 02:33:29,275
- Jesus Christ. Are you serious?<br/>- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

2091
02:33:29,409 --> 02:33:33,079
Now, my buddy and his dog<br/>killed two of them, and then...

2092
02:33:33,213 --> 02:33:36,215
Well, shit.<br/>I-I torched the last one.

2093
02:33:36,348 --> 02:33:38,084
- "Torched"?<br/>- Yeah.

2094
02:33:38,216 --> 02:33:40,620
I burnt her ass to a crisp.

2095
02:33:40,752 --> 02:33:43,623
- How'd you do that?<br/>- Well, believe it or not, I...

2096
02:33:43,757 --> 02:33:45,957
I got a flamethrower<br/>in my toolshed.

2097
02:33:46,091 --> 02:33:48,595
Oh, from <i>The Fourteen Fists</i><br/><i>of McCluskey.</i>

2098
02:33:48,728 --> 02:33:50,463
Yeah!

2099
02:33:50,597 --> 02:33:52,064
Yeah. Yeah.

2100
02:33:52,197 --> 02:33:53,732
That's... That's the one.

2101
02:33:53,865 --> 02:33:57,068
Yeah, it still works too.<br/>Thank God.

2102
02:33:57,202 --> 02:33:58,504
Is everybody okay?

2103
02:33:58,638 --> 02:34:01,106
Well, the fucking hippies<br/>aren't,

2104
02:34:01,240 --> 02:34:02,976
that's for goddamn sure.

2105
02:34:03,108 --> 02:34:04,642
Yeah. But I'm fine.

2106
02:34:04,776 --> 02:34:06,477
You know, my wife's fine.

2107
02:34:06,612 --> 02:34:09,314
We're just a little shook up,<br/>is all.

2108
02:34:09,448 --> 02:34:12,884
- Oh, my God, that's terrifying.<br/>- Yeah.

2109
02:34:13,018 --> 02:34:15,720
<i>Jay,<br/>honey, is everything all right?</i>

2110
02:34:15,855 --> 02:34:17,823
Everything's okay now, honey.

2111
02:34:17,956 --> 02:34:20,693
But some hippies<br/>broke into the house next door.

2112
02:34:20,826 --> 02:34:22,629
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

2113
02:34:22,761 --> 02:34:24,631
<i>Oh, that's terrifying.</i>

2114
02:34:24,764 --> 02:34:26,331
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2115
02:34:26,465 --> 02:34:30,336
I'm talking to your next-door<br/>neighbor about it right now.

2116
02:34:30,469 --> 02:34:31,871
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

2117
02:34:33,639 --> 02:34:36,008
Yeah, that's me. Heh.

2118
02:34:36,141 --> 02:34:38,510
<i>Oh. Well, hello, neighbor.</i>

2119
02:34:39,612 --> 02:34:41,347
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2120
02:34:41,480 --> 02:34:44,417
Yes, Sharon,<br/>everybody's fine.

2121
02:34:44,551 --> 02:34:46,686
<i>Are you okay?</i>

2122
02:34:48,221 --> 02:34:50,756
Well, yes, I am.<br/>Thank you for asking that.

2123
02:34:50,890 --> 02:34:53,259
<i>Rick,<br/>would you like to come up to the house</i>

2124
02:34:53,391 --> 02:34:55,861
<i>for a drink<br/>and meet my other friends?</i>

2125
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:05,169
Yeah, sure.<br/>Thank you.

2126
02:35:05,303 --> 02:35:07,906
<i>Oh, hooray! Great.<br/>I'll buzz you up.</i>

2127
02:35:19,618 --> 02:35:20,519
Come on.

2128
02:35:24,290 --> 02:35:26,425
- Hey, nice to meet you, huh?<br/>- Yeah.

2129
02:35:26,558 --> 02:35:27,993
- Jay Sebring.<br/>- Hey, pleasure.

2130
02:35:28,126 --> 02:35:29,161
- Yeah.<br/>- Pleasure, Jay.

2131
02:35:29,294 --> 02:35:30,428
Pleasure's all mine.

2132
02:35:30,562 --> 02:35:32,363
Sounds like you had<br/>a hell of a night.

2133
02:38:51,364 --> 02:38:53,099
Hi. This is Rick Dalton,

2134
02:38:53,231 --> 02:38:55,733
better known as bounty hunter<br/>Jake Cahill,

2135
02:38:55,867 --> 02:38:59,270
speaking on behalf<br/>of Red Apple cigarettes.

2136
02:38:59,403 --> 02:39:02,507
Now, I smoke Red Apples.<br/>Been smoking them for years.

2137
02:39:02,641 --> 02:39:04,976
But since the Red Apple<br/>tobacco company's

2138
02:39:05,111 --> 02:39:07,579
been around since 1862,

2139
02:39:07,713 --> 02:39:10,917
<i>you'll see Jake Cahill<br/>smoke Red Apple too.</i>

2140
02:39:11,050 --> 02:39:14,152
<i>Now, back in Jake's day,<br/>Red Apple came in a pouch,</i>

2141
02:39:14,285 --> 02:39:16,120
<i>and he had to roll his own.</i>

2142
02:39:16,255 --> 02:39:19,158
But today, Red Apple<br/>comes factory-rolled.

2143
02:39:19,291 --> 02:39:22,894
For the best drag<br/>with the best tobacco flavor,

2144
02:39:23,028 --> 02:39:24,929
with less burn on your throat

2145
02:39:25,063 --> 02:39:27,499
than any other<br/>non-filtered cigarette.

2146
02:39:33,873 --> 02:39:35,174
Mm!

2147
02:39:36,942 --> 02:39:39,478
Now, that's the way<br/>a cigarette should taste.

2148
02:39:39,612 --> 02:39:40,479
Hm.

2149
02:39:40,613 --> 02:39:43,448
Better drag, more flavor,

2150
02:39:43,581 --> 02:39:44,983
less throat burn.

2151
02:39:47,385 --> 02:39:49,988
That's the Red Apple way.

2152
02:39:50,123 --> 02:39:53,793
So look for this life-size<br/>standee of me, Jake Cahill,

2153
02:39:53,926 --> 02:39:57,496
wherever fine Red Apple tobacco<br/>products are sold.

2154
02:39:57,630 --> 02:40:00,832
Take a bite<br/>and feel all right.

2155
02:40:00,965 --> 02:40:04,268
Take a bite of<br/>a Red Apple.

2156
02:40:04,402 --> 02:40:05,804
Tell them Jake sent you.

2157
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:10,141
And cut.

2158
02:40:10,275 --> 02:40:12,077
This cigarette tastes like<br/>fucking shit.

2159
02:40:12,211 --> 02:40:13,979
And, by the way,<br/>who chose this photo?

2160
02:40:14,113 --> 02:40:15,546
I have a double chin.<br/>All right?

2161
02:40:15,680 --> 02:40:16,982
Nobody notices that crap?

2162
02:40:22,843 --> 02:40:27,843
