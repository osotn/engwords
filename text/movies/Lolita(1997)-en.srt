2
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,970
She was Lo. Plain Lo in the morning.

3
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,090
Standing four feet ten in one sock.

4
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,260
She was Lola in slacks.

5
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,470
She was Dolly at school.

6
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,430
She was Dolores on the dotted line.

7
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,090
In my arms, she was always...

8
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,260
..Lolita.

9
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,970
Light of my life.

10
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,140
Fire of my loins.

11
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,890
My sin.

12
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,640
My soul.

13
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Lolita.

14
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,890
But there might have been
no Lolita at all...

15
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,050
..had I not first met Annabel.

16
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,840
We were both 14.

17
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,300
Whatever happens to a boy
during the summer he's 14...

18
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,590
..can mark him for life.

19
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,050
That hotel you see, the Mirana,...

20
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,800
..that belonged to us.

21
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,880
She wanted to be a nurse.

22
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
I wanted to be a spy.

23
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,170
All at once we were madly,
hopelessly in love.

24
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,460
Four months later, she died of typhus.

25
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,260
The shock of her death
froze something in me.

26
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,420
The child I loved was gone.

27
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,630
But I kept looking for her...

28
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,590
..long after I'd left
my own childhood behind.

29
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,960
The poison was in the wound, you see.

30
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,130
And the wound wouldn't heal.

31
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,050
I probably should have
joined the priesthood.

32
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,630
Instead, I accepted a teaching post
at Beardsley College in America.

33
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,880
I had a summer free
before the Fall semester.

34
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,920
I thought I'd finish
a textbook I was working on.

35
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,290
A survey of French literature
for American students.

36
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,590
I took my advance...

37
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,670
..and went to live at the house of friends
of my late uncle's, the McCoos,...

38
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,250
..in the New England town of Ramsdale.

39
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,130
But on arriving, I found
that it was no longer there.

40
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,630
But a friend of Mrs McCoo,...

41
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,880
..a widow, Mrs Charlotte Haze,...

42
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,830
..agreed to accommodate me.

43
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,040
- Goddamn dog!

44
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,960
One minute. Something's burnin'.

45
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,580
Lord have mercy!

46
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,750
Mrs Haze'll be down in one.

47
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,330
ls that Professor Humbert,
Louise? Tell him I'll be down in one.

48
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,330
She'll be down in one!

49
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,000
Monsieur Humbert.

50
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,080
Uh, yes.

51
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,250
Mrs Haze, is it?

52
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,420
Charlotte.

53
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,170
I am so pleased
to make your acquaintance.

54
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,750
Frank McCoo told me all about
your scholarly pursuits.

55
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,960
I myself just cherish the French tongue.

56
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,290
Um... I wonder, could l...

57
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,290
Mm. Come in.

58
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,460
Harold and l, the late Mr Haze,...

59
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,580
..we simply adored Mexico.

60
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,000
The whole idea
of a culture that sophisticated.

61
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,410
And we think of them as primitive.

62
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,580
I mean, look at us!

63
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,120
Indeed, yes.

64
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,790
Upstairs.

65
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,040
I and Lo have our rooms just there.

66
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,450
And this is your room.

67
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,870
Space for a desk, anything you want.

68
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,540
And at $20 a month,
you can't beat the price.

69
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,790
And here's the bathroom.
It's a bit of a mess.

70
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,540
And this is the kitchen.

71
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,660
Now, if you have any special
food needs, you just say.

72
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,410
I don't know if Ramsdale can provide you
with foie gras, like you're used to.

73
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,080
What's that?

74
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,660
Uh... timetable. For when I um...

75
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,290
I was hoping I wouldn't have to,
but I think I've got to go back to New York.

76
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,450
- Oh, you're not too favourably impressed.
- No... There's a Baudelaire conference...

77
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,950
This is not a neat household,
but you would be very comfortable here.

78
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,950
Very comfortable indeed.

79
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,160
Don't say no until you've seen the piazza.

80
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,330
Come.

81
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Well, I call it the piazza.

82
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,120
It's so much work
to keep it healthy and green.

83
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,330
It's a life's work.

84
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,950
That's my Lo.

85
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,490
And these are my lilies.

86
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
I love lilies.

87
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,120
- Lily's a nice name, don't you think?
- Beautiful.

88
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,620
Beautiful!

89
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,240
How much did you say the room was?

90
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,650
A normal man,...

91
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,780
..given a group photograph
of schoolgirls...

92
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,740
..and asked to point out
the loveliest one,...

93
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,490
..will not necessarily choose
the nymphet among them.

94
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
You have to be an artist,...

95
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:09,820
..a madman, full of shame
and melancholy and despair,...

96
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,200
..in order to recognise
the little deadly demon among the others.

97
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,650
She stands...

98
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,200
..unrecognised by them,...

99
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,030
..unconscious herself
of her fantastic power.

100
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,610
- See you later, alligator.
- After a while, crocodile!

101
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,030
- Real soon, Daniel Boone.
- Get fucked, Daffy Duck.

102
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,570

there's no sun up in the sky

103
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,820


104
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,650


105
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
You woke me up.

106
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,400
- Sorry.

107
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,860
I'll stop.

108
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,690
Dolores!
Have you made your bed?

109
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,480
No, I have not made my bed.

110
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,440
I asked you to make your bed, didn't l?

111
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,310
No. You asked me if I'd made my bed.

112
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,190
Make your bed.

113
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,350
- Now!

114
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,600
I long for some terrific disaster.

115
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,730
Earthquake.

116
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Spectacular explosion.

117
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,850
Make your bed!

118
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,980
Her mother instantly eliminated.

119
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,310
Along with everybody else
for miles around.

120
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Lolita...

121
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
..in my arms.

122
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,180
I'm sleepy today.

123
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,230
Me too.

124
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,230
Have you been having trouble sleeping?

125
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,060
You can't imagine.

126
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,680
Am I getting a zit?

127
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,270
What?

128
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,430
Do you see a pimple on my chin?

129
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,430
You look absolutely perfect to me.

130
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,060
Wanna see my chin wobble?

131
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,010
OK.

132
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Humbert!

133
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,720
Humbert...

134
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,640
Is she keeping you up?
135
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,390
I beg your pardon?

136
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,310
No!

137
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,800
No. No, I'm...

138
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,050
No.

139
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,350
Well, it's probably just a 24-hour bug.

140
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,930
He was looking forward to meeting you.

141
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,350
Has anybody seen my other sneaker?!

142
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,600
Your breakfast, Professor Humbert.

143
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,260
Don't tell Mother, but I ate all your bacon.

144
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,840
- Dolores, that was Mrs Farlow.
- So?

145
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,220
Rose has a temperature
and can't go to Hourglass Lake.

146
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,680
- Oh, yeah?
- Do not use that tone with me!

147
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,720
Are you ready for church?

148
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,470
I'm not going to that disgusting church.

149
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,680
- Young lady...
- No picnic, no church.

150
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,680
That is fine with me.
It is your conscience.

151
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,840
I want your room spick-and-span
when I get home.

152
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,970
- And wash your hair, young lady.
- I did wash it!

153
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,140
- When?
- A couple of months ago.

154
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,970
I could be a dancer.

155
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
That's a major option.

156
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,970
Cos I do have a natural grace.

157
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,470
- You know. A kind of sad beauty.
- Sort of sad is right.

158
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,510
I'd like to see you dance sometime.

159
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,170
Little girls always want to be
ballerinas, don't they?

160
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
I know I did.

161
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,720
But I was - how should I put it? -
a tad too... plump?

162
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,970
- Is that the right word?
- Yes.

163
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
I'll get more Vouvray.

164
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,920
Make her take us
to Hourglass Lake tomorrow.

165
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,380
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

166
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,550
She'll do anything you say.

167
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,880
She's getting a thing about you.

168
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,420
Whisper, whisper.

169
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,960
What are you two so cosy about?

170
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,800
Um... Did I ever tell you both that...

171
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,010
..l was once a...

172
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,170
..that I was once a... um...

173
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,800
Uh... that l...
I was once a cook in the North Pole?

174
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,630
- A cook?
- Well, not exactly a cook.

175
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,760
I opened a few cans.

176
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,090
It was a weather expedition.
And I shot a polar bear.

177
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,250
- No!
- Well, I didn't hit it.

178
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,510
Why shoot a polar bear?
That's a lousy thing to do.

179
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,260
Because I found it...

180
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,960
..with its face - listen to this -
in the ice-cream mixer.

181
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,170
I couldn't let that pass
because we lived off ice cream.

182
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,840
You're out of your gourd, Humpy.

183
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,880
Will you stop fidgeting with the doll?

184
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,210
And now we all think
that Lo should go to bed.

185
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Lo?

186
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,540
What do you mean "we", paleface?

187
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,000
So, as I was saying, there I was
with my white polar-bear gun...

188
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,710
-..to blend in.

189
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
It's for me!

190
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,170
Hello?

191
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
- No, I'm sorry. She's busy.
- I hope you will forgive her bad manners.

192
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,130
- Now what?!

193
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,840
Look! It's my modern dance creation!

194
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,670
Dolores Haze, turn that music down!

195
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:35,670
She is a pest. Just slap her hard
if she interferes with your meditations.

196
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,210
Psst!

197
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,630
Hum...

198
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,210
Hum, do you know that I have
one most ambitious dream?

199
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,710
To get a hold of a real trained maid...

200
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,210
..like that German girl
that the Talbots spoke of...

201
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,380
..and have her live in the house.

202
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,540
- No room.
- Oh, chéri, chéri.

203
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,750
You underestimate the possibilities
of our humble household.

204
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,000
We'd put her in Lo's room.

205
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,710
I intended to turn that hole
into a guest room anyway.

206
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
But where would Lo sleep?

207
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,330
Little Lo does not enter the picture at all.

208
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,460
Little Lo goes straight from camp
to a good boarding school...

209
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,580
..with strict discipline
and some sound religious training.

210
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,670
I won't go!

211
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,120
I want all of these name tags
sewn on your clothes by tomorrow.

212
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,670
I don't want to go.

213
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,460
I didn't ask your opinion!

214
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,040
I don't want to go and you can't make me.

215
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,370
Look, we all think it's a good idea.

216
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,330
Professor Humbert thinks it's a good idea,
I think it's a good idea, and you are going!

217
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,370
Double-crosser!

218
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,750
Ow!

219
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,790
I asked you to put that suitcase
in the car an hour ago!

220
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,330
Louise, thank you so much
for helping the poor child.

221
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,660
Goddamn it! Dolores, I told you
to put this lunch basket in the back seat!

222
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,040
Why always tell me to do everything?

223
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,410
I'm the one that won't be eating it.

224
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,830
Louise! Brussels sprouts
and meat loaf for dinner.

225
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,080
- All right. Drive careful.
- Thank you. Let's go!

226
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,250
- Bye, my baby.
- Bye, Louise.

227
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,910
- You be good. I'm gonna miss you.
- Agh!

228
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,370
Dolores!

229
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,660
Let's go!

230
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,620
Speed it up!

231
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,540
Get in the car!

232
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,250
Now what?! That child!

233
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,040
- Louise, maybe tenderloin.
- That'd be good.

234
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
I'm waiting!

235
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,280
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...

236
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,870
..not to make me wait in the car.

237
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,330
If you weren't going to camp,
I would ground you.

238
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,370
Mr Humble!

239
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,410
These damn stairs
are gonna be the death of me.

240
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,330
Mr Humble!

241
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,200
Mr Humble!

242
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,370
Mr Humble?

243
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,410
I have something for you.

244
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,740
Oh, yes.

245
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,240
I'm leaving, but I'll be back later.

246
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,110
What the hell he doin' in there?

247
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,030
This is a confession.

248
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
I love you.

249
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,700
I'm a passionate and lonely woman...

250
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,870
..and you are the love of my life.

251
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,030
Now you know.

252
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,610
So please, destroy this letter and go.

253
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,110
I shall return by dinner time
and you must be gone by then.

254
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,360
You see, chéri, if l found you at home,...

255
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,030
..the fact of your remaining
would mean only one thing.

256
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,360
That you want me as much as I do you,
as a lifelong mate,...

257
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:38,450
..and that you are ready to link up
your life with mine for ever and ever...

258
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,450
..and be a father to my little girl.

259
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,320
Two weeks later,
we were married in a simple ceremony.

260
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,650
Big Haze made sure little Haze
was not in attendance.

261
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Mm. This is bliss.

262
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,780
This is heaven on earth. Isn't it, Hump?

263
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,950
Mm.

264
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,740
Are you working on your book?

265
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,900
Yes.

266
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,240
Oh, a secret drawer. What's in there?

267
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,070
Locked-up love letters.

268
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,570
Where's the key?

269
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,820
Hidden.

270
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,150
"I'm in the Mood for Love")

271
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,690
During the six weeks
we'd been married,...

272
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,360
..l successfully avoided
most of my husbandly duties.

273
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,440
Throughout July, I'd been offering
Charlotte various sleeping tablets,...

274
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,780
..which she gobbled down happily.

275
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,940
She was a great taker of pills.

276
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,320


277
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,860


278
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,280


279
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,570


280
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,320


281
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,070


282
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,690


283
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,570
The last dose I had tried
had knocked her out for four hours.

284
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,780
But that was not enough
to guarantee me an undisturbed night.

285
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,730
Hum...

286
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,570
At last!

287
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,020
Mm.

288
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,150
I think I must be immune.

289
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,360
Wh... What would you give me
if you wanted to uh...

290
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,270
..to knock out...

291
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,150
..say, a cow?

292
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,900
J- Just for... seven or eight hours.

293
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,650
So that...

294
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,820
..you know, the cow... would stay asleep?

295
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,810
Even if you were
tossing and turning next to it.

296
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,480
Well...

297
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,020
Why don't you...

298
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,770
..try these?

299
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,520
They're new.

300
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,520
My wife takes them and...

301
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,190
..l don't hear a peep out of her
all night long.

302
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Sounds like just the thing.

303
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,610
I'm home!

304
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,900
Hello?

305
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,690
Hello?

306
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,600
Hello?

307
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,810
"The Haze woman."

308
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
"The fat cow"?

309
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,810
"The obnoxious mamma"?

310
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,100
Well, the "old stupid Haze woman"
is no longer your dupe.

311
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,650
Charlotte!

312
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,310
You're a monster.

313
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,940
- You're a despicable, criminal monster.

314
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,770
- Now...
- If you come near me I'll scream!

315
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,020
- Let me just...
- Get away from me!

316
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,310
I'm leaving tonight.

317
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,810
You can keep this house. I don't care.

318
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:06,390
But you will never see
that miserable brat ever again.

319
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,890
Now get out of my sight!

320
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,730
Charlotte, you mustn't...

321
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,890
You mustn't ruin our lives.

322
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,310
That's...

323
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,890
That's just... That's just a fragment of...

324
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,180
..a novel I'm writing.

325
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,430
I used your name on those...

326
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,850
..just for... convenience.

327
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,270
I'll get us a drink.

328
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,680
A nice stiff drink
will clear both our heads.

329
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,600
Charlotte, I made us a nice stiff drink!

330
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,850
Yes?

331
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,350
But that's ridiculous.

332
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:37,100
There's this man on the phone
saying you've been killed, Charlotte.

333
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,350
Charlotte?

334
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,640
I'm... I'm sorry.

335
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,100
Stand back, please.

336
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,260
Where's my wife?

337
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,510
- Are you Mr Humbert?
- I am.

338
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,550
She ran right in front of me.

339
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,890
I... I didn't even see her.

340
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,930
Sir?

341
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm sorry, sir.

342
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,430
Is this Mrs Humbert?

343
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,390
Sir,...

344
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,590
..is this Mrs Humbert?

345
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,640
Oh, God...

346
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,100
Oh, God... Oh, God!

347
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,800
She was walking to the mailbox.

348
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,260
She was going to mail these letters.

349
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,590
I'm sorry.

350
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,760
Thank you.

351
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,840
I'll go and... lie down, officer.

352
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,130
- Will that be all right?
- You go right ahead, sir.

353
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,260
I'll just be across in the house if you...

354
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,420
Is that the Enchanted Hunters Hotel?

355
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,590
Yes. This is Mr Humbert.

356
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,710
Tomorrow night.

357
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Just the one night, please.

358
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,760
Yes, a room with twin beds.

359
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,460
For two.
Well, one and a half people, really.

360
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,500
It's just for me and my...

361
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,420
..my short... my small daughter.

362
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,500
She should be here any minute.

363
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,750
I sent Charlie for her over at the barn.

364
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,250
- Who's Charlie?
- Come on, come on.

365
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:38,090
It's such a pleasure to watch
our young people make friends.

366
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,960
- So uh... who is this Charlie?
- Here she is.

367
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,420
Hi, Dad!

368
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,920


369
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,090


370
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,670


371
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,500
- How's Mum?
- Well... The doctors aren't quite sure.

372
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,920
It's something abdominal.

373
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,750
Abominable?

374
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,920
Abdominal.

375
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,210
She's in a special hospital
over in Lepingville.

376
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,040
So... I thought we'd... we'd...

377
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,580
..go over to Briceland, ...

378
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,500
..spend the night there and...
visit the hospital tomorrow.

379
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,500
Or the next day.

380
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,920
So, did you have a good time at camp?

381
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,870
Mm-hm.

382
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,210
You know, I missed you.

383
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,370
I missed you a lot.

384
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,120
Well, I didn't miss you.

385
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,460
In fact, I've been
revoltingly unfaithful to you.

386
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,120
But so what? Cos you don't care
about me any more anyway.

387
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,290
Why do you think I don't care about you?

388
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,500
Well, you haven't
kissed me yet, have you?

389
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,290
Oh!

390
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,040
- Uh, I'm sorry, officer.
- See a blue sedan, same make as yours?

391
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,160
- They might have passed you at the turn.
- Blue sedan? No, I don't think... agh!

392
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:54,160
- We didn't see a blue sedan.
- No, I don't think we did.

393
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,750
Are you sure it was blue?
I saw one that was more purple.

394
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,040
Or maybe it was more red.

395
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,290
All right, OK. Thank you.

396
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,910
- Thank you!

397
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,410
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

398
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,120
Wow! Looks swank!

399
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,490


400
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,620


401
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,660
Good evening. I have a reservation
in the name of Humbert.

402
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,830
Twin-bedded room.

403
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,660
I called last night.

404
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,490
- Two people.
- Oh!

405
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,410
I'm sorry, Mr Humbug.

406
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,910
I held the room with the twin beds for you
till 6.30, but I didn't hear from you.

407
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:06,540
We hold till 6.30. And with the flower
show and Glory of Christ convention...

408
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,950
My name is not Humbug. It's Herbert.

409
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,030
Humbert.

410
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,660
Just put us in any room. Put a cot in
for my daughter. She's very tired.

411
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,490
Perhaps I could put you in room 342.
It has a double bed.

412
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,120
I expect we'll manage.
My wife may be turning up later.

413
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,990
Please sign here, mister.

414
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,490
It's a nice dog, huh?

415
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,660
I love dogs.

416
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,700
Well, that's my dog.

417
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,580
He likes you.

418
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,280
Doesn't like everybody.

419
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,530
Who does he like?

420
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,870
He can smell when people are sweet.

421
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,780
He likes sweet people.

422
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,450
Nice young people.

423
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,620
Like you.

424
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,530
Here we are.

425
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,740
Thanks very much.

426
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,860
Wait a sec. You mean
we're sleeping in one room?

427
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,860
With one bed?

428
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,360
I've asked them to send up a cot,...

429
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,530
..which I'll use, if you like.

430
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,570
You're crazy.

431
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,280
Why, my darling?

432
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,450
Because, my darling,...

433
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:09,160
..when my darling mother finds out,
she'll divorce you and strangle me.

434
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,820
Lo,...

435
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,990
..listen to me a moment.

436
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,110
For all practical purposes,
I am your father,...

437
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,700
..and I'm responsible for your welfare.

438
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,400
Now, we're not rich.

439
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:26,200
So when we travel, we-we're sure to be...
I mean, we'll be thrown together.

440
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,820
Sometimes.

441
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,940
Two people sharing
the same hotel room...

442
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,030
..are bound to... enter into a...

443
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,360
How can I put it? Into a kind of um...

444
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,610
The word is "incest".

445
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,480
I feel like we're grown-ups.

446
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,610
Me too.

447
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,150
We get to do whatever we want, right?

448
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,280
Whatever we want.

449
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,030
Well, now.

450
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,990
Who had the pie?

451
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,030
Me.

452
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,240
Whaddaya think? Are they me?

453
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,610
- Don't look now.
- Why?

454
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,780
The guy over in the corner.

455
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,030
Don't look! He was staring at us.

456
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,570
Don't you think that guy
looks exactly like Quilty?

457
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,190
What, the dentist?

458
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,940
Of course not. His brother.

459
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:44,190
The writer Quilty.
You know, he writes the plays.

460
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,610
The smoking guy.
He smokes the Dromes in the ad.

461
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,940
We saw him in the lobby with his dog.

462
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,940
If I tell you how naughty I was at camp,...

463
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,730
..you promise you won't be mad?

464
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,730
Tell me later.

465
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,520
I want you to go to bed.

466
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,320
I'll go downstairs while you...

467
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,190
When I come up, I want you to be asleep.

468
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,560
All right?

469
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,360
I've been such a disgusting girl.

470
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,520
Just let me tell you.

471
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,690
Tell me tomorrow.

472
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,900
I'm going to go now. All right?

473
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,520
Good night, Dad.

474
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,360
Night-night.

475
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,150
Gentlewomen of the jury,...

476
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,770
..if my happiness could have talked,...

477
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:31,940
..it would have filled that hotel
with a deafening roar.

478
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,810
My only regret...

479
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,230
..is that I did not immediately deposit
key number 342 at the office...

480
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,020
..and leave the town, the country,
the planet, that very night.

481
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:50,270
The Lord knows all,
the Lord sees all, the Lord forgives all.

482
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,480
Where the devil did you get her?

483
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:24,390
- I beg your pardon?
- I said the weather's getting better.

484
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,640
It seems so.

485
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,810
Who's the lassie?

486
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:40,730
Um...

487
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,600
It's my daughter.

488
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:47,560
You lie. She's not.

489
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,930
What?

490
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,350
I said July was hot.

491
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,350
Where's her mother?

492
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,480
Dead.

493
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,600
Oh. Sorry.

494
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:06,310
Why don't you two
lunch with me tomorrow?

495
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,560
That clerical crowd will be gone soon.

496
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,220
Um...

497
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,680
We'll be gone too, thanks.

498
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,350
Good night.

499
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,560
Sorry. I'm very drunk. Good night.

500
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,560
That child of yours needs a lot of sleep.

501
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,430
"Sleep is a rose" the Persians say.

502
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,930
Smoke?

503
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,310
Not just now, thanks.

504
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,430
Good night.

505
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,260
Enjoy.

506
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:50,840
Get back in the boat with Charlie.
You don't have to do that.

507
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,180
Back in the boat.

508
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,090
I'm thirsty.

509
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,590
I'll bring you something.

510
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,710
You... You played that with Charlie?
At camp?

511
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,000
Don't tell me you never tried it
when you were a kid.

512
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,460
Never.

513
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,630
I guess I'm gonna have to
show you everything.

514
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,210
Gentlewomen of the jury,...

515
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,370
..l was not even her first lover.

516
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:00,660
What are you reading?

517
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,710
Nothing.

518
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,170
What's the matter?

519
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:10,870
Nothing.

520
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,870
Lo...

521
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,580
You know that friend of yours
- Charlie - at camp?

522
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,120
Was he the first one?

523
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,830
Can we please get off the subject?

524
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,620
I felt more and more uncomfortable.

525
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,540
It was something quite special,
that feeling.

526
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,460
An oppressive, hideous constraint,...

527
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:50,210
..as if l were sitting with the small ghost
of somebody I had just killed.

528
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,910
Jesus!

529
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,580
What?

530
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,000
Can we stop at a gas station?

531
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,580
We can go anywhere you like.

532
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,750
Well, I need a gas station.

533
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,700
I hurt inside.

534
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,870
Well, what do you expect?

535
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,660
I was a daisy - fresh girl,
and look what you've done to me.

536
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:19,620
I should call the police and tell them
that you raped me, you dirty old man.

537
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,490
- Just wash the windscreen, would you?
- Yes, sir.

538
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,830
Got some cookies.

539
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:26,080
I want to call Mother in hospital.
What's the number?

540
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,910
Get in. You can't call the hospital.

541
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,870
Why not?

542
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,830
Just get in the car.

543
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,120
Slam the door.

544
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,700
Why can't I call my own mother
if I want to?

545
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,450
Because your mother's dead.

546
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,200
Shh... Shh...

547
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,950
We made up very gently that night.

548
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:06,160
You see, she had nowhere else to go.

549
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,400
It was then that we began
our extensive travels...

550
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,570
..all over the United States.

551
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:23,240

and civilisation is fine

552
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:30,320

is the thing for me to see

553
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,240


554
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,400

no no no no no no

555
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,990
- When's the best time to buy a bird?
- I don't know. When's the best time?

556
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,110
When it's going "cheep!"

557
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,530
Don't say I never gave you anything.

558
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,240
Ow! Don't! I'm trying to drive!

559
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,690
Don't do that! Oh, no!

560
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,440
If it goes out the window, I won't stop.

561
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:06,530
Don't! What are these? Hair grips?

562
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,440


563
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,030


564
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:22,190


565
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,650
Look! They have Magic Fingers.

566
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:35,820
Good.

567
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,980
I need to shower.

568
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,400
Give me a quarter and a dime.

569
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,070
What for?

570
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,480
For the Magic Fingers.

571
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,780
My magic fingers aren't enough?

572
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:22,820


573
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:27,980


574
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:31,900


575
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:38,770


576
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,310
Good shower for once, Lo!

577
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,860
First-rate temperature control!

578
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,520
Ow! Argh!

579
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,810
"Agh!" Lo!
- Hmm?

580
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:13,190
My God, Lo! Don't flush when I'm in here!

581
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,940
What is that?

582
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,100
What's what?

583
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:49,730
That thing in your mouth.

584
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,900
It's a jawbreaker.

585
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:56,480
It's supposed to break your jaw.
Want one?

586
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:00,100
Just give it to me.
I've had it with that noise.

587
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,980
- Come on, spit it out. I've got a headache.
- It's good!

588
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,730
Look, just give it to me, will you?
Spit it out.

589
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,980
You look a hundred per cent better
when I can't see you.

590
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,940
We took a circuitous route -
to put it mildly.

591
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:52,390
In the back of my mind
was our eventual destination.

592
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:58,100
Beardsley College, where I would finally
take up my teaching position.

593
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:03,230
But in the front of my mind was
the need to keep going, keep driving.

594
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,520
Lo, that's the last time
I let you drive this car.

595
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,930
Serve into this square.

596
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:13,270
And, despite our tiffs,...

597
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,810
In the square, Lo.
Try and get it in the square.

598
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,430
..despite the fuss she made, and
the danger and hopelessness of it all,...

599
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,060
Aim for my head.

600
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,140
..despite all that, I was in paradise.

601
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:34,100
A paradise whose skies
were the colour of hell flames,...

602
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,390
..but a paradise still.

603
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:33,170
I know you have accepted a post
at Beardsley College,...

604
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:37,840
..and I know that there,
academics are first, last and always.

605
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:41,420
Well, that's not us, Mr Himmler.

606
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:44,340
Uh... Here at Beardsley Prep,...

607
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:46,590
..what we stress are the three Ds.

608
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:50,050
Dramatics, dancing and dating.

609
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:55,090
Now, I know that the Reverend Rigger is
behind us on this. Aren't you, Reverend?

610
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:59,010
- All the way, Miss Pratt. Every inch.
- So you see, Mr Humper,...

611
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:04,250
..for the modern preadolescent, medieval
dates are less vital than weekend ones.

612
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:09,170
- What? Weekend what?
- Dates, Mr Humping.

613
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:12,000
Uh... boys.

614
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:23,710


615
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,460


616
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:29,590
I was not quite prepared
for the reality of my dual role.

617
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:33,340
On the one hand,
the willing corrupter of an innocent,...

618
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,460
..and on the other,
Humbert the happy housewife.

619
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,670
Where's the river Rhine?

620
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,540
I don't know.

621
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:46,710
You should know that.

622
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,840
- Why?
- Big battles there in the Great War.

623
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Where's the river Seine?

624
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,670
I don't know.

625
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:02,290
I thought you were supposed
to have learnt these.

626
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,460
It's not what I'm on.

627
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:08,590
It seems to be pretty relaxed,
this school of yours.

628
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,210


629
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,790

"Daughter, come here to me"

630
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,920

and things may go"

631
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,580

you ought to know"

632
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,880

it's the way that you do it"

633
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,580

it's the way that you do it"

634
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,580

it's the way that you do it"

635
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:32,710


636
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,330
I'm supposed to be in a play.

637
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,000
- What play?
- I don't know.

638
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:07,210
Some play.

639
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
At school.

640
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,670
With the boys from Butler's Academy?

641
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,540
I don't know.

642
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:24,710
Maybe.

643
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:28,420
I don't think it's a good idea.

644
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,420
You're depriving me of my civil rights.

645
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,160
Where did you learn that language?

646
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,540
I'm intelligent.

647
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,160
I have a right to be in a play if I want.

648
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:21,830
Not if I say you don't.

649
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:39,370
D'you like that?

650
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,700
You want more, don't you?

651
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,950
I want things, too.

652
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:10,910
What?

653
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,410
Things.

654
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,910
You know how my allowance
is a dollar a week?

655
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,580
Yes, I know.

656
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:25,160
Well, I think it should be two dollars.

657
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:36,990
I said, I think it should be two dollars.

658
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:43,240
A dollar fifty.

659
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,870
I really do think it should be two dollars.

660
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:00,870
Am I right?

661
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,120
Am I right?

662
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:08,370
God, yes.

663
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:10,320
Two dollars.

664
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:13,780
And I get to be in the play.

665
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,360
Oh, rosy mistress of the night.

666
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:24,030
You have enchanted
many a hunter's heart.

667
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,280
But this time, my temptress,...

668
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:29,320
..you have met your match.

669
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:32,370
For far more than a hunter,...

670
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:33,910
..l...

671
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,490
..am a poet.

672
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:41,280
- The night has fallen, Rodrigo.
- The...

673
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:42,950
Hold it! Hold it! Mona...

674
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:45,990
Give us a moment.
I'd like a word with Dolores.

675
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:52,110
When you say "your larking charms",
use your charms for the hunter.

676
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,200
Because you're the witch.

677
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,860
You're bringing the hunter to your lair.

678
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:00,660
- Hi, Mr Humbert.
- Hello, Mona.

679
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:03,610
Some play, huh?

680
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:06,610
You're nymphs.
Use your nymph's charms.

681
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,200
Seduce the hunter.

682
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,360
Look. See right there?

683
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:15,700
That's the actual playwright, Clare Quilty.
Can you believe it?

684
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,320
Let the music transform you.

685
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:21,030
You'll feel that you've become a witch.

686
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,910
- You're a witch!

687
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:28,320
- This play any good, Mona?
- Yeah. It's very political.

688
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:30,490
Witch! Witch!

689
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:32,610
More wind! More wind!

690
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,450
You're a witch!

691
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:36,610
Aren't you?

692
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,780
More wind! I need more wind!

693
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:42,200
The witches now! The witches' dance!

694
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,740
In the wind!

695
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:51,530
As she grew cooler
towards my advances,...

696
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:55,030
..l became accustomed
to purchasing her favours.

697
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:58,820
Where she hid the money, I never knew.

698
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:00,740
Stop it!

699
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:05,440
I was convinced she was storing it away
in order to finance her escape from me.

700
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:11,990
You can't expect me to pay extra
in the middle!

701
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:13,900
Ow! Argh!

702
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:16,780
She's a lovely child, Mr Haze,...

703
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:21,280
..but the onset of sexual maturing
seems to be giving her trouble.

704
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,650
- Isn't that your observation, Reverend?
- To the tee, Miss Pratt.

705
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:30,280
So, you see, it is the general impression
that 14-year-old Dolores...

706
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,650
..is morbidly disinterested
in sexual matters.

707
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:38,070
Does she never speak
about these... matters?

708
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:39,900
Well...

709
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:42,030
That's just it.

710
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:51,980
What's just it?

711
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,150
That's... just it.

712
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,530
She hasn't said anything.

713
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:58,980
She hasn't breathed a word.

714
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:03,820
Uh... But who has?

715
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:10,320
Are... Are you saying that I've...

716
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,480
Exactly.

717
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:15,110
This is a very serious matter.

718
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,360
What we're trying to say to you...

719
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,940
..is that someone in the family,...

720
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:22,320
..maybe you,...

721
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,070
This is very difficult for me.

722
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:27,280
Well, let me put it this way.

723
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,440
Someone in the family
ought to instruct that dear child...

724
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:34,020
..in the process of human reproduction.

725
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:35,860
I'm so sorry.

726
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:38,820
- I'm so sorry.
- I see that I've embarrassed you.

727
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:42,480
Yet you, as her father,
ought to take the matter well in hand.

728
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,690
Yes. Worry not, Miss Pratt.

729
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,360
I... um... I have... this matter in hand.

730
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,270
Oh, well,...

731
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,980
..that's all I need to say.

732
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:07,190
Yes?

733
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,070
Oh, yes?

734
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,980
She missed?

735
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,480
Oh.

736
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,440
Bye.

737
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,650
How are the piano lessons going?

738
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:31,810
Fine.

739
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,900
Great. Excellent. Wonderful.

740
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,060
Terrif. Perfect.

741
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,690
Especially since you missed the last two.

742
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,520
Where were you?

743
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,980
Where was l?

744
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:56,400
I should have told you before.

745
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:02,230
I was in the park.
I was rehearsing the play with Mona.

746
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:04,400
That's your story?

747
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,560
That's what I was doing.

748
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,480
OK. Give me Mona's phone number.

749
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,810
- Mona's phone number?
- Just give me Mona's phone number.

750
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,690
Klausen 57241.

751
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,480
Is Mona there, please?

752
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,730
- Mona, this is Dolores's father.
- Oh, hello, sir.

753
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:39,890
Mona, were you and Dolores...

754
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:44,100
..rehearsing the play in the park
for the past two Tuesday afternoons?

755
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:45,850
Um... Let's see.

756
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,560
The last two Tuesdays?

757
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:51,190
One of them, Mona, was yesterday.

758
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:54,140
You know, sir, that's... absolutely right.

759
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:56,310
I feel awfully bad about it.

760
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,350
I alone am to blame, sir.

761
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,810
The whole rehearsing in the park thing
was my idea.

762
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:05,020
We did it cos we didn't want
to get on your nerves.

763
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,560
Well?

764
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:16,020
Did she confirm?

765
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,180
She did.

766
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:21,680
And I've no doubt
she'd been well instructed by you.

767
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,230
In fact, I've no doubt
you've told her all about us.

768
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,970
Look, Lo, this has got to stop.

769
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,720
I don't know what you're up to,
but whatever it is,...

770
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:45,720
..I'll yank you out of Beardsley as fast as
I can pack a suitcase unless this stops!

771
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:47,270
Unless what stops?

772
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,930
- You know what!
- Take it easy, mister!

773
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:53,520
- Show me every penny...
- Leave me alone, you pervert!

774
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:57,970
- You're running away from me, I know.
- Yes, I am! Anyone'd run away from you!

775
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,600
- Show me what you hid!
- I earned that money!

776
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:10,260
Go ahead, murder me.
Like you murdered my mother.

777
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:11,310
I'm sorry.

778
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:13,850
Murder me like you murdered my mother!

779
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,010
Shut up. Shut up!

780
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,720
Murder me like you murdered my mother!

781
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:20,060
- Stop that!
- Go ahead! Murder me!

782
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:23,100
Go on, murder me!
I'm asking you to murder me!

783
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:25,260
- Shut up!
- Murder me! Murder me!

784
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:29,060
- Dolores, shut up!
- I hate you! I hate you!

785
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,220
Calm down.

786
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:33,060
- Calm down!

787
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:36,100
- Come back, Lo!

788
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:38,930
Murderer!

789
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,430
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

790
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,600
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

791
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:56,010
I do not know who you people think
you are, screaming and carrying on!

792
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:59,510
My daughter's friend.
I'm sorry. I really can't stay.

793
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,680
Oh, good. I was just trying
to reach you at home.

794
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,720
- I've come to a decision.
- You have?

795
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,680
Yeah.

796
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,840
So buy me a drink.

797
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:37,010
What would you like?

798
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:39,340
Um... I'd like, uh, ice-cream soda...

799
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:41,510
..with extra chocolate syrup.

800
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,680
Please.

801
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:48,050
Nothing for me, thanks.

802
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:03,050
Lo...

803
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:25,840
So tell me.

804
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:34,340
What's the rush?

805
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:53,630
Pay her and let's blow this joint.

806
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And do you know what she said,...

807
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:15,340
..this girl who had been spurning me,
mocking me,...

808
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,590
..plotting her escape from me
only hours before?

809
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:22,090
She said she wanted
to leave Beardsley then and there.

810
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,460
She wanted to take another trip,...

811
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:27,750
..only this time she would choose
where we would go.

812
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,590
- OK? I choose? OK?
- Yes.

813
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,670
Did Humbert hum his assent?

814
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,840
Oh, yes.

815
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I sealed my fate gratefully.

816
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:21,290
Lolita.

817
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:26,920
Take me to bed.

818
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,460
Look out for cigarette hangover.

819
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:53,290
Hi. I'm Clare Quilty.

820
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:55,790
Remember, over a million smokers...

821
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,960
So we have to be in...

822
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
..Wace in exactly one week.

823
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:03,250
But why Wace in a week?

824
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:08,540
Cos we gotta see the... ceremonial dances
when they open the Magic Caves.

825
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:12,080
And... exactly two weeks
and four days later,...

826
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:14,790
..we have to arrive in Elphinstone. See?

827
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:18,370
Yes.

828
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,710
That's where we climb the Red Rock.

829
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:24,710
We have to climb this rock
exactly two weeks and four days later?

830
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:26,870
Exactly.

831
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,040
Oh, I'm so excited.

832
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:57,160
I cannot tell you the exact day I first knew
for certain that we were being followed.

833
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,580
Lo, reach into the glove compartment
and get the pad and pencil.

834
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:29,750
Got it? Now write this down.

835
01:29:30,910 --> 01:29:32,700
Connecticut.

836
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,250
How do you spell that?

837
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:35,870
C- O-N-N.

838
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,540
Is that it?

839
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,290
No. Now write down...

840
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:40,950
..PJ...

841
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,080
..44...

842
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:45,120
..396.

843
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:48,330
All right, give it to me.

844
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,620
All right.

845
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:59,200
Put it in the glove box.
Don't put gum on it cos it'll get...

846
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:01,700
Why have you got your gum everywhere?

847
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:03,490
Put that in the glove box.

848
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:06,580
There's a detective following us.

849
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,490
He looks rather like my Uncle Gustave.

850
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,120
He was clever, our pursuer.

851
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,290
He kept changing cars.

852
01:30:27,450 --> 01:30:29,660
But his presence was as real to me...

853
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:31,830
..as my own breath.

854
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:42,370
Then suddenly he would disappear
and I'd wonder if I'd imagined everything.

855
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:01,870
Lo! What did that man say to you?

856
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:05,070

which is red instead of white

857
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,320
- What did he say to you?
- The guy I was talking to?

858
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:11,160
- Yeah. Look...
-

859
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,280
Just tell me what he said to you.

860
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:16,320
He asked me if I had a map.
He must've been lost.

861
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:18,490


862
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:20,910


863
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:25,240


864
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:30,070
Look, I've told you about
talking to strangers. You've no idea...

865
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:32,240
Lo, listen to me.

866
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:36,070
You're very young
and people can take advantage of you.

867
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,240
Very hard to imagine.

868
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,200
That man was the cop
who's been following us.

869
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,150
You have to tell me
exactly what you told him.

870
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:48,740
If he really is a cop, the worst thing
we can do is let him know we're scared.

871
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:51,070
Then he'll know that we're guilty.

872
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,240
Or rather, that you're guilty.

873
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:07,360

with anyone else but me...

874
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,650


875
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:20,610


876
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:50,030


877
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:52,110


878
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:55,280


879
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:03,030
There's something wrong
with the steering.

880
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:05,280
Oh, whoa!

881
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,780
Ow! Watch it!

882
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,730
What are you doing?!

883
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,230
You got a flat, mister.

884
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:50,820


885
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:59,060


886
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,020
Hey...

887
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:15,770
Hey!

888
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:17,730
Hey, you! Come back here!

889
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,270
The!

890
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,810
The! The!

891
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:23,940
The!

892
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:25,520
Put on the handbrake!

893
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:28,230
Pull the handbrake up! Lo!

894
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,610
Lo! Pull on the handbrake. Stop the car.

895
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:36,690
Put the handbrake on. Down there! Pull it!

896
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:38,350
- Ow!

897
01:35:39,730 --> 01:35:40,810
Jesus Christ!

898
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:43,690
What did you think you were doing?

899
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:45,860
You should thank me.

900
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:48,270
The car was rolling and I stopped it.

901
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:53,770
You should thank me.

902
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,480
Pass me the pad
in the glove compartment.

903
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:05,770
It was smart of us
to write his number down.

904
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:10,600
What...?

905
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:12,440
What have you...

906
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,150
The...

907
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,480
The...

908
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:49,730
Lo, I'm sorry.

909
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:52,560
- I'm sorry!

910
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:02,940
Come here. Come here.

911
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:05,060
Get away!

912
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,770
The...

913
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:10,930
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

914
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,560
I'm sorry.

915
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:40,560
Shall I walk down to the town
and get you some fruit?

916
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,680
Bananas.

917
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,560
Just bananas?

918
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:58,810
Just bananas.

919
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:13,470


920
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:17,140


921
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:19,970


922
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:24,810
-
-

923
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:38,060


924
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:42,850
Quilty can't be here in our studio
because he's in Wace, Texas tonight...

925
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:46,010
..working on the premiere
of his brand-new play.

926
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:49,010
But I want to welcome
his writing partner,...

927
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:52,300
..the lovely and talented
Miss Vivian Darkbloom.

928
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:54,680
Let's give her a warm Texas welcome.

929
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:27,260
You've been out.

930
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:30,390
I just got up.

931
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:37,510
Don't lie to me.

932
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,680
Well, I did go out for a second.

933
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:48,680
You were gone so long.
I wanted to see if you were coming back.

934
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:41,420
You tell me who it is! Who is it?

935
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:44,090
Who is it? Tell me who it is.

936
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:48,510
You tell me. Who is it?

937
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:50,430
Who...?

938
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:53,380
- Tell me.

939
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:54,630
Please, tell me.

940
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,470
Please tell me.

941
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:10,630
Please tell me.

942
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,170
Please tell me.

943
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:27,880
Please!

944
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:29,880
Please... tell... me!

945
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:32,050
Please... please...

946
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:35,090
Please...

947
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:37,260
..tell me!

948
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:38,630
Please...

949
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,010
..please...

950
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:41,510
..please...

951
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,500
I'll show you to room number 29.

952
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:32,670
It's one of our nicer rooms.

953
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:36,210
Say, what's wrong
with your little daughter? ls she ill?

954
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:38,790
Oh, no. She's just feeling a bit... um...

955
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:44,330
My God, Lo!

956
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,080
Are you all right?

957
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,750
I don't feel... I don't feel very well.

958
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:52,580
It's a virus.

959
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:55,830
Nothing serious.
I've had 40 cases in two weeks.

960
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,670
- So can I take her home?
- We're gonna keep her here overnight.

961
01:43:59,830 --> 01:44:02,000
Keep her hydrated, help her sleep.

962
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:16,750
Why don't you get some sleep?
It won't help if you catch it.

963
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,380
I think I have already.
I feel dreadful.

964
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:21,540
- Maybe I should stay.
- Go.

965
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:23,620
Call us in the morning.

966
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:26,000
- Here, I'll take those.
- Thank you.

967
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:58,080
Uh, yes, hello. This is Mr Humbert.

968
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:02,160
I'm calling to see how my... daughter,
Dolores Haze, is.

969
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:04,330
Oh, she's much better.

970
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,790
She was up early. No trace of fever.

971
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,210
And when Uncle Gustave came for her,
we signed her out.

972
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,620
Who? Wh... Wh... Who?

973
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:17,000
Uncle Gustave, Dolores called him.

974
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:20,790
He had a sweet little dog.
He was the nicest man. Had a big smile.

975
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,330
Wait, Ted.

976
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:26,540
- And you let her go with him?
- Oh, yes. He paid the bill in cash.

977
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:31,540
They said to tell you not to worry,
and they'll be at Grandpa's expecting you.

978
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:35,370
- Then they went off in that nice Cadillac.

979
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:37,540
Hello?

980
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:57,160
Hey!

981
01:45:57,330 --> 01:45:59,000
Hey!

982
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:09,830
Nurse!

983
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:11,990
- Where is she?
- Who?

984
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:14,620
Who took her?
Somebody took my daughter.

985
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:17,740
- You need to talk to the doctor.
- But who took her?

986
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:20,080
My daughter was in there last night.

987
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:22,540
- Who took her away?
- Hey, relax, pal!

988
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:26,160
Don't tell me to relax!
I'm looking for my daughter! Doctor!

989
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:28,040
Doctor! Doctor!

990
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,200
What have you done with her?

991
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:32,450
Where is she? Where is she?

992
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:35,370
Tell me where she is! Where is she?

993
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:38,120
Where has she gone?
Where? Where? Where?

994
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:42,660
You leave me alone, you bastards!

995
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:44,540
You fucking fiends!

996
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:46,700
Tell me where she is!

997
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:50,950
Get me to that man!

998
01:46:52,830 --> 01:46:55,370
I'm just looking for my daughter!

999
01:46:56,530 --> 01:47:00,080
- I said relax!
- I want to know where she -

1000
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:04,740
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1001
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:06,370
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1002
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:08,240
Sorry.

1003
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:10,570
I'm sorry. I'm just a little bit...

1004
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:14,620
I think I may just have...
had a little too much to drink. Sorry.

1005
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:18,080
I'm very worried
about my daughter, you see.

1006
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:20,700
But she's with her Uncle Gustave.

1007
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:22,870
So she'll be all right.

1008
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:25,200
I'm very sorry. Please forgive me.

1009
01:47:25,370 --> 01:47:27,700
She's gone to her... grandpa's farm.

1010
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:30,910
She'll be absolutely fine there.

1011
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:33,070
What better place for her?

1012
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,570
I'm... I'm fine.

1013
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:37,740
Please, I'm sorry.

1014
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:39,910
So sorry. Thank you very much.

1015
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:42,070
Sorry... Sorry.

1016
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,240
So sorry.

1017
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,280
I searched all our old haunts...

1018
01:48:01,450 --> 01:48:05,030
..and for several months
the trail remained warm.

1019
01:48:07,610 --> 01:48:11,990
The thief, the kidnapper,
whatever you want to call him,...

1020
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,820
..he was clever.

1021
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:15,990
He would disguise his name.

1022
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:18,700
But I could always tell his handwriting.

1023
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:21,990
Um... Sir!

1024
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,320
He had very peculiar Ts, Ws and Ls.

1025
01:48:28,490 --> 01:48:30,990
Do you know his name?

1026
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:34,570
What does he look like?

1027
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:39,030
- Let me help.
- No, please...

1028
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:43,610
Ladies, I'm sorry. We're trying to find...

1029
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:47,030
It must be hard
for you who already know who it was...

1030
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:49,450
..to understand my mystification.

1031
01:48:58,030 --> 01:49:00,690
Or maybe you think
I was imagining things.

1032
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:02,450
..my daughter.

1033
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:08,440
Maybe you think it impossible that
there could have been another like me.

1034
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:13,400
Another mad lover of nymphets following
us over the great and ugly plains.

1035
01:49:13,570 --> 01:49:15,780
Well, you are right, of course.

1036
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:17,950
There was no-one else like me.

1037
01:49:27,190 --> 01:49:29,740
Eventually the trail went cold and dead.

1038
01:49:34,030 --> 01:49:36,690
And I went back to cold, dead Beardsley.

1039
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:34,190
"Dear Dad, how's everything?"

1040
01:50:35,190 --> 01:50:37,610
"I'm married. I'm going to have a baby."

1041
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:42,650
"I guess it'll come
right around Christmas."

1042
01:50:44,610 --> 01:50:46,730
"This is a hard letter to write."

1043
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:49,860
"I'm going nuts
because we don't have enough...

1044
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:52,360
..to pay our debts and get out of here."

1045
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:56,650
"Dick has been promised
a big job in Alaska."

1046
01:50:59,230 --> 01:51:01,230
"Are you still mad at me?"

1047
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:07,360
"Please send us a cheque, Dad. We could
manage with three or four hundred,...

1048
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,900
..or even less. Anything is welcome."

1049
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:13,860
"I have gone through
much sadness and hardship."

1050
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:16,020
"Yours expecting, Dolly."

1051
01:51:17,690 --> 01:51:19,690
"Mrs Richard F...

1052
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:23,810
..Schiller."

1053
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:45,520
Well!

1054
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:18,350
Come in.

1055
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:33,310
You, Molly, stay out.

1056
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,310
Good girl.

1057
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:37,890
Husband at home?

1058
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:39,850
Yeah.

1059
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:42,980
Where do you wanna sit?
The rocker or the divan?

1060
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:46,060
Come sit with me on the divan.

1061
01:53:52,930 --> 01:53:54,520
Is that him?

1062
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:57,930
Up the ladder?

1063
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:00,770
You want me to call him in?

1064
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:03,430
No.

1065
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:06,270
He's not the one I want.

1066
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:10,310
He's not the what?

1067
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:12,600
You know what I mean.

1068
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:14,970
Where is he?

1069
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:17,140
Look...

1070
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:22,260
Dick has nothing to do with all that stuff.
He thinks you're my father.

1071
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:24,680
Please don't bring up all that muck.

1072
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:29,770
- All right, I'll find out myself.
- You really don't know?

1073
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:39,020
My God, Dad, it was Quilty.

1074
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:41,310
It was Clare Quilty.

1075
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:51,430
Yes.

1076
01:54:56,930 --> 01:54:59,050
Yes, of course.

1077
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:19,890
Quilty.

1078
01:55:21,010 --> 01:55:23,010
Yeah.

1079
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:28,890
He was the only man
I was ever really crazy about.

1080
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:35,890
What about me?

1081
01:56:03,430 --> 01:56:05,430
Where did he take you?

1082
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:11,720
Just tell me.

1083
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:15,760
Well, everybody knew he liked little girls.

1084
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:20,800
He used to film them in his mansion
over in Parkington, Pavor Manor.

1085
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:26,430
But I wasn't gonna do all those things.

1086
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:29,930
All what things?

1087
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:32,180
Two girls and two boys or...

1088
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:34,430
..l don't know, three or four men.

1089
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:37,050
And Vivian was filming the whole thing.

1090
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:41,050
I said "No, I'm not gonna blow
all those beastly boys."

1091
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:43,340
"I want you."

1092
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:48,550
So he threw me out.

1093
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:00,300
I looked and looked at her...

1094
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:05,630
..and I knew,
as clearly as I know that I will die,...

1095
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:10,380
..that I loved her more than anything
I'd ever seen or imagined on earth.

1096
01:57:14,510 --> 01:57:18,470
She was only the dead leaf echo
of the nymphet from long ago...

1097
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:22,090
..but I loved her, this Lolita,...

1098
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:25,720
..pale and polluted
and big with another man's child.

1099
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:29,050
She could fade and wither - I didn't care.

1100
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:33,720
I would still go mad with tenderness...

1101
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,840
..at the mere sight of her face.

1102
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:01,340
Lolita...

1103
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:07,710
From here to that old car
that you know so well...

1104
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:10,130
..is a stretch of 25 paces.

1105
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,420
Make those 25 steps...

1106
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:17,590
..with me, now.

1107
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:22,170
You're saying you'll give us some money
if I go to a motel with you?

1108
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:24,300
No... No!

1109
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:28,960
I'm saying leave here and come live
with me, die with me, everything with me.

1110
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:32,130
You're crazy.

1111
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:35,000
If you refuse, you still get the money.

1112
01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:36,590
- Really?
- Yeah.

1113
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:40,380
There. Have it.

1114
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:51,250
Oh my God.

1115
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:54,710
You're giving us four thousand bucks?

1116
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:59,590
- Thank you...
- No...

1117
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:01,750
Don't touch me.

1118
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:03,920
I'll die if you touch me.

1119
01:59:05,250 --> 01:59:09,960
Just tell me...
there's a chance you'll come with me.

1120
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:13,750
No, honey.

1121
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,250
I'd almost rather go back with Clare.

1122
01:59:19,710 --> 01:59:21,710
Oh...

1123
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:23,880
I'll go now.

1124
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:30,330
- Can I call Dick in to say goodbye?
- No. I don't want to see him, at all.

1125
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:33,540
I just want to go.

1126
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,210
Lo, can you ever forget
what I've done to you?

1127
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:53,380
Say goodbye, Molly.

1128
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:56,460
Say goodbye to my dad.

1129
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:05,750
Dick! Guess what!

1130
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:29,000
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,...

1131
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:34,080
..l have to say that I regret all I did
before that last goodbye in Coalmont.

1132
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:39,710
But I regret nothing of what came after.

1133
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:17,580
Now, who are you?

1134
02:03:21,370 --> 02:03:23,450
Are you, by any chance, Brewster?

1135
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,620
You know, you don't look
like Jack Brewster.

1136
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:36,280
I mean, the resemblance
is not particularly striking.

1137
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:40,950
Somebody told me he had a brother
with the same phone company.

1138
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:43,120
I'm neither of the Brewsters.

1139
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,660
Pull over!

1140
02:03:52,740 --> 02:03:54,240
Pull over!

1141
02:03:57,450 --> 02:03:59,870
Do you recall a little girl named...

1142
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:03,490
..Dolores Haze?

1143
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:10,110
You see, I'm her father.

1144
02:04:11,490 --> 02:04:12,990
Nonsense.

1145
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:16,610
You're a foreigner.
You're an agent of a foreign power.

1146
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:18,870
You're a foreign literary agent.

1147
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:21,450
She was my daughter.

1148
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:23,610
She was my child.

1149
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:26,160
Oh, you know, I adore children myself.

1150
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:28,320
And fathers...

1151
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:30,530
I love fathers.

1152
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:35,860
Ah...

1153
02:04:36,030 --> 02:04:36,990
Sit down!

1154
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:40,700
Oh. There they are.

1155
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:43,110
Now we need matches. You got a light?

1156
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,860
Quilty, I want you to concentrate.

1157
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:50,910
You're about to die.

1158
02:04:51,070 --> 02:04:53,400
Ooh.

1159
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:02,950
Jesus!

1160
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:08,610
Do you want to be executed
standing up or sitting down?

1161
02:05:08,780 --> 02:05:12,200
Just let me think, let me think.
It's not an easy question.

1162
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:14,820
Try to understand what is happening.

1163
02:05:14,990 --> 02:05:15,820
I- l-l-l...

1164
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:19,360
- Remember Dolores Haze.
- I'm willing...

1165
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:22,860
I'm willing to try. I am. Just...

1166
02:05:23,030 --> 02:05:24,700
OK. Listen.

1167
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:26,860
I made a mistake, which I regret,...

1168
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:28,950
..sincerely.

1169
02:05:29,110 --> 02:05:34,610
I couldn't have any fun with your Dolly.
I'm practically impotent is the sad truth.

1170
02:05:34,780 --> 02:05:39,490
But she had a swell vacation, met some
remarkable people. Hey, do you know -

1171
02:05:54,190 --> 02:05:55,650
Stay still!

1172
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:59,320
Oh, God...

1173
02:06:00,150 --> 02:06:02,150
You cheated me.

1174
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:06,780
You cheated me of my redemption.

1175
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:12,940
- You have to die.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1176
02:06:13,110 --> 02:06:16,940
My memory and my eloquence
are not at their best today.

1177
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:21,440
But really, you have to admit
you were never an ideal stepfather.

1178
02:06:21,610 --> 02:06:23,610
Hm?

1179
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:26,230
I did not force your protégée to join me.

1180
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:29,400
It was she who made me
remove her to a happier home.

1181
02:06:29,570 --> 02:06:31,860
Look around you. See?

1182
02:06:32,030 --> 02:06:34,030
You see this house?

1183
02:06:34,190 --> 02:06:38,780
It's very cool in the summer. Comfortable.
I suggest that you move in, hm?

1184
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:43,820
I think you'll be happy here.

1185
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:46,900
You can use my wardrobe.

1186
02:06:47,860 --> 02:06:51,020
We have the most reliable
and bribable charwoman.

1187
02:06:51,190 --> 02:06:53,650
"Cleaning lady" is the American term.

1188
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:57,400
She has not only daughters,
she has granddaughters.

1189
02:06:57,570 --> 02:07:00,860
And I know a thing or two
about the chief of police...

1190
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:03,070
..that makes him my slave.

1191
02:07:03,230 --> 02:07:05,320
My slave. Drop the gun.

1192
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:07,980
And here's another thing. Drop the gun.

1193
02:07:08,150 --> 02:07:12,020
I have, upstairs,
the most unique collection of erotica.

1194
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:13,560
Drop the gun. Drop the gun.

1195
02:07:13,730 --> 02:07:17,860
Also, moreover, I can arrange
for you to attend executions.

1196
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:21,020
Not everybody knows
the chair is painted yellow.

1197
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:24,900
Somebody help!

1198
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,150
Aargh! Agh!

1199
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:35,150
That hurts, sir.

1200
02:08:35,310 --> 02:08:37,890
That hurts atrociously, my dear fellow.

1201
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:50,560
God...

1202
02:08:50,730 --> 02:08:53,810
You should not continue
in this fashion, really.

1203
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,270
Get out!

1204
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:28,100
Get out of here!

1205
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:40,720
What I heard then was
the melody of children at play.

1206
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:42,890
Nothing but that.

1207
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:48,430
And I knew that
the hopelessly poignant thing...

1208
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:51,430
..was not Lolita's absence from my side...

1209
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:56,140
..but the absence of her voice
from that chorus.

1209
02:11:57,305 --> 02:12:03,781
