1
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:11,566
I got out of the institution
on the day of my sister's wedding.

2
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,569
I had started to get used to the place.

3
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,071
Breakfast at 8:00, classes at 2:00,

4
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,533
therapy at 4:00 and asleep by 10:00.

5
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,160
You can call me any time, Lee.

6
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,205
I will always try to be of help to you.

7
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,541
Inside, life was simple.

8
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,002
Thank you, Dr. Twardon.

9
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,046
For that reason, I was reluctant to go.

10
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,923
Bon voyage.

11
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,639
Hi, Peter.

12
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:28,726
Peter, yeah,
who you almost successfully forgot.

13
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,645
- No, I did not.
- Come on, everybody!

14
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,897
Are you happy to be home?

15
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,360
I mean, are you happy to be home?

16
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,655
I don't know.

17
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,116
I know what you mean.

18
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,009
Here's a little something
for the lovebirds.

19
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:04,637
Boy!

20
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,140
You look so beautiful.

21
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,685
Thanks, Dad.

22
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,022
I thought you stopped.

23
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,362
Do you know how much
we missed you, pumpkin?

24
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,823
Well, I missed you, too.

25
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,831
You know what?

26
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,041
I don't feel too good.

27
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,377
Let's go sit down.

28
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,252
- Bye!
- Goodbye!

29
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,342
- Have fun!
- Goodbye! Take care!

30
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,321
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

31
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,324
<i>You want to treat me like I'm a child.
You want to talk to me like a child.</i>

32
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,408
<i>- Huh? You think I'm a child?
- You...</i>

33
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,827
<i>You think I don't know
what I'm doing?</i>

34
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,245
<i>You act like a child!</i>

35
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,329
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

36
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,165
<i>You don't act like a man.
You've been fired!</i>

37
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,585
<i>Well, I'm glad I'm fired!</i>

38
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,088
I'm glad I'm fired!
Boy, I hated that job!

39
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,757
I don't care that you hated it!
You're drunk!

40
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,593
I'm not drunk! Why do you...
Why do you... I'm not drunk!

41
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,680
- Why do you always say that?
- Get off my back!

42
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,197
Watch this. You watch this.

43
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,181
Avoid the temptation
of placing your fingers

44
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,266
on the home keys by sight.

45
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:24,230
Strike each key so that your fingers
bounce with each stroke.

46
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,607
Do not strike without thinking.

47
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:30,861
Do not even attempt
to steal a glance at your paper.

48
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,198
"My flowers had just
about given up in despair,

49
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,451
"so with the exception
of a few potted plants from the florist,

50
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,621
"we're flowerless
for the first spring in years."

51
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,289
And time!

52
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,419
I'm so proud of you, honey.

53
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,297
Getting out in the world like this.

54
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,052
When my accident happened,

55
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,765
we were in the kitchen
and my back was to her.

56
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,727
Upstairs, my dad was just leaving for work

57
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,980
at Havis department store.

58
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,317
Because there was a limited amount of time
that my mom's back was turned...

59
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,404
- Lee!
- I slipped and cut too deep.

60
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,324
I'm not sure how I could have misjudged.

61
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,160
I've been doing it since seventh grade.

62
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,346
Just a precaution.

63
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,354
"Be a leader."

64
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,366
I have never had a job before,

65
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:46,497
but I can assure you that I am very excited
about this opportunity.

66
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,957
Thank you.

67
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:54,338
Well, I don't have any references yet.

68
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,050
But I think that the municipal tax office

69
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:02,888
would be a wonderful place to begin

70
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,266
my career.

71
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,362
"Secretary."

72
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,647
Hello. I...

73
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,318
Wait! I...

74
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,222
Hello?

75
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,473
In here.

76
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:24,196
Hi.

77
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,325
Are you the lawyer?

78
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,811
Oh. Uh...

79
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,314
Yes.

80
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,334
I'm sorry. I'll just come back later.

81
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,568
No.

82
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,588
No, stay.

83
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,276
It said "secretary."

84
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,697
That's right.

85
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,370
Are you pregnant?

86
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,399
No.

87
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,295
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

88
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,491
No.

89
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,887
- Are you living in an apartment?
- A house.

90
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,640
- Alone?
- With my parents.

91
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,434
Siblings?

92
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,229
Well, my sister is going to live
in the backyard

93
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,732
with her husband in the pool house.

94
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,009
Are you married?

95
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,553
No.

96
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,491
Have you ever won an award?

97
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,784
Yes.

98
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,745
What did you win the award in?

99
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:55,996
Typing.

100
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,837
Are those your scores?

101
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,825
Yes.

102
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,387
"Lee Holloway."

103
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,068
Could you get me
a cup of coffee with sugar?

104
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,048
Do you really want to be a secretary, Lee?

105
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,800
Yes, I do.

106
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,978
You scored higher
than anyone I've ever interviewed.

107
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,774
You're really over-qualified for the job.

108
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,653
- You'd be bored to death.
- I want to be bored.

109
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,497
I have a part-time paralegal.

110
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:08,378
All I need is a typist

111
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,467
who can get to work on time
and answer the phone.

112
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,260
I can do that.

113
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:19,306
We only use typewriters here,
not computers.

114
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,082
That's fine.

115
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,186
It's very dull work.

116
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,730
I like dull work.

117
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,114
There's something about you.

118
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,185
You're...

119
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,291
You're closed up tight.

120
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,795
A wall.

121
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,881
I know.

122
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,676
Do you ever loosen up?

123
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,140
I don't know.

124
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,604
I'm not here.

125
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,621
Less sugar in the coffee.

126
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,756
How'd it go?

127
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,052
I got it.

128
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,355
I knew you could do it!

129
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,813
Hello.

130
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,370
Hello.

131
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:28,643
You have reached the office
of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

132
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,607
Please leave your message
and the time you called,

133
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,735
along with your phone number

134
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,404
and the best time to reach you,

135
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:49,539
and we will get back to you
as soon as possible.

136
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,610
We.

137
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,422
Secretary.

138
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,313
Type up this letter and send four
copies to O'Malley and Barrett.

139
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,274
Right away, sir.

140
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,665
That's good. That's good.

141
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,380
So, you're the new secretary.

142
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,908
Yeah.

143
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,223
Excuse me.

144
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,600
What exactly is a paralegal?

145
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,276
See you.

146
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,367
Oh, um...

147
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,593
Okay.

148
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:31,516
Up at the sides. Wide-eyed.

149
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,209
I brought you these.

150
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,680
I think I accidentally threw out my notes
on the Feldman case.

151
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,098
Maybe you could...

152
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,267
Go through the garbage?

153
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,150
Yes, Lee. Thank you.

154
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,351
Why are you here?

155
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,938
I'm just waiting for you, honey.

156
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,357
But I'm here for five more hours.

157
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,693
I know.

158
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,040
Excuse me, sir.

159
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,378
It's okay. I found another set.

160
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,550
This needs more sugar.

161
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,052
- Sugar?
- And six copies of these.

162
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,640
Freshen up that trap, Lee.

163
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,517
And put out one more.

164
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:50,089
Mice like to go behind the chairs, too, Lee.

165
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,342
Just because it's hard to reach

166
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:55,261
does not mean that we don't
take care of every possibility.

167
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,436
Here. Give me that.

168
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,620
Thank you.

169
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,790
E. Edward Grey's office. May I help you?

170
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,003
We're very happy with ATandT.
Thanks, though.

171
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,421
Is he in?

172
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,672
Could you just wait one moment?

173
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,302
You're right.
That is a very good offer.

174
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,594
I'm going back now.

175
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,306
Could you just wait one minute, please?

176
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,892
Yes, I do understand that.

177
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,936
Submissive.

178
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:30,882
Excuse me?

179
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,133
Edward!

180
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:38,281
Listen, I have no idea if we make over $40

181
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,409
worth of long distance calls
to Chattanooga each month.

182
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,957
Tell him it's Tricia O'Connor.

183
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,085
Mr. Grey?

184
00:27:58,719 --> 00:27:59,886
Hello?

185
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,976
Mr. Grey?

186
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,187
Ms. Holloway.

187
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,365
Mr. Grey?

188
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,910
I'm not here.

189
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,499
Okay.

190
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,799
I'm afraid he's gone.

191
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,218
Is that right?

192
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,935
E. Edward Grey's office.

193
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,354
Is that you, honey? It's me.

194
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,588
Daddy?

195
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,732
It's so good to hear your voice.

196
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,109
Dad.

197
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,052
Where are you?

198
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,072
I'm downtown, somewhere.

199
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,450
Could you please hold?

200
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,038
Do you have a message, Ms. O'Connor?

201
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,677
Tell him to sign the settlement.

202
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,642
Hello?

203
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,061
Hello?

204
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,480
Hello, Dad?

205
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,228
How's work?

206
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:56,879
Fine.

207
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,649
How's Mr. Grey?

208
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,485
He's fine.

209
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,695
Well, Peter called.

210
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,667
Some people, right, have to wash
something as soon as they've worn it,

211
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,585
- you know, for, like, half a day.
- Yes.

212
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,629
And then you got your more
laid-back folk who just,

213
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,006
you know, maybe they'll
wash their stuff when it's dirty.

214
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,800
Which kind are you?

215
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,719
I'm the type of guy

216
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,807
who wants to get married and have a kid.

217
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,188
I wash my clothes just when they're dirty.

218
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:43,442
Me, too, and...
And that is what counts in a relationship.

219
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,778
Compatibility.

220
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,574
In a relationship?

221
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:50,955
- Ln a relationship.
- Relationship.

222
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,673
May I interest you in a little more?

223
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,843
- Just a little more?
- Why not? Okay.

224
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,060
You're different
than you were in high school, Peter.

225
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,521
I... I changed.

226
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,189
What happened?

227
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,734
I had a nervous breakdown.

228
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,069
Me, too.

229
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,698
Sort of.

230
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,081
Two items. This and these.

231
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,042
- Peter?
- Yes, Lee?

232
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:45,379
I've read that if you
wear that kind of underwear,

233
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,841
that it squeezes

234
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,844
your things.

235
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:53,929
- Balls.
- Yes.

236
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,164
Balls?

237
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,767
My grapes.

238
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:58,934
Your grapes?

239
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,169
My...

240
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,188
Your testicles.

241
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,193
Your sperm gets squozen,
and then you can't have babies,

242
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,112
and I thought that
you said that you wanted to have babies.

243
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,948
There you go. I said it.

244
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,244
To babies!

245
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,081
To diapers.

246
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,024
To diaper rash.

247
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,919
To breast-feeding. And to crying.

248
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,384
Look at it!

249
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:15,928
Do you see that?

250
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,246
What?

251
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,432
This letter has three typing errors in it,

252
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,767
one of which is, I believe, a spelling error.

253
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,812
I'm... I'm sorry.

254
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,156
This isn't the first time, either.

255
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,941
There've been others that I let go
because it was in the first few weeks.

256
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,860
This cannot go on.

257
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:34,029
Do you know what this makes me look like
to the people who receive these letters?

258
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,866
I... I'm sorry. I'm...

259
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,202
Type it again and get it right.

260
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,889
You're wasting my time.

261
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,165
Bye.

262
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,700
Go type up a bill for that woman for $500.

263
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,786
Aren't you going to proofread the letter?

264
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,304
Lee.

265
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,352
When people come into this office,

266
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,772
you are a visual representation
of my business.

267
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,358
And the way you dress is disgusting.

268
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,489
I'm sorry.

269
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:44,034
You're tapping your toe all the time
and playing with your hair.

270
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,078
You're either going to
have to wear a hairnet

271
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,872
or stop playing with your hair.

272
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,794
And another thing,

273
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,048
do you realize that
you are always sniffling?

274
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,968
I... I'm sniffling?

275
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,179
And what is with your tongue

276
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,765
when you're typing?

277
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,436
I'm sorry.
I didn't know I sniffled.

278
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,773
Well, you do.

279
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,616
Mr. Grey,

280
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:30,289
thank you so much for
your helpful suggestions.

281
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,793
Because I am trying to be

282
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:39,632
the very best secretary that I can be.

283
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,468
For you.

284
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,471
The sentence should read,

285
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:49,350
"Without proper guidance
from a knowledgeable source,

286
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,810
"my client would never have made

287
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:55,648
"these material decisions on her own."
Period!

288
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,650
I have repeated the sentence twice.

289
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,947
Why don't you listen, think
and then respond.

290
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,907
Okay?

291
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,459
Are you sure
you wouldn't like some wine?

292
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,754
We make it homemade, don't we, Stewart?

293
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,381
Try it. It's good.

294
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,007
Would you like some, Lee?

295
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,301
No, thank you.

296
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,053
Not right now, Sylvia.

297
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,597
You know,
Peter talks about you all the time.

298
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,183
He says he's found his soul mate.

299
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,770
Did you say that?

300
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,440
I did.

301
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,693
Peter's sister, Lindsey,

302
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,196
is getting married this
coming winter in Vegas.

303
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,534
Did you know Peter has
a very stable job at JC Penney?

304
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,369
They even gave him a cell phone.

305
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,287
Perhaps it'll be a double wedding?

306
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,835
Mom.

307
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,070
Ms. Holloway, come into the library.

308
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,948
Immediately.

309
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,842
"Refer only to slanderous remarks
made in print.

310
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,260
"In summation of the events

311
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,139
"in regard to the Rubin Berkowitz libel.
Yours sincerely, etc."

312
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,920
Okay.

313
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,273
The phone is ringing.

314
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,930
Answer it.

315
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,100
I'm sorry...

316
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,192
Oh.

317
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,379
Hello?

318
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,465
This is the office of...

319
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,699
Listen.

320
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:28,884
You're a big girl.

321
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:32,971
You can get a much bigger voice
out of that tiny throat of yours.

322
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,499
Tiny.

323
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,584
Ms. Holloway.

324
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,770
You told me when I hired you

325
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,356
that you were used to answering phones.

326
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,424
I am.

327
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,361
Did you get enough sleep last night?

328
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,780
- I...
- The phone is ringing!

329
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,409
Hello.

330
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:59,206
This is the office of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

331
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,459
You see? You see?
You see? You see?

332
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,419
That's showing a little spunk.

333
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,338
After all, I'm not running a mortuary.

334
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:07,906
No.

335
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,668
Lee.

336
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,354
Mr. Grey.

337
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,591
Come here.

338
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,596
Did you have a date recently?

339
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,876
Yes.

340
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,564
With whom did you have a date?

341
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,401
- Peter.
- Peter?

342
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,944
Did you have sex?

343
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,557
No?

344
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,912
I don't know.

345
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,875
Are you shy?

346
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,712
I'm shy.

347
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,548
You're not shy.

348
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,717
You're a lawyer.

349
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,096
I'm shy.

350
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,099
I overcome my shyness to...

351
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,104
Ln order to get things done.

352
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,484
I don't think you're shy.

353
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,200
Lee, I want to be frank with you.

354
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:02,621
Now, I know I'm your employer,
and we have

355
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,165
a prescribed relationship.

356
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,298
But you really should feel free

357
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,179
to discuss your problems with me.

358
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,625
Oh.

359
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,694
What's going on
with the sewing kit and the Band-Aids?

360
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,436
Lee?

361
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,041
I feel...

362
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,254
- Shy.
- Shy.

363
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,093
Do you want some hot chocolate?

364
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,203
Okay.

365
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,362
Why do you cut yourself, Lee?

366
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,202
I don't know.

367
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:28,123
Is it that sometimes the pain inside has to
come to the surface,

368
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,417
and when you see evidence
of the pain inside,

369
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,462
you finally know you are really here?

370
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,714
Then, when you watch the wound heal,

371
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,216
it's comforting. Isn't it?

372
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,537
I...

373
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,518
That's a way to put it.

374
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,647
I'm going to tell you something, Lee.
Are you ready to listen?

375
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,008
Yes.

376
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,860
Are you listening?

377
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,406
You will never,

378
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,994
ever cut yourself again.

379
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,246
Do you understand?

380
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:11,500
Have I made that perfectly clear?

381
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,669
You're over that now.

382
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,214
It's in the past.

383
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,746
Yes.

384
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,684
Never again.

385
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,297
Okay.

386
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:39,486
Now, you know what I want you to do?

387
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,282
I want you to leave work early.

388
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,245
You're a big girl, a grown woman.

389
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,144
Your mother doesn't need
to pick you up every day.

390
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:56,378
I want you to take a nice walk home,
in the fresh air.

391
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,630
Because you require relief.

392
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,634
Because you won't be doing that anymore.

393
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,428
Will you?

394
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,763
No, sir.

395
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,125
Good.

396
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,825
Look who's early.

397
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:29,828
Mom,

398
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,416
I'm going to walk home from now on.

399
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,296
I took a shortcut through Hawkins Park,

400
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:44,301
and it was as if I'd never
taken a walk by myself before.

401
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:50,015
And when I thought about it, I realized
I probably never had taken a walk alone.

402
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,768
But because he had given me
the permission to do this,

403
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,104
because he'd insisted I do it,

404
00:46:56,189 --> 00:47:00,901
I felt held by him as I walked along.

405
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,820
I felt he was with me.

406
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:10,952
At the same time, I was feeling
something growing in Mr. Grey,

407
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:16,541
an intimate tendril creeping
from one of his darker areas,

408
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:22,589
nursed on the feeling that he had
discovered something about me.

409
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,136
The next day, I didn't even bring
my cuticle scissors and my iodine.

410
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:31,014
But I did make another typing mistake.

411
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:34,434
What is wrong with you?
That is all you have to do.

412
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,270
Type and answer the phones.
Is that beyond you?

413
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,648
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it certainly seems to be.

414
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:42,150
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me!

415
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:46,071
What goes on inside that head of yours?

416
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,373
Come into my office and bring that letter.

417
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,638
Put the letter on my desk.

418
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:08,778
Now, I want you to bend over the desk,
so you're looking directly at it.

419
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:15,035
Get your face very close to the letter,
and read the letter aloud.

420
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,747
I don't understand.

421
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,499
There's nothing to understand.

422
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:25,211
Put your elbows on the desk, bend over,

423
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,674
get your face close to the letter
and read it aloud.

424
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,937
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

425
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:46,399
"I'm grateful to you for referring..."

426
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,038
Continue.

427
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,441
Um...

428
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,544
Ms. Holloway, read.

429
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,851
"For referring me to your case.

430
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:28,692
"The subject of animal captivity
has been of interest to me for quite a while.

431
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:33,029
"And my secretary has prepared
research material

432
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,157
"that I think you'll find illuminating.

433
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:38,451
"If you would be so kind

434
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,624
"as to send me the June 5th letter
of which we spoke,

435
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:48,503
"my associates and I
will review it immediately."

436
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:53,925
"Please feel free to call me
at your earliest convenience.

437
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,263
"Yours sincerely, E. Edward Grey."

438
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,524
Read it again.

439
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,031
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

440
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,121
"I am grateful to you

441
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,542

"that I think you'll find illuminating."

446
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,399
Now straighten yourself up
and go type it again.

447
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,177
Ms. Holloway. Good letter.

448
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:45,723
Mom?

449
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,161
The lock can come off the cabinet now.

450
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,546
Honey.

451
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,674
- Oh!

452
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:10,199
Replace the light bulb
in the hallway to my office.

453
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,060
120 watts.

454
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,788
- Mr. Grey.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Garvey.

455
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,249
You remember my secretary, Ms. Holloway.

456
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,751
I'm sorry about the typo.

457
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:35,600
It's porterhouse steak,
mashed, no, creamed potatoes,

458
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:39,854
green peas, iced tea and ice cream.

459
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,357
Okay. Just a scoop of creamed potatoes,

460
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:48,863
and a slice of butter, four peas

461
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,950
and as much ice cream
as you'd like to eat, doll.

462
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:38,830
Cosmo's advice for getting your man
to share his feelings more intimately

463
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,958
is to first try some breezy humor.

464
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:48,297
Whatever you do, don't jump
too quickly into relationship talk.

465
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:12,548
I'm your secretary.

466
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:15,801
Just one scoop of creamed potatoes,

467
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,763
one slice of butter,

468
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:23,100
and four peas.

469
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,399
How many inches away...

470
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:35,238
Had you turned off the furnace
before you went down to the basement?

471
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,648
Okay.

472
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,794
Maybe you didn't squeeze it hard enough.

473
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,506
Well, there's
always concern about it bursting.

474
00:59:57,177 --> 01:00:00,263
No! God, no.
I haven't had time to get to that.

475
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:03,975
I'm doing as much as I possibly can.

476
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:12,942
Where was she when
you crawled under the house?

477
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,116
And the lockbox?
Did you cover it with dirt before you left?

478
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,826
Mud upstairs?

479
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,289
No, I'm confused by that.

480
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,165
But...

481
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:33,254
All right. This was the overweight child,
or your nephew from Baltimore?

482
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,923
On the banister.

483
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,224
I have to work.

484
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,148
Okay. Give me a week
and I'll have something for you.

485
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:54,275
I'm sorry, the office has been

486
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,821
overwhelmed.

487
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,368
Mr. Grey, I'm going to go home now.

488
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:10,207
If you need any more typing done,
I could come back later.

489
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:18,549
Thank you, Ms. Holloway, good night.

490
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,267
That'll be all.

491
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,150
Here's just one example.

492
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:40,112
He asked me out to Red Lobster
the other night for a nightcap.

493
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:41,489
- Right.
- Yeah.

494
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:44,700
And yesterday,
he asked if my hose were control-top,

495
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:47,286
and if they were, I certainly didn't need it.

496
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,580
- Your boss?
- Yeah.

497
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,750
You should sue him for sexual harassment.

498
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,044
- I like that idea.
- Hello.

499
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:59,256
My lawyer's representing a woman who's
suing her boss for sexual harassment.

500
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,092
Is he a good lawyer?

501
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,095
He's the best.

502
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,263
"He's the best."

503
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,599
How long will he be there?

504
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,774
Who was that?

505
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,568
He checked himself into the hospital.

506
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,162
Lee?

507
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,379
Yes? Lee?

508
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,907
Hi.

509
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:28,746
I...

510
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,141
I just wanted...

511
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,313
I needed you...

512
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:41,192
I wanted you to...

513
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,655
You need me to what?

514
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:58,501
I just wanted you not to forget
to go over the Lynch papers for tomorrow.

515
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,589
No. I haven't.

516
01:04:05,217 --> 01:04:06,634
That's good.

517
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:11,514
Thank you, Lee.

518
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:05,234
After he turned me away from his house,
he put me back at my old desk,

519
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,112
and he just stopped doing it.

520
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,657
He threw out all his red pens.

521
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:18,789
I kept making typos, but he just
treated me like a regular old secretary.

522
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,749
Are you coming?

523
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,878
After a while,
I began to wonder if that was all I was.

524
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,593
Have we received
any checks from Mr. Garvey?

525
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,177
No, sir.

526
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,014
File these.

527
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:49,028
That's a pretty tie.
But I guess you won't be golfing today.

528
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,637
What?

529
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,197
Your tie.

530
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,366
It has golfers on it.

531
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,274
Right.

532
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,171
Damn it.

533
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,568
Don't be scared.

534
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:20,781
I'm not. I'm...

535
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,710
That's not what I meant.

536
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:41,218
I'm sorry, I just... Look here.

537
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,471
I'm sorry.

538
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:49,726
Okay, but my clothes
get to stay completely on

539
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:51,687
and I want the lights out.

540
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:23,886
Lee, Lee, Lee.

541
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,476
I didn't hurt you, did I?

542
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:35,255
No.

543
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,491
Ms. Holloway.

544
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:13,704
Yes, Mr. Grey?

545
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,706
Come into my office.

546
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,377
But Mr. Marvel is waiting.

547
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:26,049
Ms. Holloway, come into my office.

548
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,551
Yes, sir.

549
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,847
Finally.

550
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,594
Ignore it.

551
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:29,112
Now, pull up your skirt.

552
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:33,225
Why?

553
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:37,162
You're not worried
that I'm going to fuck you, are you?

554
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:41,666
I'm not interested in that, not in the least.

555
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,252
Now, pull up your skirt.

556
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:47,464
Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee

557
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:52,385
Lee?

558
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,974
I said, pull up your skirt.

559
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,270
Peter.

560
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:07,484
I'm not going to be able to
come to the diner today, okay?

561
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:12,681
Okay.

562
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:17,702
That's okay.
Because... That's all right.

563
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:44,855
Pull down your panty hose and underwear.

564
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,529
I told you I'm not going to fuck you.

565
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,371
Get these forms filled out,

566
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,458
and then you can take your lunch break.

567
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:56,004
Bring me my sandwich, I'm eating in.

568
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,802
And you'll have the usual.

569
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,350
No mayonnaise this time.

570
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:13,855
And send in what's his name.

571
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,554
Okay?

572
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,786
Mr. Grey.

573
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:35,103
Cock. Place your prick in my mouth.

574
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,272
Screw me.

575
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,501
Shit. Fuck.

576
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:02,130
Mayonnaise. Orchid.

577
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:05,341
Mr. Grey.

578
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:30,200
Edward.

579
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:54,349
Most people think that
the best way to live is to run from pain.

580
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:58,895
But a much more joyful life
embraces the entire spectrum

581
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,605
of human feeling.

582
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:05,068
If we can fully
experience pain, as well as pleasure,

583
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:09,239
we can live a much deeper
and more meaningful life.

584
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,746
- Ms. Holloway.

585
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,376
Yes, sir?

586
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,962
- Bring your typing scores.
- Okay.

587
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:31,821
What happened?

588
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:35,908
Are you pregnant?

589
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:39,729
No.

590
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:43,666
- Do you plan on getting pregnant?
- Could I...

591
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:45,835
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

592
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:48,946
No.

593
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,674
Are you living in an apartment?

594
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,134
A house.

595
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,136
Alone?

596
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:57,555
With my parents.

597
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:00,808
Are you married?

598
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:03,795
No.

599
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:15,198
Are those your scores?

600
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,142
Yes.

601
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,543
Do you really want to be my secretary?

602
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:31,756
Yes, I do.

603
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,556
This isn't just about typos, tape,
staples and pencils, is it, Lee?

604
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:43,393
- No, sir.
- What?

605
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,062
No, sir.

606
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:54,987
I like you, Lee, but I don't think
I'm going to offer you the job.

607
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:58,891
Why?

608
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:02,495
It's your behavior.

609
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:06,457
What about my behavior?

610
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,084
It's very bad.

611
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:16,134
I'm sorry.
You can collect your things.

612
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,595
- Time-out!
- Time-out?

613
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:21,681
- You're fired.
- You're fired!

614
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,434
You're fired. Now, Lee, get out!

615
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,737
Why did you get glue smear
all over the Ramsey papers?

616
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:38,573
Because I was fixing your shredder.
You saw me.

617
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:41,868
Are you aware
you kick your shoes off under your desk?

618
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:43,661
I can smell your feet.

619
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:45,371
Do you ever change your panty hose?

620
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:46,606
Every day.

621
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:50,710
Every time you erase,
there are little shavings all over your desk.

622
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:54,422
I told you to take that Walkman home.

623
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,676
I don't want the possibility
of your listening to music

624
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:00,386
when you're supposed
to be working for me.

625
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:04,015
I saw it in your desk. I know it's there.

626
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:05,892
I'll move it.

627
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:48,351
You have to go, or I won't stop.

628
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:50,853
Don't.

629
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,567
I cannot do this anymore.

630
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,656
But I want to know you.

631
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:30,810
I'm so sorry for what happened between us.

632
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:37,900
I've realized
what a terrible mistake I made with you.

633
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:43,114
And I can only hope that you understand.

634
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,411
Be assured you can count on me
for excellent references.

635
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:58,087
Get out.

636
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:01,173
- What are you doing...
- Get out!

637
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:20,044
I opened the envelope
the second I got home.

638
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:25,341
It was a check for $680.
More than he actually owed me.

639
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:29,095
It occurred to me to tear up the check,
but I didn't.

640
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:32,348
I felt like I was doing the right thing.

641
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:35,226
And I didn't tell anybody about any of it.

642
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,896
I pretended to go to work as usual,

643
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:42,483
and watched his office
from across the street.

644
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,988
He hired a new girl
and changed the locks on the doors.

645
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,159
There was just nothing
for me to do about it.

646
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:08,926
My doctor at the institution once said,
"Every journey begins with the first step."

647
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:13,264
So I decided it was time
to meet someone new.

648
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,394
There was one who tried
to grab and pinch my nipples

649
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:20,813
before we even made it to his car.

650
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:22,148
Hi.

651
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:25,359
Another guy kept ordering me
to pee on his patio,

652
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,403
and when I refused, he said...

653
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:29,071
I thought you were a masochist.

654
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:32,241
Then there was the one
who liked being tied to a gas stove

655
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:36,328
while the burners were on full blast,
and I had to throw tomatoes at him.

656
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:37,663
Thank you.

657
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:41,083
For a while I just stopped trying
and stayed at home,

658
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:44,086
helping Dad adjust to his new sobriety.

659
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,380
Until one day,

660
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:50,342
out of the blue,
Peter proposed marriage to me

661
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:52,845
in the basement of JC Penney's.

662
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:57,600
I think I said yes
because I didn't know what else to do.

663
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:01,228
Well, I guess I was a little lighter
than you in those days.

664
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:03,064
Okay.

665
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:08,402
Now, if you hold your breath
through the wedding, you'll make it.

666
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:10,529
Don't move. I'm going to get Stewart.

667
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:13,449
You're beautiful.
You're just too beautiful.

668
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,100
Lee?

669
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:41,769
No! I'm not supposed
to see you before the wedding!

670
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:43,896
Where are you going?

671
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:01,956
- I have something to say to you.
- Lee.

672
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:03,749
I love you.

673
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,877
Lee, you should not be here.

674
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:08,337
I love you.

675
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:25,688
I'm sorry,
but I don't believe that to be true.

676
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:28,774
Well, it is true. Lt is.

677
01:31:31,862 --> 01:31:33,612
This matter was resolved

678
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:36,740
when I received
your canceled severance check.

679
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:40,161
I love you.

680
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:46,208
We can't do this 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

681
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,751
Why not?

682
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:05,561
Put both your hands on the desk.
Palms down.

683
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:16,113
I want to make love.

684
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:26,290
Keep both your feet on the floor
until I come back.

685
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:17,549
Hello?

686
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:20,803
In case you're wondering,
your fiancée is at my office.

687
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:57,464
Lee, I'm very fond of you as well.

688
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:05,931
Oh, it's you.

689
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:16,984
What are you...
What are you doing?

690
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:20,946
Lee, I don't...
I don't know what the deal is with...

691
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:23,949
I'm sorry,
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

692
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:28,704
I'm your fiancée, Lee!

693
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,873
You are trespassing.

694
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:34,626
You are making an unwarranted incursion,

695
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:38,255
a gradual or stealthy
entrance into the sphere of another.

696
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,553
Okay, Lee, Lee,

697
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:51,226
are you doing something sexual right now?

698
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:54,521
Does this look sexual to you?

699
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:58,776
I don't know, Lee!

700
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:02,363
Why don't you move your hands?

701
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:08,410
Because I don't want to.

702
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:13,607
No!

703
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:49,701
Peter, I don't want you.

704
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:56,542
Now, get out.

705
01:35:58,461 --> 01:35:59,670
Get out.

706
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:03,799
Get out!

707
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,630
- Here you go.
- Great.

708
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:47,342
I brought you some peas.

709
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:56,977
There are no statutes capable of controlling
the relations between men and women.

710
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:59,188
There are other ways to show
your feelings, Lee.

711
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:01,607
More conventional ways.

712
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:05,694
I expect that dress back,
dry-cleaned, in perfect condition.

713
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:09,114
I'm just going to leave you
with this literature.

714
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:13,494
Why don't you read about
women's struggle first?

715
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:33,597
You know, Lee, there's a long
history of this in Catholicism.

716
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:37,684
The monks used to wear thorns
on their temples.

717
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:41,772
And the nuns, they wore them
sewn inside their clothing.

718
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:45,484
Two years ago, when it didn't work out
between us, that was it.

719
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,528
I let him slip through my fingers.

720
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:50,405
You are part of a great tradition.

721
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:51,990
I admire you, Ms. Holloway.

722
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:55,953
Without question, he is the most
isolated man I have ever known.

723
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:58,205
The worm. Amazing.

724
01:37:58,331 --> 01:38:01,542
Who's to say that love needs to be
soft and gentle?

725
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:06,088
"You are the child of God's holy gift of life.

726
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:10,759
"You come from me, but you are not me.

727
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:18,392
"Your soul and your body are your own,
and yours to do with as you wish."

728
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:23,605
Thank you, Daddy.

729
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,249
Drinks.

730
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:44,585
Take what you ordered.

731
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:47,796
Now don't take anybody else's drink.
What you ordered.

732
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:53,594
<i>Fifty-seven bottles of beer on the wall</i>

733
01:38:55,138 --> 01:39:00,058
<i>Fifty-seven bottles of beer</i>

734
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:04,730
<i>Take one down...</i>

735
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:22,289
We're here on day three
of what has come to be known

736
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:25,042
as the Lee Holloway hunger strike.

737
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:28,211
Now, you may have heard
that there are those in the community

738
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:32,090
who wonder if Ms. Holloway is even willing
to starve herself to death.

739
01:39:36,346 --> 01:39:39,514
In one way or another,
I've always suffered.

740
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:41,850
I don't know why, exactly.

741
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:46,438
But I do know that I'm not so scared
of suffering now.

742
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:49,775
I feel more than I've ever felt,

743
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:56,531
and I've found someone to feel with,
to play with, to love

744
01:39:57,784 --> 01:40:00,744
in a way that feels right for me.

745
01:40:01,663 --> 01:40:04,956
I hope he knows that
I can see that he suffers, too.

746
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,751
And that I want to love him.

747
01:42:40,196 --> 01:42:46,701
Each cut, each scar, each burn,
a different mood or time.

748
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,038
I told him what the first one was.

749
01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:53,208
I told him where the second one came from.

750
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:55,252
I remembered them all.

751
01:42:56,337 --> 01:42:58,713
And for the first time in my life,

752
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:01,800
I felt beautiful.

753
01:43:02,969 --> 01:43:05,011
Finally part of the earth.

754
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:10,851
I touched the soil, and he loved me back.

755
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,749
Where did you go to high school?

756
01:43:37,795 --> 01:43:39,838
What was your mother like?

757
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:43,758
What was her name?

758
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:52,893
What did it say under
your senior yearbook picture?

759
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:59,524
Who was your first love?

760
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:08,283
When did your heart first get broken?

761
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:16,750
Where were you born?

762
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,218
Des Moines, Iowa.

763
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:52,869
All our activities melted
into an everyday sort of life

764
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:56,539]
770
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:21,064
Then, we honeymooned in the mountains.

771
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:25,610
We only had the weekend
because Edward had to get back to work.
