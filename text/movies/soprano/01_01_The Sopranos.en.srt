1
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,086
Mr. Soprano?

2
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,589
Yeah.

3
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,101
Have a seat.

4
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,633
My understanding
from dr. Cusamano,

5
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,636
your family physician,
is that you collapsed.

6
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,138
Possibly
a panic attack.

7
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,140
You were
unable to breathe.

8
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,142
They said it was
a panic attack...

9
00:02:56,142 --> 00:03:00,897
'cause the blood work
and neurological work
came back negative.

10
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:04,400
And they sent me here.

11
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,536
You don't agree
that you had a panic attack.

12
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,041
How are you feeling now?

13
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,043
Good.

14
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:17,547
Fine.
Back at work.

15
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,549
What line of work
are you in?

16
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,669
Waste management consultant.

17
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:32,679
Look, it's impossible
for me to talk
to a psychiatrist.

18
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,683
Any thoughts at all
on why you blacked out?

19
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,188
I dunno. Stress, maybe.

20
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,692
About what?

21
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:54,617
I don't know.

22
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:57,620
The morning
of the day i got sick,
i'd been thinking.

23
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:03,126
It's good to be in something
from the ground floor.

24
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:06,129
I came too late for that.
I know.

25
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:10,133
But lately,
i'm gettin' the feelin'
that i came in at the end.

26
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,135
The best is over.

27
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:16,639
Many americans, i think,
feel that way.

28
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,144
I think about my father. He
never reached heights like me.

29
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:24,647
But in a lot of ways,
he had it better.
He had his people.

30
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:27,650
They had their standards.
They had pride.

31
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,653
Today, what do we got?

32
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:38,911
Did you have these feelings of
loss more acutely in the hours
before you collapsed?

33
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:42,165
I don't know.

34
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,932
- A couple of
months before,

35
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,069
these two wild ducks
landed in my pool.

36
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,574
It was amazing. They're
from canada or some place,
and it was matin' season.

37
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,077
They had some ducklings.

38
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,836
Here you go.
Here you go.

39
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,460
My daughter's friend was there
to drive my daughter, meadow,
to school.

40
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,962
Meadow, your father
with those ducks.

41
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,965
I know. The whole yard
smells like duck poop.
It's embarrassing.

42
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:38,104
Girls, you gotta have more
than just cranberry juice.
You need brain food.

43
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,607
Happy birthday! Thirteen.
He doesn't act it.

44
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,610
The male and female duck
made a home in your pool
and did it.

45
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,114
- Eeew. Get outta here.
- Disgusting.

46
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:52,118
Girls, you want some
of last night'ssfogliatell?

47
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:56,873
- Get outta here with that fat.
- One bite.
- How do you stay so skinny?

48
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,628
Him with those ducks.

49
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,999
If you don't like that ramp,
i'll build you another one.
Maybe it's the wood.

50
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:13,005
Hey, kids, come here!
They're trying to fly!

51
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,509
- Come here. The babies--
they're trying to fly. -

52
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,011
look!
They're trying to fly.

53
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:22,765
National geographic, dad.
Super.

54
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:26,402
You showed us yesterday.
It's great!

55
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:30,773
Now, my wife feels this friend
is a bad influence.

56
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:34,277
That's so cool you're gonna
be able to come to aspen
with my family at christmas.

57
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,279
Last year,
i saw skeet ulrich.

58
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,781
As close as from
where you're sitting.
Oh, my god.

59
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,783
Miss meadow,
we made a deal--

60
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,286
you keep your school grades up
and you keep your curfew...

61
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:45,788
between now and christmas,
then you get to go.

62
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:47,790
I know that.

63
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,792
Good morning, ladies.
Hey, mr. Soprano.

64
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,295
We're late, dad.
Hey! Happy birthday.

65
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,797
Thanks, dad.

66
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:05,308
You're gonna be home
for anthony junior's
birthday party, right?

67
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,312
Bird man, hello.

68
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:12,315
Yeah. Yeah. I'll
get home early from work.

69
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:15,318
I'm not
talking about work.

70
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,573
This isn't gonna work.
I can't talk
about my personal life.

71
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,576
Finish telling me
about the day you collapsed.

72
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:31,968
I drove to work
with my nephew, christopher.
He's learning the business.

73
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,970
He's an example of what
i was talking about before.

74
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,975
Did you call what's- his- name
at triboro towers
about the hauling contract?

75
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:43,980
I got home too late
last night. I didn't
want to wake the man up.

76
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,984
Did you get up early
this morning and call?
He's in his office by 6:00.

77
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:51,988
I was nauseous this morning.
My mother told me i
shouldn't even come in.

78
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:56,108
Bear in mind,
this is a kid who just
bought himself a $60, 000 lexus.

79
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,617
There's that guy mahaffey.
Get out.

80
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,120
Yeah, right there
next to the boo- boo in pink.

81
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,122
Back up.

82
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:25,638
My friend mahaffey.
Pulling his taffy.
Hello.

83
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,892
We saw this guy,
and there was this issue
of an oustandin' loan.

84
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:33,279
Can i stop you for a second?

85
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,781
I don't know where
this story is going.

86
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,285
But there are a few
ethical ground rules...

87
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,788
we should quickly
get out of the way.

88
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:48,294
What you
tell me here falls under
doctor/patient confidentiality.

89
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,798
Except, if i was, uh--
if i was to hear,

90
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,801
let's say, a murder
was to take place.

91
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,803
Not that i'm saying it would,
but if--

92
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:02,308
if a patient comes to me
and tells me a story where
someone's going to get hurt,

93
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,810
i'm supposed to go
to the authorities.

94
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,813
Technically.

95
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,936
You said you were
in waste management.

96
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:18,824
- Environment.
- Dr. Cusamano, besides
being your family physician,

97
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,078
is also your
next- door neighbor.

98
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:24,580
See what i'm saying?

99
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,083
I don't know what happened
with this fellow,

100
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,585
i- i'm just saying.

101
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:34,707
Nothing. We had coffee.

102
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:40,596
- Help!
-

103
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:49,221
security! Help!
- Aw, shit!

104
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:11,744
- Asshole!
-

105
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,749
tony! Wait up!

106
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:26,642
Security!
Hey, security!

107
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:51,167
You all right?

108
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,669
My leg is broken!
The bone's coming
through.

109
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:55,671
Oh, let me see.

110
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:59,425
I'll give you
a fuckin' bone, you prick!
Where's my fuckin' money?

111
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,678
- So you had coffee.
- Right.

112
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:06,682
- ...your fuckin' face,
motherfucker!
-

113
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:14,190
- what are you doing? Get
over here! Get over here!
- That's $3, 000. $3, 000.

114
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,692
Go ahead.

115
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:22,198
- Where's our fuckin' money?
- I'll get the money.

116
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,316
I know you'll get
the fuckin' money.

117
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,318
Know what you should get?
A cork in your fuckin' mouth,
'cause you tell people...

118
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,821
i'm nothing
compared to the people
that used to run things.

119
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:31,824
I'm sorry!
- You prick! -

120
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,828
i'm nothing?

121
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,833
Shut up!

122
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,086
What are you crying about?
H. M. O.!

123
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:46,589
Huh?
You're covered, you prick!

124
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,092
Degenerate fuckin' gambler.

125
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:51,727
Go on.

126
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,230
Next day,
i had a breakfast meeting.

127
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,233
I was called in to consult
by a garbage company
i represent.

128
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,485
Big, what's the story
with triboro towers?

129
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,738
The site manager wants to
renew his contract with dick,

130
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,356
but this kolar
sanitation--

131
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,358
another nationwide company.

132
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,863
The kolar brothers, some kind
of czechoslovakian immigrants.

133
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,365
These polacks, they'll haul
paper, plastic and aluminum...

134
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,868
for 7, 000 a month
less than dick.

135
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,504
So they pay us
40 times the monthly
for stealin' your stop.

136
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,506
That's the thing--
they won't.

137
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:24,009
He says if he can
tell commie bosses
in czechoslovakia...

138
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,012
to go fuck themselves,
he can fuckin' tell us.
Oh!

139
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,882
I give up.
Fuckin' garbage
business.

140
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,384
Yeah, i know.
It's all changing.

141
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,386
Let me see what i can do.

142
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,523
Are you sure?
You over your stomachache?

143
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,525
Oh, yeah.
Good.

144
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,528
What are you
doin' here?
Hey.

145
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,532
Gabriella sends me down here
for thecapicollo.
Best in the area.

146
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,150
Hey, t,
let me ask you something--

147
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:51,654
you used to go to school
with a guy named artie bucco?

148
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,040
This situation came up.
It involves my uncle.

149
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,042
I can't go into details
on this one.

150
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,545
That's fine.
But i will say this:

151
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,915
My uncle adds
to my general stress level.

152
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:07,169
It's none of my business,
but down at the club...

153
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,674
word is your uncle junior
is gonna whack pussy malanga.

154
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,813
He's gonna do it at your friend
artie bucco's restaurant.

155
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,942
Hey, boys.
How are you?

156
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,447
Don't move.
Uncle jun',
how you doin'?

157
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,951
Hey, good to see you.

158
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,953
Hiya, chris.
Hey, uncle junior.

159
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,955
I was just
talking about you.

160
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,957
It's anthony junior's
birthday dinner tonight?

161
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,459
Yeah. Don't
buy anything big.

162
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,963
We overindulge him,
okay?

163
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,966
Hey!
Oh! Artie,
how's your rash?

164
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,968
It's itchy.
Come here.

165
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:00,856
Good to see you.
Can you come over?
Yeah. Have a seat.

166
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:07,863
You know what it means for
arthur, one of these old mutts
gets wet in here?

167
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:10,866
Yeah. It'll
ruin his business.

168
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,369
You better sit down
with your uncle.

169
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,490
Uncle junior's
my father's brother.

170
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,493
Good guy.
Just gettin' old. Cranky.

171
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,332
Used to take me to yankee games
when i was a kid.

172
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,717
I love my uncle.

173
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:32,721
At the same time,
when i was young,

174
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:36,225
he told my girl cousins i would
never be a varsity athlete,
and frankly,

175
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:40,229
that was a tremendous blow
to my self- esteem.

176
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:06,622
Who's there?
It's me, ma.

177
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:09,124
Who are you?

178
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:12,127
Ma, open the door.

179
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,633
Anthony?
Yeah, it's me.
Open the door.

180
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:25,140
Hi, how are you?

181
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,777
Geez, ma,
get some air in here.

182
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:31,280
You lock the door
after you?

183
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,285
Yeah. I did.
Somebody called here
last night after dark.

184
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:40,289
Who?
You think i'd answer?
It was dark out.

185
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,291
Ma, i'll never
understand that.

186
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,294
The phone is an auditory thing.
Dark is an eye thing.

187
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:47,796
I can understand
not going out after dark,

188
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:49,798
but not answering
the phone after dark?

189
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:52,301
Oh, listen to him.
He knows everything.

190
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,803
You want some lunch?
I got eggplant.

191
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:56,805
No. No.
I just ate.

192
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:59,308
Know who i just ran into?
Uncle jun'.

193
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:04,813
You think he ever
comes to see
his sister- in- law?

194
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,815
Yeah. Remember
artie bucco?

195
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:09,818
Kid i went
to elementary school with?
Artie!

196
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:12,321
Oh! Yeah, i still
see his mother.

197
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:19,828
She tells me
he calls her
every day.

198
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:22,331
Yeah. Well.

199
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,333
Uncle jun's gonna
make a problem for artie.

200
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,335
Could affect
his livelihood.
What's that?

201
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:28,837
Cd player.

202
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:31,790
For who?
For me?
Yeah.

203
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,293
I don't want it.
You don't want it?

204
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,795
You love music. All the old
stuff is being reissued on cd.

205
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,799
All your old favorites.
Pajama game, connie francis.

206
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,801
Here.

207
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,811
Come on.
Come on.
What? What?

208
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,317
Ma, you need something
to occupy your mind.

209
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,321
When dad died, you were going
to do all kinds of things.
Oh, he was a saint.

210
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,823
Yeah, i know he was,
but he's gone.

211
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,826
You were gonna travel,
get a volunteer job.

212
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,829
Stop tellin' me
how to live my life.
Just shut up.

213
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:16,335
- I just worry about you.
- Don't start with that
nursing home again.

214
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:20,339
It's not a nursing home!
It's a retirement community.

215
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,343
You're with active seniors
your own age. You go places.
You do things.

216
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:29,848
I've seen these women in these
nursing homes in wheelchairs
babbling like idiots.

217
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,353
- Here, eat your eggplant.
- I told you, i already
ate lunch.

218
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,858
All right, listen.

219
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,861
You just speak to uncle junior
about artie, okay?

220
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,364
He respects you.
He'll listen to you.

221
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,866
If your uncle has business
with arthur,

222
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,369
he knows what he's doing.

223
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,007
And i don't?

224
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,510
Well, all i know is...

225
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:03,132
daughters are better at
taking care of their mothers
than sons.

226
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:06,135
Yeah, and i bought cds
for a broken record.

227
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,893
I expect to see you tonight at
anthony junior's birthday party
with your baked ziti.

228
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,896
Only if i'm picked up
and brought back home.

229
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,400
I don't drive
when they're
predicting rain.

230
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,902
You're a healthy girl.
It's good for you to drive.

231
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,405
Use it or lose it.
I gotta go to work.

232
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,408
Sure. Run off.

233
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,746
And that night
was my son's birthday party.

234
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,249
My wife invites the priest.
He's always at the house.

235
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,251
Hey, tony.
How you doin'?

236
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,753
You likecreme anglais?
You bless it,
i'll eat it.

237
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,756
She's not coming.
Grandma just called.
Who?

238
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,758
She started crying
and hung up.

239
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,760
She needs
a purpose in life.

240
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,762
Your mother is tougher
than you think.

241
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,765
So what?
No fuckin' ziti now?
Hey!

242
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:29,017
At first, it felt like
ginger ale in my skull.

243
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,029
Mom, daddy just fell! Mom!

244
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,534
Tony!
Dad!

245
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:48,537
Get back!
Madonna mia!

246
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:51,039
Daddy! Dad!

247
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,543
Anthony jr. , call 911.

248
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:09,057
Dr. Cusamano
put me in the hospital.

249
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,009
Gave me every kind of test.

250
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:15,597
When you're in the m. R. I. ,
there's a microphone if
you get claustrophobia.

251
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:20,919
I suggest you don't do that
because we have to start
over from the beginning.

252
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,905
Okay.

253
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,827
Hey, carm.

254
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,333
I thought you might
want some company.

255
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,452
Yeah.

256
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,955
6:30 in the morning.

257
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:43,458
How are the kids?

258
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,961
They're worried
about you.

259
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:50,215
I told anthony jr.
We'd rain- check his birthday.
Okay.

260
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,224
Think i got a brain tumor?

261
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,226
Well, we're gonna
find out.

262
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,730
What a bedside manner.
Very encouraging.

263
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,115
What are you gonna?
Not know?

264
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,988
We had some good times.

265
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,991
Had some good years.
Here he goes
with the nostalgia.

266
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,377
Hey, all i'm sayin'
is no marriage is perfect.

267
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,379
Well, havin' that
gumaon the side helps.

268
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:22,631
I told you i'm not
seeing her anymore.

269
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:25,751
- How do you think i feel
having that priest around?
- Don't even go there!

270
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,253
Father is
a spiritual mentor.

271
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,255
He's helping me
to be a better catholic.

272
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,258
Yeah. Well, we all
got different needs.

273
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:37,396
What's different between
you and me is you're going
to hell when you die!

274
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,915
My nephew christopher...

275
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,418
was handling
the garbage contract problem.

276
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:03,922
But on this,
i will also not go into detail.

277
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:23,442
Emile kolar.
Chris moltisante.

278
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,446
In czech republic, too,
we love pork.

279
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,948
You ever have
our sausages?

280
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:34,953
No. I thought the only
sausages was italian
and jimmy dean's.

281
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,457
See what you learn
when you cross cultures
and shit.

282
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,460
My uncle evzen
doesn't know i came.

283
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,962
If we make progress,
i'll have to tell him.

284
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,467
We have
to make progress,"e- mail."
We gotta stop the madness.

285
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,969
The garbage business
is changing.

286
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,973
You and i of
the younger generation,
we have issues in common.

287
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:59,478
"Emile."
Where'd you go
to high school?

288
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:03,482
Was it poland?
I'm not polish.

289
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,985
Czechoslovakian, what's that?
A type of polack, right?

290
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,489
We came to this country
when i was nine.
I went to west essex.

291
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,491
Yo, money. You used to play
my cousin in football.

292
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,993
- He went to boon--
- where's the stuff?

293
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,496
Yes. Yes, yes.

294
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,999
The reason for the visit.

295
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,503
I got it all deployed
for you.

296
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,872
Taste the wares,"e- mail."

297
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,874
"Emile."

298
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:56,151
The doctors kept me hangin'
about the tests.

299
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:58,653
As doctors will do.

300
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:02,157
So my uncle and i played a round
of golf and had lunch.

301
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:06,044
You keep mentioning your uncle.
What seems to be the problem?

302
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:10,048
Who do you think you are?
The person who says
how things go.

303
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:13,051
Now, listen,
artie's business...

304
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,053
is nice, upscale people
from the suburbs.

305
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,055
Don't ruin his life.

306
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,558
Vesuvio is where pussy
feels safe.

307
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,560
He's been eating here
all his life.

308
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,563
Hey, you kill him
someplace else.

309
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:28,066
You may run north jersey,
but you don't run
your uncle junior.

310
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:32,070
How many fuckin'
hours did i play
catch with you?

311
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,694
Can we focus more
on your immediate family?

312
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:42,197
My wife and my daughter
were not getting along.

313
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:46,084
Your husband
plowed under his corn
to build a baseball field.

314
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,587
These laser discs
are incredible.

315
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,591
Tony watchesgodfather ii
all the time.

316
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,093
He says the camera work
looks as good as in the theater.

317
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,596
Gordon willis. Tony
prefersii, noti?

318
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,599
Yeah. He likes the part
where vito goes back to sicily.

319
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,101
Iiiwas, like,
what happened?

320
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,103
Where does tony
rankgoodfellas?

321
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,107
Do you have racoons?

322
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,610
Somebody's
jimmying the window.
What?

323
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,113
You have all these
security lights.
Who would try--

324
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:19,117
oh, no.
Geez louise.

325
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:20,869
Hold it!

326
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,488
Meadow.

327
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:28,627
I notice the glass rattles
every time i walk
to the laundry room.

328
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,629
Do we have any,
what- ya- call- it, putty?

329
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,131
Don't give me that.
You snuck out!

330
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:37,135
- What's going on?
- You locked my bedroom window
on purpose so i'd get caught.

331
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,139
Normal people thought
you were doing your homework!

332
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:44,142
You have become a master
of lying and conniving.

333
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:45,894
Yeah, i know i'm grounded,

334
00:25:46,394 --> 00:25:48,897
but patrick's swim meet
is tomorrow and he needed me!

335
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:53,151
Grounded for this?
Oh, no, you're not grounded.

336
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,905
You're not going
to aspen, that's where
you're not going.

337
00:25:56,905 --> 00:25:58,657
Yes!

338
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:02,410
But this shit i'm tellin' ya,
it'll all blow over.

339
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:06,915
Didn't you admit
to dr. Cusamano...

340
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:09,417
that you were
feeling depressed?

341
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,431
Melfi.

342
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:26,434
What part of the boot
you from, hon?

343
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:29,437
Dr. Melfi.

344
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:32,440
My father's people
were from caserta.

345
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,442
Avellino.

346
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:37,445
My mother would've loved it
if you and i got together.

347
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:49,324
Anxiety attacks are legitimate
psychiatric emergencies.

348
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:51,326
Suppose you were driving
and you passed out?

349
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:55,330
Let me tell you something.
Nowadays, everybody's
gotta go to shrinks...

350
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,834
and counselors and go on
sally jesse raphael
and talk about their problems.

351
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:03,338
Whatever happened
to gary cooper?

352
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:06,841
The strong, silent type.
That was an american.

353
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:08,843
He wasn't in touch
with his feelings.

354
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:10,845
He just did
what he had to do.

355
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:13,348
See, what they didn't know
is once they got gary cooper...

356
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:16,351
in touch with his feelings,
they wouldn't be able
to shut him up.

357
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:18,853
Then it's dysfunction
this and that,
dysfunctionvaffancul!

358
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:23,358
You have strong feelings
about this.

359
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:25,360
I had a semester
and a half of college.

360
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,364
I understand freud.
I understand therapy
as a concept.

361
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:31,866
But in my world,
it does not go down.

362
00:27:33,868 --> 00:27:37,372
Could i be happier?
Yeah. Who couldn't?

363
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:40,375
Do you feel depressed?

364
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:44,379
Do you feel depressed?

365
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:54,389
Since the ducks left.
I guess.

366
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:58,393
The ducks that preceded
your losing consciousness.

367
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:01,396
Let's talk about them.

368
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:18,046
You can't blame t
for being pissed.
You whacked this kid.

369
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:20,548
You should've waited.
That's the last time
i show initiative.

370
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:23,051
Imagine how i felt?

371
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,053
T's running down
the garbage business;

372
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:27,055
i wet a guy to hold on
to one of our stops.

373
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:31,426
He's not running
it down. It's getting
harder in new york.

374
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:37,432
One, two, three!

375
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:39,434
Come on!

376
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:43,188
- This is fucked up.
- What, pussy?

377
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,690
The kolar uncle is gonna
find the kid dead
in one of his bins...

378
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,693
and get out of our
fuckin' business?

379
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,196
No way.
"Louis brasi
sleeps with the fishes."

380
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:56,201
- Luca brasi. Luca.
- Whatever.

381
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,204
There's differences,
christopher, okay,

382
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,207
from the luca brasi
situation and this.

383
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,711
Look, the kolars
know the kid is dead,

384
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,713
it hardens
their position.

385
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,216
Plus, now, the cops
are looking
for a murderer.

386
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,218
So, what do you wanna do?

387
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,721
He disappears.
He never comes home.

388
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,224
They know,
but they don't know.

389
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,727
They hope maybe
he'll turn up...if.

390
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:26,231
Yeah. Yeah.
Come on.
Let's get'im.

391
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,734
Take'im
to staten island.
I'll cut'im up.

392
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,736
All right.
Let's go.

393
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,739
Pussy, you know,
t collapsing
at the birthday--

394
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,743
what would you do
if he was disabled?

395
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,995
Why would you
even ask that?

396
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:45,467
Our lecture series
in action.

397
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:50,472
It's someone from the university
discussing the novels
of zora neale hurston.

398
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:52,974
Hmm!

399
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:55,477
Didn't you just
read her in school, med?

400
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:58,480
It's very nice.

401
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:06,488
You know, grandma,
this place
is pretty neat.

402
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,990
You should really
think about it.

403
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,493
This room
was renovated last year.

404
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:13,995
What goes on
behind there?

405
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,998
Those doors lead
to our nursing unit.

406
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,118
Thisis
a nursing home!

407
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,120
This is a residence,
but just in case--

408
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,124
no, you are not
getting me into--
you're not listening.

409
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,128
You're not listening, ma.
I know these women
in their wheelchairs.

410
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,630
Ma, you're not
listening.

411
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,133
Ma.
You think
you're so high and mighty.

412
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,635
With your fancy office.
Ma!

413
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,139
Ma!
People come here
to die.

414
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,645
Oh, my god!
Tony!

415
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,899
Somebody get a doctor.
Dad!

416
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,792
So, you've come back
for help.

417
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,294
Don't look at that
as a defeat.

418
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,797
She's part of
that generation that grew up
during the depression.

419
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,299
But the depression to her
was a trip to six flags.

420
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,302
There's that
"d" word again.

421
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,310
Stay with your mother.

422
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:28,319
Now that my father's dead,
he's a saint.

423
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,322
When he was alive,
nothing.

424
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:39,781
My dad was tough.
He ran his own crew.

425
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:44,285
A guy like that,
and my mother wore him down
to a little nub.

426
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:48,790
He was a squeaking
little gerbil when he died.

427
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,794
Quite a formidable
maternal presence.

428
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:58,266
I gotta be honest
with you, um,

429
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:01,269
i'm not getting any satisfaction
from my work either.

430
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:03,271
Why?

431
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:08,276
- Well, because of rico.
- Is he your brother?

432
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:11,779
- No, the rico statutes?
- Oh, of course.

433
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:15,783
You read the papers?
The government's using
electronic surveillance...

434
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:19,287
and various legal strategies
to squeeze my business.

435
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,744
Do you have any qualms
about how you actually
make a living?

436
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,747
Yeah.

437
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,252
I find i have
to be the sad clown.

438
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,255
Laughing on the outside,

439
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,258
crying on the inside.

440
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,761
See, things
are trending downward.

441
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,764
Used to be a guy got pinched,
he took his prison jolt
no matter what.

442
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,716
Everybody upheld
the code of silence.

443
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:53,237
Nowadays, no values.

444
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:56,741
Guys today have no room
for the penal experience.

445
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,743
So everybody
turns government witness.

446
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,583
I feel exhausted
just talking about it.

447
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,585
Well,

448
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:11,589
with today's pharmacology,
no one needs to suffer...

449
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:15,593
with feelings of
exhaustion and depression.

450
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:20,214
Here we go.
Here comes the prozac.

451
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:31,976
Mahaffey does not
have the money.
What do you mean?

452
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,479
- Mahaffey does not
have the money.
- How could he not?

453
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,865
- The man does not
have the money.
- We ran the man over.

454
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:41,486
- T himself.
- The man has no wiggle room.

455
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,988
He's bled dry.

456
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,994
So, uh,

457
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:52,997
i hear that junior
wants to whack
pussy bompensiero.

458
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,750
- Pussy malanga.
- Oh, little pussy.

459
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,754
You think he's going to fuck
with big pussy? My pussy?

460
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:03,257
Andrea.

461
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:06,761
Stay with drinks on the house--
all night.

462
00:34:07,261 --> 00:34:09,263
Sorry, mr. Dante.
Sorry.

463
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:11,766
So, uh...

464
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,269
your uncle resents
that you're the boss.

465
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:16,771
Sadness accrues.

466
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:19,524
Your uncle's
had a hard- on
his whole life.

467
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,527
First against
your father,
his younger brother,

468
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:26,030
'cause he was a
made man before him,
and now you.

469
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,535
So, sure,
he can't stomach your
telling him what to do.

470
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,037
Hesh, i love the man.

471
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,174
The man is driven,
in toto, by his insecurities.

472
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,544
I feel bad i was the messenger.

473
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,048
Your friend, artie,
with the restaurant,

474
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:46,934
get him out of town
for three weeks.

475
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,936
That way,
the restaurant closes,

476
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:52,440
the hit has to go down
someplace else.

477
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,944
You old fuckin' jew.
No wonder my old man
kept you around so long.

478
00:34:56,944 --> 00:35:00,448
What about this jew's 250
on mahaffey's 100?

479
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:08,456
All right, mahaffey has
a new business partner: You.

480
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:13,961
H. M. O. S pay out millions
to doctors, hospitals,
whatever the fuck.

481
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:17,465
That m. R. I. I had,
$2, 000 a pop.

482
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:21,469
Now, we
give this mahaffey a choice.
He either has his company...

483
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:25,473
start payin' out phoney claims
to fake clinics we set up...

484
00:35:25,973 --> 00:35:29,477
or he pays hesh
the 250 grand he owes him--

485
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:32,980
which we know
he cannot do--

486
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:37,735
or it's a rainy night
in lyndhurst.

487
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,739
Very smart.
Could be major.

488
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,743
- Could be as good as garbage.
- Garbage is our bread
and butter.

489
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,746
Was.

490
00:35:57,505 --> 00:36:01,008
Miss meadow!

491
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:08,516
So, med.
I'm not going.

492
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:12,520
Every year on this date
since you were itty- bitty,

493
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,889
mom and meadow
get all dolled up,

494
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:19,894
drive in to new york,
plaza hotel, for tea
under eloise's portrait.

495
00:36:19,894 --> 00:36:23,898
Look. Where's yours?
I have too much homework.

496
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:27,902
It's our little tradition.
We always have so much fun.

497
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:31,405
To tell you the truth,
i felt it was dumb
since i was eight.

498
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:33,908
I just go
because you like it.

499
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:39,413
And here i thought
this was something
we would do...

500
00:36:39,413 --> 00:36:43,918
long after you got married
with girls of your own.

501
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:46,921
Hopefully i won't
be living here by then.

502
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,173
You've got mail.

503
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:54,929
Meadow, you can't just lie
and cheat and break the rules
you don't like!

504
00:36:57,932 --> 00:36:59,934
What? You have something
you want to say to me?

505
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,187
Do you have any idea
how much it means...

506
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,189
to go skiing in aspen?

507
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,192
Do you think
that's gonna happen
every year,

508
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,829
like lame tea and scones
at the plaza hotel?

509
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:15,199
Good- bye.

510
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,452
Close my door, please.

511
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:21,455
Artie!
Okay, gimme a drop.

512
00:37:21,455 --> 00:37:24,458
Oh! A drop, not a spurt.
Suave, a drop.

513
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:28,462
Artie. How are you?
Hey!
Stir the meatballs.

514
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:31,465
I wonder if you can
help me out.
What do you need?

515
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:35,720
Cruise, caribbean,
s. S. Sagafjord,
11th through the 29th.

516
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,473
Pair of tickets.
I can't use'em.

517
00:37:39,473 --> 00:37:42,476
Can you take'em
off my hands?
Where'd they come from?

518
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:45,112
- Comps.
- Comps?

519
00:37:45,112 --> 00:37:49,367
- What does that mean,
"comps"?
- As business manager...

520
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,869
for the kitchen
the restaurant workers union,
i administer the dental plan.

521
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,488
You listening to me?
Yeah.

522
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:58,993
A couple of dentists got
together, and in appreciation,
they awarded me these tickets.

523
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:01,495
Problem is,
i can't get away.

524
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:04,999
Here.

525
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:07,001
When's the last time
you got away?

526
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:09,887
Anthony, thank you.
All right.

527
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,896
Mr. Soprano.

528
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:29,657
You cannot accept
a gift like that
from tony soprano.

529
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:32,159
No way.
Listen, charmaine,

530
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,663
if i gotta stick my hand
up the ass of one more lobster
without a break--

531
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:39,667
i'm gonna go postal.
I don't even
want to talk about it.

532
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:43,671
Art, melissa,
it's time to go home.

533
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:46,674
Honey, you have
to get away.

534
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:49,176
Wehave to get away
for the marriage.

535
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:52,179
No! It's bad enough
that these mobsters...

536
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,932
still come in
and patronize the place.

537
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:59,553
- So what? We're not connected.
- Because we
turned down those tickets.

538
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:03,307
But the tickets were comps.
Tony is a labor leader.

539
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,309
Arthur,
please grow up!

540
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,312
Does the mind
not rebel at
any scenario...

541
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:12,316
under which dentists
are sending the don
of new jersey...

542
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,318
first class
on a norwegian
steamship?

543
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,322
Somebody donated
their kneecaps
for those tickets.

544
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:21,208
Herman, there's no way
i can subvert...

545
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,210
my fuckin' company.

546
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,213
Have them
pay claims for m. R. I. S
that never happened?

547
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:28,716
The paperwork
will look just
like the real.

548
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:30,718
How do i not
get caught?

549
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:32,720
I hate to hear you
knocking yourself.

550
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,222
You're a smart guy.
I'm depressed.

551
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:37,224
I'm so depressed
i can't eat, sleep.

552
00:39:37,224 --> 00:39:40,728
You on prozac?
Zoloft.
It's similar.

553
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:43,230
It's supposed to help
with gambling too.
No shit?

554
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,233
This new generation
of antidepressants...

555
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:49,987
are supposed to be useful
against compulsive behaviors.

556
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,989
That's a shame.
A medication comes along...

557
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,992
after gambling gets
your fuckin' hip busted to shit.

558
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,995
I'm trying
not to be cynical.

559
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,998
Your debt and the feeling
surrounding it is the source
of your problems.

560
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:04,869
You know it and i know it.
I'm sorry i haven't
paid you, herman.

561
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:09,006
- I know you are.
- I never meant
to denigrate tony soprano.

562
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,008
Hey, you wanna go
for a walk in the rocks?

563
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,011
The crutches.
I can't--
come on.

564
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:17,515
It's beautiful.
We'll help you.
I go out to think.

565
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,531
Thanks, but no.

566
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,534
Uh...let's try it--

567
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:41,405
what you were sayin' before
with the m. R. I. S?

568
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,432
Dick's lookin' for ya.

569
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,937
Hey, tony. I just heard
from triboro towers.

570
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,940
The kolar brothers
withdrew their bid.

571
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,942
That's good.
That's good.

572
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,945
Listen, by the way,
artie bucco's here to see you.

573
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,947
I gotta go, guys.
Take care.

574
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,957
Artie! Artie,
you all right?

575
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,462
I can't.
What are you
talkin' about?

576
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:42,716
- We discussed this.
You gotta leave town.
- I'm sorry.

577
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:52,359
This is unacceptable!

578
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:54,862
I had an 8:00 reservation
i made two weeks ago.

579
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:57,865
Sir, as i explained,
people are not leaving
their tables,

580
00:41:57,865 --> 00:41:59,867
and there are five parties
ahead of you.

581
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:03,370
What would you like--
can i help you?

582
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:06,373
I tore her a new one.

583
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:10,377
Why don't we go to
another restaurant
and eat?

584
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:13,380
We're here.
Mr. Soprano, how you doin'?

585
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,133
Giuseppe, how you doin'?

586
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:19,637
Hey.
This way.

587
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,644
Sweetie pie, i'm hungry.

588
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,763
- Hey.
- Tony, where are you going?

589
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:33,517
- Hey. How are you?
- Good.

590
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,520
You come here?
When possible.

591
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:42,776
Hey, uh, listen,
those decorating tips
you gave me really work.

592
00:42:42,776 --> 00:42:45,529
Good.

593
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,531
How you doin'?

594
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:54,288
Nils. Nils.

595
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:57,291
Do you know
who that was?

596
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:00,294
Obviously, you do.
Is he a patient?

597
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:02,680
You know i can't say.

598
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:09,303
Decorating tips--
yeah, right.

599
00:43:09,303 --> 00:43:11,305
Nils, shut the fuck up.

600
00:43:11,805 --> 00:43:15,059
Mr. Borglund, they're
setting up your table right now.

601
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,946
Whoa.

602
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:21,949
Who was that woman
tonight at the restaurant?

603
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:23,867
My decorator.

604
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,870
What? You're
redoing the garbage dump?
That's funny.

605
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,373
Hey, you better not be
messin' with that hat!

606
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,878
Goddamn! Come on!
That's j. F. K. 's hat!

607
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,381
I bought it
at that auction.
Gimme that!

608
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,384
Irina, jesus.

609
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:44,888
I know there is something
more intimate
between you and her.

610
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:46,890
Nothing intimate.
We just talk.

611
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,393
Yeah.

612
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:59,019
Mr. Soprano, buonasera.

613
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:01,522
Months we don't see you.
Where you been?

614
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:04,525
Signora carmela.

615
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:12,416
You know, sometimes,
life is good.

616
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,918
Life is often good.

617
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,921
True regaliali,
for example.

618
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,925
You been in good spirits
the last couple days.

619
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,936
Carmela,

620
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,938
something i gotta confess.

621
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:42,946
What are you doing?
Getting my wine in position
to throw in your damn face.

622
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:46,950
You're always with the drama.
You go ahead and confess
already. Get it over with.

623
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,457
I'm on prozac.

624
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,460
Oh. Oh, my god.

625
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,963
I been seein' a therapist.
Oh, my god!

626
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,966
I think that's great!
I think that's wonderful!

627
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,968
I think that's
so gutsy!

628
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,472
All right,
take it easy.
That's wonderful!

629
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,974
You'd think i was
hannibal lecter before.

630
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:13,477
I just think it's great.
Psychology doesn't
address the soul.

631
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:17,481
That's something else.
But this is a start.
I'm gonna shut up now.

632
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:21,485
I'll shut up now.
You're the only person
who knows.

633
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:24,988
The only reason
i'm telling you this
is'cause you're my wife.

634
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,991
You're the only person
on this planet
i'm totally honest with.

635
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:32,496
Oh, please.
Goddamn it, i'm serious.

636
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:36,500
Wrong person finds out, i get
a steel- jacketed antidepressant
in back of the head.

637
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,880
I didn't realize
you were so unhappy.

638
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:56,887
I don't know.
My mother--

639
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:59,273
you told him
about your father, right?

640
00:45:59,273 --> 00:46:02,276
Who?
Your therapist.

641
00:46:02,276 --> 00:46:05,279
Yeah. Yeah, i told him.

642
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:09,783
Oh, good. But your mother
is the one.

643
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:14,788
I don't know.
I feel like lately
my life's out of balance.

644
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:21,795
Our existence on this earth
is a puzzle.

645
00:46:22,296 --> 00:46:25,299
My own daughter hates me.

646
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:27,801
She doesn't hate you, carm.

647
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:30,304
We were best friends.
Mothers and their daughters.

648
00:46:30,804 --> 00:46:33,807
She'll come back to you.

649
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,929
Hello?
Jesus, i got through.

650
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,931
What's the matter,
no social life?

651
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,566
Blow me.

652
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,068
Dad!

653
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,070
I brought you
my primavera.

654
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,573
It's your favorite.

655
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:53,076
Who is it?
Christopher.

656
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:55,329
Friend of ours just got back.
Little pussy malanga,

657
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:59,333
sometimes confused
with fellow mobster
big pussy bompensiero,

658
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:01,335
had just returned
from florida--

659
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:03,837
so it's gonna
go down soon?

660
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:06,089
Don't worry about it.
I got a way
to put it to bed.

661
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:10,210
Come on, meadow!

662
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,596
Go falcons!

663
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,099
So, uh, when do you
need this by?

664
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,101
Right away.

665
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:21,972
Way to go, meadow!
Beautiful. Beautiful.

666
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,974
I think i can get a party
like that together.

667
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:28,228
Side out? That ball
hit the line.
What are you doin', ref?

668
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:36,236
Mom didn't come?
Didn't think
you wanted her to.

669
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:38,238
Car's over there.

670
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:40,240
Hey, mr. Dante.

671
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,242
Hi.
See ya, heather.

672
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:44,244
You guys
played a good game.

673
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:46,246
That heather dante,
where'd she get
that spike?

674
00:47:46,747 --> 00:47:49,249
Dad, don't you think
it's unfair what mom is doing?

675
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,752
Now making this
movie scene out of it.

676
00:47:51,752 --> 00:47:57,257
The sad mom who can't
come to her daughter's
sports events.

677
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,513
Dad.

678
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:08,101
Don't you think
it's totally out there?
My aspen trip.

679
00:48:08,101 --> 00:48:10,103
What is she thinking?

680
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:12,322
Dad?

681
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:21,281
It's been years
since i been here.

682
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:24,034
Dad, please talk to her.
Please.

683
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,037
This is so stupid.

684
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,039
Why are we sitting here?

685
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,543
Your mother thinks
you have the capacity
to be a top student,

686
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,545
and i agree.

687
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,548
What do you guys want,
perfection?

688
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,552
What are you looking at?

689
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:46,556
Your great- grandfather
and his brother frank,

690
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:49,059
they built this place.

691
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,061
Big whoop.

692
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:54,564
Stone and marble workers.
They came over from italy...

693
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:57,567
and they built this place.

694
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,071
Yeah, right. Two guys.

695
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:06,960
No, there were two guys
and a crew of laborers.

696
00:49:08,962 --> 00:49:11,465
They didn't design it...

697
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:15,085
but they knew
how to build it.

698
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:20,474
Go out now and find me two guys
who can put decent grout
around your bathtub.

699
00:49:57,377 --> 00:49:59,513
So i feel good.

700
00:49:59,513 --> 00:50:03,016
So i don't know if i'm
gonna be needing to come back.

701
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:05,018
It's not the prozac.

702
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,437
Why not?

703
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,423
You said you're
thinking clearer...

704
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,393
and your wife says
you seem to be better?

705
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:15,896
It's not the medication.

706
00:50:16,897 --> 00:50:18,899
Prozac takes
several weeks...

707
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:21,401
to build up effective levels
in the blood.

708
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,287
What is it, then?

709
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,791
Coming here. Talking.

710
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,795
Hope comes in many forms.

711
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,797
Well, who's got time
for that?

712
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,800
What is it you want
to say to me?

713
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:49,679
I had a dream last night.

714
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,683
Uh...

715
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:57,687
my bellybutton was...

716
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,690
a phillips head screw.

717
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,693
And i'm workin'
unscrewin' it,

718
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,695
and when i get it
unscrewed...

719
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:10,834
my penis falls off.

720
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:19,342
You know, i pick it up.
And i'm holdin' it
and i'm runnin' around...

721
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,344
lookin' for the guy who used to
work on my lincoln--

722
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:25,348
when i drove lincolns--
so he can put it back on.

723
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,851
And...

724
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,854
i'm holdin' it up,
and this bird swoops down...

725
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,857
and grabs it in its beak...

726
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,359
and flies off with it.

727
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:41,531
- What kind of bird? -

728
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,036
i don't know.
Seagull or something.

729
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,789
A water bird?

730
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:51,291
I sawthe birds
last week on cable.

731
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:54,294
You think
that planted the idea?
What else is a water bird?

732
00:51:55,295 --> 00:51:57,798
Pelican. Flamingo.

733
00:51:58,298 --> 00:52:00,550
What about ducks?

734
00:52:07,007 --> 00:52:09,509
Those goddamned ducks.

735
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:12,145
What is it about those ducks
that meant so much to you?

736
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:23,073
It was just a trip
havin' those...

737
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:26,076
wild creatures come...

738
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:29,579
into my pool and have
their little babies.

739
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:40,090
I was sad to see'em go.

740
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:44,594
Aw, jesus! Fuck!
Now he's gonna cry.

741
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,553
Shit. Fuck me.

742
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:55,555
When the ducks
gave birth...

743
00:52:56,056 --> 00:52:59,809
to those babies,
it became a family.

744
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,815
You're right.

745
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,952
That's the link.
The connection.

746
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:12,455
I'm afraid i'm gonna
lose my family...

747
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:15,458
like i lost the ducks.

748
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:19,045
That's what i'm full
of dread about.

749
00:53:22,048 --> 00:53:26,169
- That's always with me.
- What are you so afraid's
going to happen?

750
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:30,140
I don't know.

751
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:38,014
You work so hard.
You work so damn hard.

752
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:41,518
And to see
your life's dream...

753
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,521
burn down.

754
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:47,524
Look at it this way.
You collect the insurance.

755
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:49,409
Arthur, you gotta
say to yourself, it
could've been worse.

756
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,411
Yeah.
How could it
have been worse?

757
00:53:51,912 --> 00:53:54,915
Fuckin' faulty stove!

758
00:53:55,415 --> 00:53:57,918
Suppose people stop coming
to the restaurant?

759
00:53:59,286 --> 00:54:02,172
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck.

760
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:06,676
He's right about that.
There's no insurance for that.

761
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:09,179
But why would people
stop coming?

762
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:11,681
It's just starting
to catch on.

763
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,685
Know what i'm
figuring out lately?

764
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,687
Talking helps.

765
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:20,690
- That's right.
- He's right.

766
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:28,949
- Hope comes in many forms.
- Absolutely.

767
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,568
Come on.

768
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:34,070
Oh, geez.
Here, hold this.

769
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,073
Artie. Artie, come on.

770
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:39,075
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

771
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,077
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

772
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,581
I'll always help you.

773
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:48,084
Come on. Come on.

774
00:54:51,471 --> 00:54:55,342
Go cook. Let'im cook.
He'll feel better.

775
00:55:06,853 --> 00:55:09,856
Someday i'll tell him
we torched the restaurant...

776
00:55:09,856 --> 00:55:12,242
as the best solution.

777
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,614
Enough of this shit.

778
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:19,833
What's wrong with you?

779
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:23,336
You know, a simple
"way to go, chris"...

780
00:55:23,336 --> 00:55:28,091
on the triboro towers
contract would've been nice.

781
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:40,470
You're right.
You're right.

782
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:45,975
I have no defense.
That's howiwas parented,
never supported.

783
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:48,728
Never complimented.

784
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:51,731
You know, my cousin gregory's
girlfriend is what they call...

785
00:55:52,232 --> 00:55:54,234
a development girl
out in hollywood.

786
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,120
She said i could sell
my life story-- make millions.

787
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,489
I didn't do that.
I stuck it out with you--

788
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,624
come here. I could
fuckin' kill you.

789
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,127
What are you gonna do,
go henry hill on me?

790
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:07,630
You know how many mobsters
are selling screenplays,
screwing everything up?

791
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,632
She said i could maybe
even play myself.

792
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,135
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

793
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,640
Forget hollywood
screenplays.

794
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,642
Forget
those distractions.

795
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:23,146
What do you think,
i haven't had offers?

796
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:28,151
You got work to do.
New avenues.

797
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,653
Everything's
gonna be all right
from here on in.

798
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,156
Come on.

799
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,158
Look, it's
a beautiful day.

800
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,777
What could be bad?

801
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:43,783
It's nice of you to pick me up
for the party, junior.

802
00:56:43,783 --> 00:56:47,036
At least somebody
cares about me.

803
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:50,540
These kids today.
I suppose he thinks...

804
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:53,293
once he has me locked
in a nursing home,
i'll die faster.

805
00:56:53,793 --> 00:56:56,296
And then he won't
have to drive me anywhere.

806
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:00,683
If his father
were still alive,

807
00:57:00,934 --> 00:57:03,937
he'd show more decency
and respect for his mother.

808
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:07,440
My brother john
was a man among men.

809
00:57:07,941 --> 00:57:09,943
He was a saint.

810
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:13,813
Anyway, lots of things
are different now
from johnny's and my day.

811
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:15,815
What do you mean?

812
00:57:16,316 --> 00:57:19,819
I'm not free to run
my business like i want.
Isn't that awful.

813
00:57:19,953 --> 00:57:21,955
Just this week,
your son stuck his hand in.

814
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:24,457
Made it a hundred times
more difficult for me.

815
00:57:24,457 --> 00:57:28,461
- Plus, he thumbs his nose
at new york.
- Oh!

816
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:31,965
What are you going to do?
He's part of a whole generation.

817
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:33,967
Remember the crazy hair?

818
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:36,469
And the dope.
Now it's fags in the military.

819
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,722
Stop it, junior!
You're makin' me very upset!

820
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:42,225
I don't like to, livia,
but i'm allagita
all the time.

821
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,227
I'll tell you
something else,

822
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:47,096
things are down
across the board.

823
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:51,100
A lot of friends
of ours
are complaining.

824
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,603
We used to be recession- proof.
No more.

825
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:57,607
You can't blame it all
on the justice department.

826
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:00,610
Our friends say to me,

827
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:04,614
"junior, why don't you take
a larger hand in things?"

828
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:12,005
Something may have to be done,
livia, about tony.

829
00:58:13,006 --> 00:58:15,008
I don't know.

830
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,766
There they are.
Hey, ma! Uncle jun'!

831
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,768
You're using mesquite.

832
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:28,771
That makes
the sausage
taste peculiar.

833
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:31,774
Hi, grandma.
Happy birthday,
my big boy.

834
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,776
Carmela, my mother's here.

835
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:36,779
Everybody, let's eat!

836
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:54,297
Hey, meadow,
i'm not going to eat, are you?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
