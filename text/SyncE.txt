Synchronous Ethernet, also referred as SyncE, is an ITU-T standard for computer
networking that facilitates the transference of clock signals over Ethernet
physical layer.
This signal can then be made traceable to an external clock.

Unlike time division multiplexing networks, the Ethernet family of computer networks
do no carry clock synchonization information.

2.15 PP Synchronous Ethernet

The device allows frequency synchronous:
    - a clock signal can be recovered from any of the ports, and at any port speeds.
    - multiple redundant recovered clock outputs, allowing fast failover when a master fails.
    - Synchronization Status Messages (SSM) can be trapped to the CPU without using
      the PCL/TTI TCAM.

------
SyncE allows various nodes in an Ethernet network to synch to the same clock freq.
This functionality is useful in systems where TDM services, such as SONET or SDH
are transported over an Ethernet network.

The clock distribution in SyncE network is performed in a tree based topology,
where the root of the tree is a master, that is either driven by a precise clock,
or connected to a synchronous TDM network. In each switching device, the clock
frequency is recovered from the incoming data to the slave port, and is used as
the transmission clock of the other ports, allowing the clock frequency to be
distributed to subsequent devices.

47.1 Clock Data Recovery
47.1.1 Clock Recovery Scheme
----------------------------
From incoming data from a designated port called the reference port.
The reference port can be a network port connected to a PHY, or a port that
is connected to another device without a PHY.
The clock signal that is recovered from the reference port is used an input to
an external sychronizer component that generates a clean recovered clock.
The clock synchronizer is essentially a PLL that is used for cleaning jitters
on the clock signals, and for frequency conversion if such is necessary.
The recovered clock from the synchronizer is used as the transmission clock in
the PHY devices, as well as in the SERDES of the switching device, allowing
transmission of data at an accurate frequency.

The clock synchronizer typically drives the SERDES clock inputs: CMN<n>_REF_CLK:
    - REF_CLK_25
    - PTP_REF_CLK

47.1.2 Recovered Clock Outputs
------------------------------
The device provides multiple recovered clock outputs.
The device supports clock recovery from any of its ports.

Configuration
=============
    - Configure the first SERDES by clearing <SD Recovered Clock 0 Select> field
        in the SERDES External Configuration 1 Register in one of the SERDES in the
        port group, and setting this bit in the other SERDES.
    -                                        <SD Recovered Clock 1 Select>
    - To select whether the PTP_PCLK_OUT interface is used as a PClk output
        or a recovered clock input, use <pclk_or_rcvr_clk_sel>
    - In the reference SERDES, to configure the output clock automatic masking:
        <Recovered Clock 0 Automatic Masking Enable>
        <                1                         >

47.1.3 Recovered Clock Frequency
--------------------------------
The frequency of the recovered clock output depends on the port speed of the
reference port.
The clock signal at the recovered clock output can be configured to be divided
by a constant factor = 1,2,3,4,5,8,16,2.5,16.5

Configuration
=============
        <Recovered Clock 0 Division Mode>
        <                1              >

47.1.4 SERDES Clock Inputs
--------------------------
Use 2 clock inputs:
    - a clock synchronizer, which is a PLL connected to the RCVR_CLK_OUT pins;
    - an oscillator, which drives the CMN_REF_CLK inputs.

Additional oscillator is used for the reference port, while the clock synchronizer
is used for the rest of the ports.


47.2 Synchronization Status Messaging
-------------------------------------
SyncE uses SSM (Synchronization Status Messages) to signal the stratum level of a clock,
to notify about clock failures, etc.
SSM messages are OAM PDU messages- can be identified and trapped to the CPU in one
of the following ways:
    - w/o TCAM (OAM control plane).
    - alternatively, an SSM packet can be identified by the Ingress Policy engine,
      using the following fields:
            - Mct MAC DA - OAM PDUs = 01-80-C2-00-00-C2
            - slow protocol Ethertype = 0x8809
            - OAM PDU subtype (0x03) and Code (0xFE)



Ethernet Synchronization Message Channel (ESMC) is a logical communication channel.
It transmit Synchronization Status Message (SSM) information, which is the quality
level of the transmitting synchronous Ethernet equipment clock (EEC), by using
ESMC protocl data unit (PDUs).
ESMC support is based on the ITU G.8264 specification.

The clock selection process supports revertive and nonrevertive mode.
When the clock selection process has selected two clock sources - a primary and
a secondary - and the active primary clock source degrades over a period of time
and then improves again, this primary source again becomes the active clock sources
only if revertive mode is enabled.

27. Synchronous Ethernet = SynchE
---------------------------------
SynchE allows various nodes in an Ethernet network to synchronize to the same
clock frequency.

In each switching device the clock frequency is recovered from the incoming
data to the slave port, and is used as the transmission clock of the other ports,
allowing the clock frequency to be distributed to consequent devices.

27.1 Clock Data Recovery
------------------------
A SynchE recovers the clock signal from the incoming data from a designated port
called the reference port.
The reference port can be:
    - a network port connected to a PHY ===> clock recovered by the PHY device
    - a port that is connected to another device without a PHY, e.g., throug a backplane
      interface. ===> recovered by the switching device.

The clock signal recovered from the reference port is used as an input to
an external synchronizer component that generates a clean recovered clock.
The clock synchronizer is essentially a PLL (phased - locked loop) that is used
for cleaning jitters on the clock signals, and for frequency conversion,
if necessary. The recovered clock from the synchronizer is used as the transmission
clock in the PHY devices, as well as in the SERDES of the switching device,
allowing transmitting data at an accurate frequency.

Recovered Clock Output
----------------------
The device supports clock recovery from any the SERDES, allowing them to be used
as reference ports:
    - A SERDES from each portGroup (i.e., up to four reference SERDES).

To set the reference clock, call RecoveryClkConfigSet:
    - reference clock;
    - port number;
    - lane (application responsibles that port number and lane number are compatible).

!!! There is an option to set the signal of the reference clock to zero in the
output ping of the device if the link is down. To set this, call RecoveryClkAutomaticMaskingEnableSet.

Recovered clock division
------------------------
The clock signal at the recovered clock reference output uses one of the following
frequencies:
    - clock frequency of the SERDES of the reference port;
    - clock frequency of the SERDES of the reference port, divided by a factor.
       125MHz /5 = 25 MHz!!!

SERDES clock inputs:
--------------------
Each port in the system can be driven by one of two clock sources:
    - external clock synchronizer;
    - local clock source.
By PllRefClkSelectSet()
