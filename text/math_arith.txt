I.  Introduction and review
===========================
Part 1.  Introduction
---------------------
1. Historical Introduction
--------------------------
Counting by the aid of ten fingers.

2. Signs of operation used in arithmetic
----------------------------------------
   +    plus
   -    minus
   x    multiplication
   /    division

   =    equality sign
   ()   parentheses

3. Writing very large and very small numbers
--------------------------------------------
    1,000,000,000  = 10^9
    38,970,000,000 = 3.897 x 10^10

    0.0000007      = 0.7 x 10^-6

Chapter 2   The fundamental operations
--------------------------------------
6. Addition
-----------
Addition is the process of finding the combined amount of two or more numbers.

7. Subtraction
--------------
Subtraction is the process of finding the difference between two numbers by
taking the smaller of the two from the larger.
The number which is subtracted is called the subtrahend, the other number is
called the minuend, and their difference, the number which remains after the
subtrahend is subtracted from the minuend, is called remainder.

8.  Multiplication
-----------------
9.  Division

Chapter 3   Calculation with decimals
-------------------------------------
10. Decimal Numbers
-------------------
A fraction is a part of quantity which is treated as a whole or a unit.
Fraction is a number which represents a part, that is, a number which is less
than 1.
In writing a common fraction, two numbers are used, called the numerator and
denominator. The denominator names the fractional part and the numerator
indicates how many of those parts are used.
    seven ninths = 7/9
If the denominators are tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc., the
numerators may be written without the denominators and with a period placed
before the numerators.
    0.7 = 7/10
    .23 = 23/100

Chapter 4   Approximate results in calculation
----------------------------------------------
14. Approximate results
-----------------------
If a rejected figure in a decimal fraction is less than 5 it is disregarded; if
it is 5 or greater the next figure to the left of it, it retained, is increased
by 1 unit.

II. Principles and methods of arithmetic
========================================
Chapter 5.  Factors, multiples and divisors.
20. Definitions.
----------------
If a certain number is the product of two or more other numbers, each of those
other numbers is called a factor of that number.
    6 = 2 x 3, 2 is factor of 6
Multiple of any number is the product obtained by multiplying that number by
some other number.
    42 = 6 x 7,  42 is a multiple of 6.

Common multiple of several numbers is a number which is a multiple of each of
those numbers.  81 is multiple 3,9,27
Least common multiple (LCM) is the smaller number which is a multiple of each of
them.
Greatest common divisor is the largest number which is an exact divisor of each
of them. GCD

A number which has other factors besides itself and 1 is called a composite
number. One which has no other factors except itself and 1 is called a prime
number.

A number which has 2 as a factor, that is, is exactly divisible by 2, is called
an even number. Other numbers, not divisible by 2, are odd numbers.

If the number represented by the last three figures of a given number is
divisible by 8, the given number is divisible by 8.

If the sum of the even placed figures of a number equals that of the odd placed
figures, or if the difference of the two sums is divisible by 11, the number
is divisible by 11.
 121 =  2 = (1+1)   2-2 = 0
 143 = 
 561

Chapter 6 Fraction
------------------
1/4     = one fourth
1/10    = one tenth

If a single unit be divided into equal parts each of the parts is called
a fractional unit.
A fraction is one or the sum of several fractional units.
Numerator = number of units  and Denominator = fractional unit
if N < D then it is a proper fraction otherwise improper fraction.
A number which is expressed by a whole number and a fraction is called a
mixed number.

n/d = nm/dm

Chapter 7   Powers and roots
----------------------------
base^exponent = 5^2 = 5 to the second (power)

5 is root of 25

Chapter 8   Logarithms
