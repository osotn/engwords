An executable computer program is, ultimately, just a series of numbers that have very little or no meaning to a human being - stream of numbers - that is called the instruction stream.

A simplified model of a computer system consists of:
	- memory
	- input/output devices
	- CPU
That connected together by a system bus.

Modern computers execute instructions sequentially.
The next instruction to be executed is at the memory address immediately following the current instruction.

One of the registers in CPU - PC = program counter.
