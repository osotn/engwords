1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth
was a vast waste, darkness covered the deep, and the spirit of God hovered over
the surface of the water. 3 God said, ‘ Let there be light,’ and there was
light; 4 and God saw the light was good, and he separated light from darkness.
5 He called the light day, and the darkness night. So evening came, and morning
came; it was the first day.
1:6 God said, ‘ Let there be a vault between the waters, to separate water
from water.’ 7 So God made the vault, and separated the water under the vault
from the water above it, and so it was; 8 and God called the vault the heavens.
Evening came, and morning came, the second day.
1:9 God said, ‘ Let the water under the heavens be gathered into one
place, so that dry land may appear’; and so it was. 10 God called the dry land
earth, and the gathering of the water he called sea; and God saw that it was
good. 11 Then God said, ‘ Let the earth produce growing things; let there be on
the earth plants that bear seed, and trees bearing fruit each with its own kind
of seed.’ So it was; 12 the earth produced growing things: plants bearing their
own kind of seed and trees bearing fruit, each with its own kind of seed; and
God saw that it was good. 13 Evening came, and morning came, the third day.
1:14 God said, ‘ Let there be lights in the vault of the heavens to
separate day from night, and let them serve as signs both for festivals and for
seasons and years. 15 Let them also shine in the heavens to give light on
earth.’ So it was; 16 God made two great lights, the greater to govern the day
and the lesser to govern the night; he also made the stars. 17 God put these
lights in the vault of the heavens to give light on earth, 18 to govern day and
night, and to separate light from darkness; and God saw that it was good. 19
Evening came, and morning came, the fourth day.
1:20 God said, ‘ Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds
fly above the earth across the vault of the heavens.’ 21 God then created the
great sea-beasts and all living creatures that move and swarm in the water,
according to their various kinds, and every kind of bird; and God saw that it
was good. 22 He blessed them and said, ‘ Be fruitful and increase; fill the
water of the sea, and let the birds increase on the land.’ 23 Evening came, and
morning came, the fifth day.
1:24 God said, ‘ Let the earth bring forth living creatures, according to
their various kinds: cattle, creeping things, and wild animals, all according to
their various kinds.’ So it was; 25 God made wild animals, cattle, and every
creeping thing, all according to their various kinds; and he saw that it was
good. 26 Then God said, ‘ Let us make human beings in our image, after our
likeness, to have dominion over the fish in the sea, the birds of the air, the
cattle, all wild animals on land, and everything that creeps on the earth.’ 27
God created human beings in his own image; in the image of God he created them;
male and female he created them. 28 God blessed them and said to them, ‘ Be
fruitful and increase, fill the earth and subdue it, have dominion over the fish
in the sea, the birds of the air, and every living thing that moves on the
earth.’ 29 God also said, ‘ Throughout the earth I give you all plants that bear
seed, and every tree that bears fruit with seed: they shall be yours for food.
30 All green plants I give for food to the wild animals, to all the birds of the
air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, every living creature.’ So it
was; 31 and God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. Evening came,
and morning came, the sixth day.

2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth and everything in them were completed.
2 On the sixth day God brought to an end all the work he had been doing; on the

seventh day, having finished all his work, 3 God blessed the day and made it
holy, because it was the day he finished all his work of creation. 4 This is
the story of the heavens and the earth after their creation.
 When the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, 5 there was neither shrub
nor plant growing on the earth, because the Lord God had sent no rain; nor was
there anyone to till the ground. 6 Moisture used to well up out of the earth
and water all the surface of the ground. 


 2:7 The Lord God formed a human being from the dust of the ground and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, so that he became a living
creature. 8 The Lord God planted a garden in Eden away to the east, and in it
he put the man he had formed. 9 The Lord God made trees grow up from the
ground, every kind of tree pleasing to the eye and good for food; and in the
middle of the garden he set the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil. 

2:10 There was a river flowing from Eden to water the garden, and from
there it branched into four streams. 11 The name of the first is Pishon; it is
the river which skirts the whole land of Havilah, where gold is found. 12 The
gold of that land is good; gum resin and cornelians are also to be found there.
13 The name of the second river is Gihon; this is the one which skirts the whole
land of Cush. 14 The name of the third is Tigris; this is the river which flows
east of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.


2:15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till
it and look after it. 16 ‘ You may eat from any tree in the garden ’, he told the
man, 17 ‘ except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; the day you
eat from that, you are surely doomed to die.’ 18 Then the Lord God said, ‘ It is
not good for the man to be alone; I shall make a partner suited to him.’ 19 So
from the earth he formed all the wild animals and all the birds of the air, and
brought them to the man to see what he would call them; whatever the man called
each living creature, that would be its name. 20 The man gave names to all
cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every wild animal; but for the man
himself no suitable partner was found. 21 The Lord God then put the man into a
deep sleep and, while he slept, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the
flesh over the place. 22 The rib he had taken out of the man the Lord God built
up into a woman, and he brought her to the man. 23 The man said: ‘ This one at
last is bone from my bones, flesh from my flesh! She shall be called woman, for
from man was she taken.’ 24 That is why a man leaves his father and mother and
attaches himself to his wife, and the two become one. 25 Both were naked, the
man and his wife, but they had no feeling of shame.

 3:1 The serpent, which was the most cunning of all the creatures the Lord
God had made, asked the woman, ‘ Is it true that God has forbidden you to eat
from any tree in the garden?’ 2 She replied, ‘ We may eat the fruit of any tree
in the garden, 3 except for the tree in the middle of the garden. God has
forbidden us to eat the fruit of that tree or even to touch it; if we do, we
shall die.’ 4 ‘ Of course you will not die,’ said the serpent; 5 ‘ for God knows
that, as soon as you eat it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God
himself, knowing both good and evil.’ 6 The woman looked at the tree: the fruit
would be good to eat; it was pleasing to the eye and desirable for the knowledge
it could give. So she took some and ate it; she also gave some to her husband,
and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that
they were naked; so they stitched fig-leaves together and made themselves
loincloths. 

The man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God walking about in
the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and they hid from him among the
trees. 9 The Lord God called to the man, ‘ Where are you?’ 10 He replied, ‘ I
heard the sound of you in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked, so I
hid.’ 11 God said, ‘ Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the
tree which I forbade you to eat from?’ 12 The man replied, ‘ It was the woman
you gave to be with me who gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.’ 13 The


Lord God said to the woman, ‘ What have you done?’ The woman answered, ‘ It was
the serpent who deceived me into eating it.’ 14 Then the Lord God said to the
serpent:
 ‘ Because you have done this you are cursed alone of all cattle and the
creatures of the wild. ‘ On your belly you will crawl, and dust you will eat all
the days of your life. 15 I shall put enmity between you and the woman, between
your brood and hers. They will strike at your head, and you will strike at their
heel.’ 16 To the woman he said: ‘ I shall give you great labour in childbearing;
with labour you will bear children. You will desire your husband, but he will be
your master.’ 17 And to the man he said: ‘ Because you have listened to your
wife and have eaten from the tree which I forbade you, on your account the earth
will be cursed. You will get your food from it only by labour all the days of
your life; 18 it will yield thorns and thistles for you. You will eat of the
produce of the field, 19 and only by the sweat of your brow will you win your
bread until you return to the earth; for from it you were taken. Dust you are,
to dust you will return.’ 20 The man named his wife Eve because she was the
mother of all living beings. 21 The Lord God made coverings from skins for the
man and his wife and clothed them. 22 But he said, ‘ The man has become like one
of us, knowing good and evil; what if he now reaches out and takes fruit from
the tree of life also, and eats it and lives for ever?’ 23 So the Lord God
banished him from the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he had been
taken. 24 When he drove him out, God settled him to the east of the garden of
Eden, and he stationed the cherubim and a sword whirling and flashing to guard
the way to the tree of life. 


4:1 The man lay with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to
Cain. She said, ‘ With the help of the Lord I have brought into being a male
child.’ 2 Afterwards she had another child, Abel. He tended the flock, and Cain
worked the land. 3 In due season Cain brought some of the fruits of the earth
as an offering to the Lord, 4 while Abel brought the choicest of the firstborn
of his flock. The Lord regarded Abel and his offering with favour, 5 but not
Cain and his offering. Cain was furious and he glowered. 6 The Lord said to
Cain, ‘ Why are you angry? Why are you scowling? 7 If you do well, you hold your
head up; if not, sin is a demon crouching at the door; it will desire you, and
you will be mastered by it.’ 8 Cain said to his brother Abel, ‘ Let us go out
into the country.’ Once there, Cain attacked and murdered his brother. 9 The
Lord asked Cain, ‘ Where is your brother Abel?’ ‘ I do not know,’ Cain answered.
‘ Am I my brother’s keeper?’ 10 The Lord said, ‘ What have you done? Your
brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground. 11 Now you are accursed
and will be banished from the very ground which has opened its mouth to receive
the blood you have shed. 12 When you till the ground, it will no longer yield
you its produce. You shall be a wanderer, a fugitive on the earth.’ 13 Cain
said to the Lord, ‘ My punishment is heavier than I can bear; 14 now you are
driving me off the land, and I must hide myself from your presence. I shall be a
wanderer, a fugitive on the earth, and I can be killed at sight by anyone.’ 15
The Lord answered him, ‘ No: if anyone kills Cain, sevenfold vengeance will be
exacted from him.’ The Lord put a mark on Cain, so that anyone happening to meet
him should not kill him. 16 Cain went out from the Lord's presence and settled
in the land of Nod to the east of Eden. 

4:17 Then Cain lay with his wife; and she conceived and gave birth to
Enoch. Cain was then building a town which he named Enoch after his son. 18
Enoch was the father of Irad, Irad of Mehujael, Mehujael of Methushael, and
Methushael of Lamech.

4:19 Lamech married two women, one named Adah, the other Zillah. 20 Adah
gave birth to Jabal, the ancestor of tent-dwellers who raise flocks and herds.
21 His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of those who play the harp
and pipe. 22 Zillah, the other wife, bore Tubal-cain, the master of all
coppersmiths and blacksmiths, and Tubal-cain’s sister was Naamah. 23 Lamech
said to his wives: ‘ Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, mark what I
say: I kill a man for wounding me, a young man for a blow. 24 If sevenfold
vengeance was to be exacted for Cain, for Lamech it would be seventy-sevenfold.’


25 Adam lay with his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth,
‘ for ’, she said, ‘ God has granted me another son in place of Abel, because Cain
killed him ’. 26 Seth too had a son, whom he named Enosh. At that time people
began to invoke the Lord by name. 

This is the list of Adam's descendants. On the day when God created
human beings he made them in his own likeness. 2 He created them male and
female, and on the day when he created them, he blessed them and called them
man.

 5:3 Adam was one hundred and thirty years old when he begot a son in his
likeness and image, and named him Seth. 4 After the birth of Seth he lived
eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters. 5 He lived nine hundred
and thirty years, and then he died.

 5:6 Seth was one hundred and five years old when he begot Enosh. 7 After
the birth of Enosh he lived eight hundred and seven years, and had other sons
and daughters. 8 He lived nine hundred and twelve years, and then he died. 


5:9 Enosh was ninety years old when he begot Kenan. 10 After the birth
of Kenan he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and had other sons and
daughters. 11 He lived nine hundred and five years, and then he died.

5:12 Kenan was seventy years old when he begot Mahalalel. 13 After the
birth of Mahalalel he lived eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons
and daughters. 14 He lived nine hundred and ten years, and then he died. 

5:15 Mahalalel was sixty-five years old when he begot Jared. 16 After
the birth of Jared he lived eight hundred and thirty years, and had other sons
and daughters. 17 He lived eight hundred and ninety-five years, and then he
died. 

5:18 Jared was one hundred and sixty-two years old when he begot Enoch.
19 After the birth of Enoch he lived eight hundred years, and had other sons and
daughters. 20 He lived nine hundred and sixty-two years, and then he died. 

5:21 Enoch was sixty-five years old when he begot Methuselah. 22 After
the birth of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God for three hundred years, and had
other sons and daughters. 23 He lived three hundred and sixty-five years. 24
Enoch walked with God, and then was seen no more, because God had taken him
away. 

Methuselah was one hundred and eighty-seven years old when he begot
Lamech. 26 After the birth of Lamech he lived for seven hundred and eighty-two
years, and had other sons and daughters. 27 He lived nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and then he died.

5:28 Lamech was one hundred and eighty-two years old when he begot a son.
29 He named him Noah, saying, ‘ This boy will bring us relief from our work, from
the labour that has come upon us because of the Lord’s curse on the ground.’ 30
After the birth of Noah he lived for five hundred and ninety-five years, and had
other sons and daughters. 31 Lamech lived seven hundred and seventy-seven
years, and then he died. 32 Noah was five hundred years old when he begot Shem,
Ham, and Japheth. 

6:1 The human race began to increase and to spread over the earth and
daughters were born to them. 2 The sons of the gods saw how beautiful these
daughters were, so they took for themselves such women as they chose. 3 But the
Lord said, ‘ My spirit will not remain in a human being for ever; because he is
mortal flesh, he will live only for a hundred and twenty years.’

 6:4 In those days as well as later, when the sons of the gods had
intercourse with the daughters of mortals and children were born to them, the
Nephilim were on the earth; they were the heroes of old, people of renown.

6:5 When the Lord saw how great was the wickedness of human beings on
earth, and how their every thought and inclination were always wicked, 6 he
bitterly regretted that he had made mankind on earth. 7 He said, ‘ I shall wipe
off the face of the earth this human race which I have created — yes, man and
beast, creeping things and birds. I regret that I ever made them.’ 8 Noah,
however, had won the Lord’s favour.

6:9 This is the story of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, the one
blameless man of his time, and he walked with God. 10 He had three sons: Shem,
Ham, and Japheth. 11 God saw that the world was corrupt and full of violence;
12 and seeing this corruption, for the life of everyone on earth was corrupt,
13 God said to Noah, ‘ I am going to bring the whole human race to an end, for
because of them the earth is full of violence. I am about to destroy them, and
the earth along with them. 14 Make yourself an ark with ribs of cypress; cover
it with reeds and coat it inside and out with pitch. 15 This is to be its
design: the length of the ark is to be three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty
cubits, and its height thirty cubits. 16 You are to make a roof for the ark,
giving it a fall of one cubit when complete; put a door in the side of the ark,
and build three decks, lower, middle, and upper. 17 I am about to bring the
waters of the flood over the earth to destroy from under heaven every human
being that has the spirit of life; everything on earth shall perish. 18 But
with you I shall make my covenant, and you will go into the ark, you with your
sons, your wife, and your sons' wives. 19 You are to bring living creatures of
every kind into the ark to keep them alive with you, two of each kind, a male
and a female; 20 two of every kind of bird, beast, and creeping thing are to
come to you to be kept alive. 21 See that you take and store by you every kind
of food that can be eaten; this will be food for you and for them.’ 22 Noah
carried out exactly all God had commanded him. 

7:1 The Lord said to Noah, ‘ Go into the ark, you and all your household;
for you alone in this generation have I found to be righteous. 2 Take with you
seven pairs, a male and female, of all beasts that are ritually clean, and one
pair, a male and female, of all beasts that are not clean; 3 also seven pairs,
males and females, of every bird — to ensure that life continues on earth. 4 For
in seven days’ time I am going to send rain on the earth for forty days and
forty nights, and I shall wipe off the face of the earth every living creature I
have made.’ 5 Noah did all that the Lord had commanded him. 6 He was six
hundred years old when the water of the flood came on the earth

7:7 So to escape the flood Noah went into the ark together with his sons,
his wife, and his sons' wives. 8 [-9] And to him on board the ark went one
pair, a male and a female, of all beasts, clean and unclean, of birds, and of
everything that creeps on the ground, two by two, as God had commanded. 10 At
the end of seven days the water of the flood came over the earth. 11 In the
year when Noah was six hundred years old, on the seventeenth day of the second
month, that very day all the springs of the great deep burst out, the windows of
the heavens were opened, 12 and rain fell on the earth for forty days and forty
nights. 13 That was the day Noah went into the ark with his sons, Shem, Ham,
and Japheth, his own wife, and his three sons' wives. 14 Wild animals of every
kind, cattle of every kind, every kind of thing that creeps on the ground, and
winged birds of every kind — 15 all living creatures came two by two to Noah in
the ark. 16 Those which came were one male and one female of all living things;
they came in as God had commanded Noah, and the Lord closed the door on him. 


7:17 The flood continued on the earth for forty days, and the swelling
waters lifted up the ark so that it rose high above the ground. 18 The ark
floated on the surface of the swollen waters as they increased over the earth.
19 They increased more and more until they covered all the high mountains
everywhere under heaven. 20 The water increased until the mountains were
covered to a depth of fifteen cubits. 21 Every living thing that moved on earth
perished: birds, cattle, wild animals, all creatures that swarm on the ground,
and all human beings. 22 Everything on dry land died, everything that had the
breath of life in its nostrils. 23 God wiped out every living creature that
existed on earth, man and beast, creeping thing and bird; they were all wiped
out over the whole earth, and only Noah and those who were with him in the ark
survived. 

7:24 When the water had increased over the earth for a hundred and fifty
days, 

8:1 God took thought for Noah and all the beasts and cattle with him in
the ark, and he caused a wind to blow over the earth, so that the water began to
subside. 2 The springs of the deep and the windows of the heavens were stopped
up, the downpour from the skies was checked. 3 Gradually the water receded from
the earth, and by the end of a hundred and fifty days it had abated. 4 On the
seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark grounded on the mountains of
Ararat. 5 The water continued to abate until the tenth month, and on the first
day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains could be seen. 

8:6 At the end of forty days Noah opened the hatch that he had made in
the ark, 7 and sent out a raven; it continued flying to and fro until the water
on the earth had dried up. 8 Then Noah sent out a dove to see whether the water
on the earth had subsided. 9 But the dove found no place where she could settle
because all the earth was under water, and so she came back to him in the ark.
Noah reached out and caught her, and brought her into the ark. 10 He waited
seven days more and again sent out the dove from the ark. 11 She came back to
him towards evening with a freshly plucked olive leaf in her beak. Noah knew
then that the water had subsided from the earth’s surface. 12 He waited yet
another seven days and, when he sent out the dove, she did not come back to him.
13 So it came about that, on the first day of the first month of his six hundred
and first year, the water had dried up on the earth, and when Noah removed the
hatch and looked out, he saw that the ground was dry.

 8:14 By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was dry, 15
and God spoke to Noah. 16 ‘ Come out of the ark together with your wife, your
sons, and their wives,’ he said. 17 ‘ Bring out every living creature that is
with you, live things of every kind, birds, beasts, and creeping things, and let
them spread over the earth and be fruitful and increase on it.’ 18 So Noah came
out with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, 19 and all the animals,
creeping things, and birds; everything that moves on the ground came out of the
ark, one kind after another.


8:20 Noah built an altar to the Lord and, taking beasts and birds of
every kind that were ritually clean, he offered them as whole-offerings on it.
21 When the Lord smelt the soothing odour, he said within himself, ‘ Never again
shall I put the earth under a curse because of mankind, however evil their
inclination may be from their youth upwards, nor shall I ever again kill all
living creatures, as I have just done. 22 ‘ As long as the earth lasts, seedtime
and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, they will never
cease.’


 9:1 God blessed Noah and his sons; he said to them, ‘ Be fruitful and
increase in numbers, and fill the earth. 2 Fear and dread of you will come on
all the animals on earth, on all the birds of the air, on everything that moves
on the ground, and on all fish in the sea; they are made subject to you. 3
Every creature that lives and moves will be food for you; I give them all to
you, as I have given you every green plant. 4 But you must never eat flesh with
its life still in it, that is the blood. 5 And further, for your life-blood I
shall demand satisfaction; from every animal I shall require it, and from human
beings also I shall require satisfaction for the death of their fellows. 6
‘ Anyone who sheds human blood, for that human being his blood will be shed;
because in the image of God has God made human beings. 7 ‘ Be fruitful, then,
and increase in number; people the earth and rule over it.’ 

9:8 God said to Noah and his sons: 9 ‘ I am now establishing my covenant
with you and with your descendants after you, 10 and with every living creature
that is with you, all birds and cattle, all the animals with you on earth, all
that have come out of the ark. 11 I shall sustain my covenant with you: never
again will all living creatures be destroyed by the waters of a flood, never
again will there be a flood to lay waste the earth.’ 

 9:12 God said, ‘ For all generations to come, this is the sign which I am
giving of the covenant between myself and you and all living creatures with you:
13 My bow I set in the clouds to be a sign of the covenant between myself and
the earth. 14 When I bring clouds over the earth, the rainbow will appear in
the clouds. 15 ‘ Then I shall remember the covenant which I have made with you
and with all living creatures, and never again will the waters become a flood to
destroy all creation. 16 Whenever the bow appears in the cloud, I shall see it
and remember the everlasting covenant between God and living creatures of every
kind on earth.’ 17 So God said to Noah, ‘ This is the sign of the covenant which
I have established with all that lives on earth.’ 

9:18 The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and
Japheth; Ham was the father of Canaan. 19 These three were the sons of Noah,
and their descendants spread over the whole earth.

 9:20 Noah, who was the first tiller of the soil, planted a vineyard. 21
He drank so much of the wine that he became drunk and lay naked inside his tent.
22 Ham, father of Canaan, saw his father naked, and went out and told his two
brothers. 23 Shem and Japheth took a cloak, put it on their shoulders, and,
walking backwards, covered their father's naked body. They kept their faces
averted, so that they did not see his nakedness. 24 When Noah woke from his
drunkenness and learnt what his youngest son had done to him, 25 he said:
‘ Cursed be Canaan! Most servile of slaves shall he be to his brothers.’ 26 And
he went on: ‘ Bless, O Lord, the tents of Shem; may Canaan be his slave. 27 May
God extend Japheth’s boundaries, let him dwell in the tents of Shem, may Canaan
be his slave.’ 28 After the flood Noah lived for three hundred and fifty years;
29 he was nine hundred and fifty years old when he died. 

10:1 These are the descendants of Noah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth,
the sons born to them after the flood.

10:2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and
Tiras. 3 The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 4 The sons of
Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim. 5 From these the peoples of the
coasts and islands separated into their own countries, each with their own
language, family by family, nation by nation. 

10:6 The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 7 The sons of
Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtecha. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and
Dedan. 8 Cush was the father of Nimrod, who began to be known on earth for his
might. 9 He was outstanding as a mighty hunter — as the saying goes, ‘ like
Nimrod, outstanding as a mighty hunter’. 10 At first his kingdom consisted of
Babel, Erech, and Accad, all of them in the land of Shinar. 11 From that land
he migrated to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah, 12 and Resen, a
great city between Nineveh and Calah. 13 From Mizraim sprang the Ludim,
Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites, 14 Pathrusites, Casluhites, and the
Caphtorites, from whom the Philistines were descended.

10:15 Canaan was the father of Sidon, who was his eldest son, and Heth,
16 the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 17 the Hivites, the Arkites,
the Sinites, 18 the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Later the
Canaanites spread, 19 and then the Canaanite border ran from Sidon towards
Gerar all the way to Gaza; then all the way to Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and
Zeboyim as far as Lasha. 20 These were the sons of Ham, by families and
languages, with their countries and nations. 

10:21 Sons were born also to Shem, elder brother of Japheth, the ancestor
of all the sons of Eber. 22 The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and
Aram. 23 The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 24 Arphaxad was the
father of Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber. 25 Eber had two sons: one was
named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; and his brother's name
was Joktan. 26 Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmoth, Jerah, 27
Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab.
All these were sons of Joktan. 30 They lived in the eastern hill-country, from
Mesha all the way to Sephar. 31 These were the sons of Shem, by families and
languages, with their countries and nations. 

10:32 These were the families of the sons of Noah according to their
genealogies, nation by nation; and from them came the separate nations on earth
after the flood. 

11:1 There was a time when all the world spoke a single language and used
the same words. 2 As people journeyed in the east, they came upon a plain in
the land of Shinar and settled there. 3 They said to one another, ‘ Come, let us
make bricks and bake them hard’; they used bricks for stone and bitumen for
mortar. 4 Then they said, ‘ Let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its
top in the heavens and make a name for ourselves, or we shall be dispersed over
the face of the earth.’ 5 The Lord came down to see the city and tower which
they had built, 6 and he said, ‘ Here they are, one people with a single
language, and now they have started to do this; from now on nothing they have a
mind to do will be beyond their reach. 7 Come, let us go down there and confuse
their language, so that they will not understand what they say to one another.’
8 So the Lord dispersed them from there all over the earth, and they left off
building the city. 9 That is why it is called Babel, because there the Lord
made a babble of the language of the whole world. It was from that place the
Lord scattered people over the face of the earth. 

 11:10 These are the descendants of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old
when he begot Arphaxad, two years after the flood. 11 After the birth of
Arphaxad he lived five hundred years, and had other sons and daughters. 12
Arphaxad was thirty-five years old when he begot Shelah. 13 After the birth of
Shelah he lived four hundred and three years, and had other sons and daughters. 

11:14 Shelah was thirty years old when he begot Eber. 15 After the birth
of Eber he lived four hundred and three years, and had other sons and daughters.

11:16 Eber was thirty-four years old when he begot Peleg. 17 After the
birth of Peleg he lived four hundred and thirty years, and had other sons and
daughters. 

s thirty years old when he begot Reu. 19 After the birth
of Reu he lived two hundred and nine years, and had other sons and daughters. 

11:20 Reu was thirty-two years old when he begot Serug. 21 After the
birth of Serug he lived two hundred and seven years, and had other sons and
daughters. 

11:22 Serug was thirty years old when he begot Nahor. 23 After the birth
of Nahor he lived two hundred years, and had other sons and daughters. 

11:24 Nahor was twenty-nine years old when he begot Terah. 25 After the
birth of Terah he lived a hundred and nineteen years, and had other sons and
daughters. 

11:26 Terah was seventy years old when he begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

11:27 These are the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram,
Nahor, and Haran. Haran was Lot's father. 28 Haran died in the land of his
birth, Ur of the Chaldees, during his father's lifetime. 29 Abram and Nahor
married wives; Abram’s wife was called Sarai, and Nahor’s Milcah. She was the
daughter of Haran, father of Milcah and Iscah. 30 Sarai was barren; she had no
child. 31 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot the son of Haran, and his
daughter-in-law Sarai, Abram's wife, and they set out from Ur of the Chaldees
for Canaan. But when they reached Harran, they settled there. 32 Terah was two 
hundred and five years old when he died in Harran. 


12:1 The Lord said to Abram, ‘ Leave your own country, your kin, and your
father’s house, and go to a country that I will show you. 2 I shall make you
into a great nation; I shall bless you and make your name so great that it will
be used in blessings: 3 those who bless you, I shall bless; those who curse
you, I shall curse. All the peoples on earth will wish to be blessed as you are
blessed.’ 4 Abram, who was seventy-five years old when he left Harran, set out
as the Lord had bidden him, and Lot went with him. 5 He took his wife Sarai,
his brother’s son Lot, and all the possessions they had gathered and the
dependants they had acquired in Harran, and they departed for Canaan. When they
arrived there, 6 Abram went on as far as the sanctuary at Shechem, the
terebinth tree of Moreh. (At that time the Canaanites lived in the land.) 7
When the Lord appeared to him and said, ‘ I am giving this land to your
descendants,’ Abram built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him. 8
From there he moved on to the hill-country east of Bethel and pitched his tent
between Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. He built there an altar to the
Lord whom he invoked by name. 9 Thus Abram journeyed by stages towards the
Negeb. 

12:10 The land was stricken by a famine so severe that Abram went down to
Egypt to live there for a time. 11 As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to
his wife Sarai, ‘ I am well aware that you are a beautiful woman, and 12 I know
that when the Egyptians see you and think, “She is his wife,” they will let you
live but they will kill me. 13 Tell them you are my sister, so that all may go
well with me because of you, and my life be spared on your account.’ 


12:14 When Abram arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was
indeed very beautiful, 15 and Pharaoh's courtiers, when they saw her, sang her
praises to Pharaoh. She was taken into Pharaoh's household, 16 and he treated
Abram well because of her, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle and donkeys, male
and female slaves, she-donkeys, and camels. 17 But when the Lord inflicted
plagues on Pharaoh and his household on account of Abram’s wife Sarai, 18
Pharaoh summoned Abram. ‘ Why have you treated me like this?’ he said. ‘ Why did
you not tell me she was your wife? 19 Why did you say she was your sister, so
that I took her as a wife? Here she is: take her and go.’ 20 Pharaoh gave his
men orders, and they sent Abram on his way with his wife and all that belonged
to him. 

13:1 From Egypt Abram went up into the Negeb, he and his wife and all
that he possessed, and Lot went with him. 2 Abram had become very rich in
cattle and in silver and gold. 3 From the Negeb he journeyed by stages towards
Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where he had earlier pitched his
tent, 4 and where he had previously set up an altar and invoked the Lord by
name. 5 Since Lot, who was travelling with Abram, also possessed sheep and
cattle and tents, 6 the land could not support them while they were together.
They had so much livestock that they could not settle in the same district, 7
and quarrels arose between Abram's herdsmen and Lot’s. (The Canaanites and the
Perizzites were then living in the land.) 8 Abram said to Lot, ‘ There must be
no quarrelling between us, or between my herdsmen and yours; for we are close
kinsmen. 9 The whole country is there in front of you. Let us part company: if
you go north, I shall go south; if you go south, I shall go north.’ 10 Lot
looked around and saw how well watered the whole plain of Jordan was; all the
way to Zoar it was like the Garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt. This was
before the Lord had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. 11 So Lot chose all the
Jordan plain and took the road to the east. They parted company: 12 Abram
settled in Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the plain and pitched
his tent near Sodom. 13 Now the men of Sodom in their wickedness had committed
monstrous sins against the Lord.  


13:14 After Lot and Abram had parted, the Lord said to Abram, ‘ Look
around from where you are towards north, south, east, and west: 15 all the land
you see I shall give to you and to your descendants for ever. 16 I shall make
your descendants countless as the dust of the earth; only if the specks of dust 
on the ground could be counted could your descendants be counted. 17 Now go
through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.’ 18
Abram moved his tent and settled by the terebinths of Mamre at Hebron, where he
built an altar to the Lord. 

14:1 In those days King Amraphel of Shinar, King Arioch of Ellasar, King
Kedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goyim 2 went to war against King Bera of
Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboyim,
and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 3 These kings joined forces in the valley
of Siddim, which is now the Dead Sea. 4 For twelve years they had been subject
to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 5 Then in the
fourteenth year Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him came and defeated the
Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
6 and the Horites in their hill-country, Seir as far as El-paran on the edge of
the wilderness. 7 On their way back they came to En-mishpat, which is now
Kadesh, and laid waste all the territory of the Amalekites as well as that of
the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar. 8 Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah,
Admah, Zeboyim, and Bela, which is now Zoar, marched out and drew up their
forces against them in the valley of Siddim, 9 against King Kedorlaomer of
Elam, King Tidal of Goyim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar,
four kings against five. 10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits,
and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of their men fell into them,
but the rest made their escape to the hills. 11 The four kings captured all the
flocks and herds of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their provisions, and withdrew,
12 carrying off Abram's nephew, Lot, who was living in Sodom, and his flocks and
herds. 

14:13 A fugitive brought the news to Abram the Hebrew, who at that time
had his camp by the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite. This Mamre was the brother
of Eshcol and Aner, allies of Abram. 14 When Abram heard that his kinsman had
been taken prisoner, he mustered his three hundred and eighteen retainers, men
born in his household, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 15 Abram and his
followers surrounded the enemy by night, routed them, and pursued them as far as
Hobah, north of Damascus. 16 He recovered all the flocks and herds and also his
kinsman Lot with his flocks and herds, together with the women and all his
company. 17 On Abram’s return from defeating Kedorlaomer and the allied kings,
the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the valley of Shaveh, which is now the
King’s Valley. 18 Then the king of Salem, Melchizedek, brought food and wine.
He was priest of God Most High, 19 and he pronounced this blessing on Abram:
‘ Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of the heavens and the earth. 20
And blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.’
Then Abram gave him a tithe of all the booty. 


 14:21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, ‘ Give me the people, and you can
take the livestock.’ 22 But Abram replied, ‘ I lift my hand and swear by the
Lord, God Most High, Creator of the heavens and the earth : 23 not a thread or a
sandal-thong shall I accept of anything that is yours. You will never say, “ I
made Abram rich.” 24 I shall accept nothing but what the young men have eaten
and the share of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; they must
have their share.’


15:1 After this the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision. He said,
‘ Do not be afraid, Abram; I am your shield. Your reward will be very great.’ 2
Abram replied, ‘ Lord God, what can you give me, seeing that I am childless? The
heir to my household is Eliezer of Damascus. 3 You have given me no children,
and so my heir must be a slave born in my house.’ 4 The word of the Lord came
to him: ‘ This man will not be your heir; your heir will be a child of your own
body.’ 5 He brought Abram outside and said, ‘ Look up at the sky, and count the
stars, if you can. So many will your descendants be.’ 

15:6
Abram put his faith in the Lord, who reckoned it to him as
righteousness, 7 and said, ‘ I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the
Chaldees to give you this land as your possession.’ 8 Abram asked, ‘ Lord God,
how can I be sure that I shall occupy it?’ 9 The Lord answered, ‘ Bring me a
heifer three years old, a she-goat three years old, a ram three years old, a
turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.’ 10 Abram brought him all these, cut the
animals in two, and set the pieces opposite each other, but he did not cut the
birds in half. 11 Birds of prey swooped down on the carcasses, but he scared
them away. 12 As the sun was going down, Abram fell into a trance and great and
fearful darkness came over him. 13 The Lord said to Abram, ‘ Know this for
certain: your descendants will be aliens living in a land that is not their own;
they will be enslaved and held in oppression for four hundred years. 14 But I
shall punish the nation whose slaves they are, and afterwards they will depart
with great possessions. 15 You yourself will join your forefathers in peace and
be buried at a ripe old age. 16 But it will be the fourth generation who will
return here, for till then the Amorites will not be ripe for punishment.’ 17
The sun went down and it was dusk, and there appeared a smoking brazier and a
flaming torch which passed between the divided pieces. 18 That day the Lord
made a covenant with Abram, and said, ‘ I give to your descendants this land from
the river of Egypt to the Great River, the river Euphrates, 19 the territory of
the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 20 Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaim, 21
Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.’

16:1
Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no children. She had, however, an
Egyptian slave-girl named Hagar, 2 and Sarai said to Abram, ‘ The Lord has not
let me have a child. Take my slave-girl; perhaps through her I shall have a
son.’ Abram heeded what his wife said; 3 so Sarai brought her slave-girl, Hagar
the Egyptian, to her husband and gave her to Abram as a wife. When this happened
Abram had been in Canaan for ten years. 4 He lay with Hagar and she conceived;
and when she knew that she was pregnant, she looked down on her mistress. 5
Sarai complained to Abram, ‘ I am being wronged; you must do something about it.
It was I who gave my slave-girl into your arms, but since she has known that she
is pregnant, she has despised me. May the Lord see justice done between you and
me.’ 6 Abram replied, ‘ Your slave-girl is in your hands; deal with her as you
please.’ So Sarai ill-treated her and she ran away from her mistress.

16:7
The angel of the Lord came upon Hagar by a spring in the wilderness,
the spring on the road to Shur, 8 and he said, ‘ Hagar, Sarai's slave-girl,
where have you come from and where are you going?’ She answered, ‘ I am running
away from Sarai my mistress.’ 9 The angel of the Lord said to her, ‘ Go back to
your mistress and submit to ill-treatment at her hands.’ 10 He also said, ‘ I
shall make your descendants too many to be counted.’ 11 The angel of the Lord
went on: ‘ You are with child and will bear a son. You are to name him Ishmael,
because the Lord has heard of your ill-treatment. 12 He will be like the wild
ass; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him; and he
will live at odds with all his kin.’ 13 Hagar called the Lord who spoke to her
by the name El-roi, for she said, ‘ Have I indeed seen God and still live after
that vision?’ 14 That is why the well is called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between
Kadesh and Bered. 15 Hagar bore Abram a son, and he named the child she bore
him Ishmael. 16 Abram was eighty-six years old when she bore Ishmael.

17:1
When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and
said, ‘ I am God Almighty. Live always in my presence and be blameless, 2 so
that I may make my covenant with you and give you many descendants.’ 3 Abram
bowed low, and God went on, 4 ‘ This is my covenant with you: you are to be the
father of many nations. 5 Your name will no longer be Abram, but Abraham; for I
shall make you father of many nations. 6 I shall make you exceedingly fruitful;
I shall make nations out of you, and kings shall spring from you. 7 I shall
maintain my covenant with you and your descendants after you, generation after
generation, an everlasting covenant: I shall be your God, yours and your
descendants'. 8 As a possession for all time I shall give you and your
descendants after you the land in which you now are aliens, the whole of Canaan,
and I shall be their God.’

17:9
God said to Abraham, ‘ For your part, you must keep my covenant, you
and your descendants after you, generation by generation. 10 This is how you
are to keep this covenant between myself and you and your descendants after you:
circumcise yourselves, every male among you. 11 You must circumcise the flesh
of your foreskin, and it will be the sign of the covenant between us. 12 Every
male among you in every generation must be circumcised on the eighth day, both
those born in your house and any foreigner, not a member of your family but
purchased. 13 Circumcise both those born in your house and those you buy; thus
your flesh will be marked with the sign of my everlasting covenant. 14 Every
uncircumcised male, everyone who has not had the flesh of his foreskin
circumcised, will be cut off from the kin of his father; he has broken my
covenant.’


17:15
God said to Abraham, ‘ As for Sarai your wife, you are to call her
not Sarai, but Sarah. 16 I shall bless her and give you a son by her. I shall
bless her and she will be the mother of nations; from her kings of peoples will
spring.’ 17 Abraham bowed low, and laughing said to himself, ‘ Can a son be born
to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah bear a child at ninety?’ 18 He
said to God, ‘ If only Ishmael might enjoy your special favour!’ 19 But God
replied, ‘ No; your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you are to call him
Isaac. With him I shall maintain my covenant as an everlasting covenant for his
descendants after him. 20 But I have heard your request about Ishmael; I have
blessed him and I shall make him fruitful. I shall give him many descendants; he
will be father of twelve princes, and I shall raise a great nation from him. 21
But my covenant I shall fulfil with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this
time next year.’ 22 When he had finished talking with Abraham, God left him.

17:23
Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, everyone who had been born in
his household and everyone he had bought, every male in his household, and that
same day he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins as God had commanded him.
24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised. 25 Ishmael was
thirteen years old when he was circumcised. 26 Both Abraham and Ishmael were
circumcised on the same day. 27 All the men of Abraham’s household, born in the
house or bought from foreigners, were circumcised with him.

18:1
The Lord appeared to Abraham by the terebinths of Mamre, as he was
sitting at the opening of his tent in the heat of the day. 2 He looked up and
saw three men standing over against him. On seeing them, he hurried from his
tent door to meet them. Bowing low 3 he said, ‘ Sirs, if I have deserved your
favour, do not go past your servant without a visit. 4 Let me send for some
water so that you may bathe your feet; and rest under this tree, 5 while I
fetch a little food so that you may refresh yourselves. Afterwards you may
continue the journey which has brought you my way.’ They said, ‘ Very well, do as
you say.’ 6 So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, ‘ Quick, take
three measures of flour, knead it, and make cakes.’ 7 He then hastened to the
herd, chose a fine, tender calf, and gave it to a servant, who prepared it at
once. 8 He took curds and milk and the calf which was now ready, set it all
before them, and there under the tree waited on them himself while they ate.

18:9
They asked him where Sarah his wife was, and he replied, ‘ She is in
the tent.’ 10 One of them said, ‘ About this time next year I shall come back to
you, and your wife Sarah will have a son.’ Now Sarah was listening at the
opening of the tent close by him. 11 Both Abraham and Sarah were very old,
Sarah being well past the age of childbearing. 12 So she laughed to herself and
said, ‘ At my time of life I am past bearing children, and my husband is old.’
13 The Lord said to Abraham, ‘ Why did Sarah laugh and say, “Can I really bear a
child now that I am so old?” 14 Is anything impossible for the Lord? In due
season, at this time next year, I shall come back to you, and Sarah will have a
son.’ 15 Because she was frightened, Sarah lied and denied that she had
laughed; but he said, ‘ Yes, you did laugh.’

18:16
The men set out and looked down towards Sodom, and Abraham went
with them to see them on their way. 17 The Lord had thought to himself, ‘ Shall
I conceal from Abraham what I am about to do? 18 He will become a great and
powerful nation, and all nations on earth will wish to be blessed as he is
blessed. 19 I have singled him out so that he may charge his sons and family
after him to conform to the way of the Lord and do what is right and just; thus
I shall fulfil for him all that I have promised.’ 20 The Lord said, ‘ How great
is the outcry over Sodom and Gomorrah! How grave their sin must be! 21 I shall
go down and see whether their deeds warrant the outcry reaching me. I must know
the truth.’ 22 When the men turned and went off towards Sodom, Abraham remained
standing before the Lord. 23 Abraham drew near him and asked, ‘ Will you really
sweep away innocent and wicked together? 24 Suppose there are fifty innocent in
the city; will you really sweep it away, and not pardon the place because of the
fifty innocent there? 25 Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill innocent
and wicked together; for then the innocent would suffer with the wicked. Far be
it from you! Should not the judge of all the earth do what is just?’ 26 The
Lord replied, ‘ If I find in Sodom fifty innocent, I shall pardon the whole place
for their sake.’ 27 Abraham said, ‘ May I make so bold as to speak to the Lord,
I who am nothing but dust and ashes: 28 suppose there are five short of fifty
innocent? Will you destroy the whole city for the lack of five men?’ ‘ If I find
forty-five there,’ he replied, ‘ I shall not destroy it.’ 29 Abraham spoke
again, ‘ Suppose forty can be found there?’ ‘ For the sake of the forty I shall
not do it,’ he replied. 30 Then Abraham said, ‘ Let not my Lord become angry if
I speak again: suppose thirty can be found there?’ He answered, ‘ If I find
thirty there, I shall not do it.’ 31 Abraham continued, ‘ May I make so bold as
to speak to the Lord: suppose twenty can be found there?’ He replied, ‘ For the
sake of the twenty I shall not destroy it.’ 32 Abraham said, ‘ Let not my Lord
become angry if I speak just once more: suppose ten can be found there?’ ‘ For
the sake of the ten I shall not destroy it,’ said the Lord. 33 When the Lord
had finished talking to Abraham, he went away, and Abraham returned home.

19:1
The two angels came to Sodom in the evening while Lot was sitting by
the city gate. When he saw them, he rose to meet them and bowing low 2 he said,
‘ I pray you, sirs, turn aside to your servant’s house to spend the night there
and bathe your feet. You can continue your journey in the morning.’ ‘ No,’ they
answered, ‘ we shall spend the night in the street.’ 3 But Lot was so insistent
that they accompanied him into his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking
unleavened bread for them to eat.
