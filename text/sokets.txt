IP = Internet Protocol

WWW = World Wide Web

The Internet consists of the following groups of networks:
	- Backbones: large NAP = Network access points, IXP = Internet Exchange Points;
	- Regional
	- Commercial
	- Local

Multiple networks interconnected by routers.

=======
IoT - Internet of Things

OSI:
	7. Application
	6. Presentation
	5. Session
	4. Transport
	3. Network
	2. Data Link
	1. Physical

Physical - voltage level, pins, radio frequency
Data Link - protocol for directly communication between to nodes - framing, error detection (and correction), flow control
Network - transmi data sequence (packets).
Transport - reliably deliver between hosts, splitting up data, recombining, ensuring data arrives
Session - adding methods to establish, checkpoint, suspend, resume, and terminate dialogs
Presentation - data structure and presentation for an application are defined - data encoding, serialization, encryption and handled
Application - user interfaces

L7 - Web browser, HTTP used to transmit web pages.

Chunks of data are oftern referred to by different names depending on the OSI layer they are on. L2 - frame, L3 - packet, L4 - segment / datagram

TCI/IP model - Network Access, Internet, Host-to-host, process/application.

IP in two versions: IPv4 and IPv6.
