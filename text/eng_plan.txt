Plan for the year:

I am planning to learn english up to upper intermediate level.
I am going to read books on English every day. Maybe I will to spent up to several hours every day.
I also am going to start to watch movies on English, I want to watch one of my favourite serial movies -
doctor House or Clan Soprano.
I will be written my progress in special file to track how I will grow.
I think that vocabulary about 10 thousands of words will be enough for fluent speaking.
I also will watch some interesting TED podcast in original.
