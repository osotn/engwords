Software is integral to delivering highly functional and safe products

by Steven Servaes, Melexis

When designing hardware products, software is often a differentiator that delivers
key benefits for OEMs and end users. Software also offers the ability to upgrade
the product during its lifetime, adding new features or adding compatibility with
new standards and protocols.

Safe critical applications
--------------------------

In the automotive arena, safety is a critical concern to component manufacturers,
vehicle makers and consumers. Software is at least as important as hardware in
ensuring safety of vehicle drivers, passengers and other road users.
As a result, standards define stringent processes that software developers must
follow to ensure the safety of automotive systems.

In this article, Melexis looks how software intertwines with hardware and considers
impact of automotive safety standards on design processes as well as giving some
insight to the internal processes that ensure their software and products meet
the highest standards.

While many companies may, at first, appear to be solely hardware oriented, software
plays a very significant role within the industry in two key areas; development tools
and software that is included in their silicon based product. The embedded software
aspect is particularly crucial as it relates to safety critical applications such
as automotive.
