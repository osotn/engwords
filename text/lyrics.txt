Chris De Burgh
The Lady in Red
---------------
I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright, mhhm hm
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch you eyes I have been blind
The lady in red is dancing with me, cheek to cheek
There's nobody here, it's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight
I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright You were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to be there
by your side and when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away
And I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love as I do tonight

The lady in red is dancing with me, cheek to cheek
There's nobody here, it's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight
I'll never forget the way you look tonight
The lady in red
The lady in red
The lady in red
My  lady in red

Hotel California
-----------------
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up to the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be heaven and this could be hell
The she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty room at the hotel California
Any time of year
You can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
Uh she got a lot of pretty pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the captain
Please bring me my wine
And said we haven't had that spirit here since 1969
