Britain has always meant more than “England,” although for many
English and for many outside England this meaning has been allowed
for centuries to assume a role of singular importance. At one time or
another in history, 

Britain has incorporated:
    - England,
    - Wales,
    - Scotland,
    - Ireland,
    - the smaller islands surrounding these larger isles,
    - parts of what is now France,
    - great chunks of North and South America,
    - large portions of both Africa and Asia, and the whole of Australasia. 

Britain has also, by choice or by compulsion, divested itself of many of these
holdings but has left indelible traces of British culture behind.


Perhaps the best place to start is with a quick geographical primer.

    - England (capital London),
    - Scotland (capital Edinburgh),
    - Wales (capital Cardiff) 
    - are all part of the contemporary entity known as Great Britain.
    
    All three of these, along with Northern Ireland, are part
of the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” or
United Kingdom = UK

    Very often, the United Kingdom is also referred to
as simply “Britain,” and today “British” is often held to describe and
refer to the entire United Kingdom.

The entirety of Ireland was part
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from the 1801 Act
of Union through 1921, when it was divided by the Anglo - Irish Treaty
into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland.

The Irish Free State changed its name to Éire in 1937 before becoming
the Republic of Ireland in 1948. It includes the 26 southern counties of the former larger
Ireland, and its capital is Dublin.

Northern Ireland, which remains
part of the United Kingdom, is made up of the six northeastern counties, including Ulster, and its capital is Belfast

Within the geographical perimeter of the British Isles, the Channel
Islands (Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, and several smaller islands),
and the Isle of Man are crown dependencies, self-governing possessions of the Crown, which are overseen by lieutenant governors but
with relative autonomy. They are not included in the formal United
Kingdom, nor are they members of the Commonwealth of Nations or
the European Union. The Shetland and Orkney Isles, by contrast, are
counties of Scotland, and Anglesey is a county of Wales.

But Britain is not and has never been limited to these areas. The British Empire at its peak spanned the globe, and in the years after World
War I, as it began to be dismantled, commonwealth status replaced
colonial status for much of the empire. The British Commonwealth of
Nations was formally established in 1931 to include the white-settled
dominions that had been self-governing for decades:
    - Canada,
    - Newfoundland,
    - Australia,
    - New Zealand,
    - South Africa,
    - the Irish Free State.
    
    As decolonization progressed in the years after World War II,
commonwealth status was granted to those new nations that chose
to belong. Today, the Commonwealth embraces 52 nations, most of
which are former British colonies or have some strong relationship
with a former colony (e.g., Samoa and New Zealand). These members
recognize the British monarch as the symbolic head of the organization
but share little else except a common history of British rule. Membership is voluntary, but applications for membership must be approved
by the Commonwealth Heads of Government.

The British Isles themselves are, especially to Americans, quite
small. Their entire area—93,000 square miles for the United Kingdom
and 27,135 square miles for the Republic of Ireland—is only slightly
larger than New England. Yet within this small area, there is great geographic diversity, from the moors of Devon and the fens, or swamps,
of the southeast to the highlands and lowlands of Scotland. The climate is tempered by the effects of Atlantic currents, so that while the
varieties of weather include snow and heat, extremes of temperature
or precipitation are rare. Certain areas, such as Scotland and Wales,
receive some 200 days of rain a year, although most of England and
Ireland is less perpetually soggy.

ETHNICITY AND CULTURE, CLASS, AND RELIGION
The 2017 announcement of the engagement of Prince Harry, at the
time fifth in line to the throne, to actress Meghan Markle — American,
divorced, biracial — opened a new chapter of gossipy interest in “the
royals” as it also challenged the cultural attitudes of many in the
United Kingdom. Much of the negative press surrounding the engagement reflected deep racial and social antagonisms that have surfaced
as the country has aged and become increasingly diverse.


Census figures for 2011 placed the overall UK population at 63.2 million (an increase of some 7% since 2001), with 53 million people in
England, 5.3 million in Scotland, 3.1 million in Wales, and 1.8 million
in Northern Ireland. The robust growth in population comes not only
from longer life expectancies (especially for aging baby boomers) and
higher birth rates but also from net migration (the numbers of immigrants minus the numbers of emigrants), which has risen steadily since
2012. This growth rate is about twice the growth rate for the European
Union as a whole (0.53% vs. 0.25%).1 Brexit will undoubtedly modify
this growth trend, as most of the increase in immigration has come
from working-age men and women from EU countries.

This growing population is aging. Of the 63 million inhabitants of
the United Kingdom noted in 2011, 18 percent are below 16 years of
age, 66 percent are between 16 and 64 years, and 16 percent are above
65 years.2 (In 2001, these figures were 20%, 59%, and 21%, respectively.) The population is also changing in terms of ethnicity and culture. While the population of Northern Ireland is mostly white, the
numbers of those in the rest of the United Kingdom who claim mixed
and nonwhite ethnicity have grown considerably since 1980. Census
figures from 2011 indicate that 86 percent claim white ethnicity, a
decrease from 94 percent in 2001. Of the 13 percent born outside the
United Kingdom, one-third emigrated from Europe (primarily from
EU member countries), another third from the Middle East or Asia
(primarily Iraq or Iran), and one-fifth from Africa (primarily Egypt or
South Africa). Religious affiliations among those arriving since 2001
indicate that the largest numbers of immigrants identify as Buddhist,
Christian, Muslim, or “no religion.” These rapid changes in ethnicity and cultural background have affected especially cities and towns,
and it is not surprising that the strongest push for Brexit has come from
areas outside London, as suburban and rural voters with little daily
exposure to immigrants were the prime demographic in favor of leaving the EU. (Voters in London and in Scotland, Wales, and Northern
Ireland voted overwhelmingly to remain, for reasons we will explore
at the end of this volume.)


The rapid influx of immigrants over the past 20 years has inevitably placed great burdens on infrastructure even while these men and
women have helped strengthen the overall economy. They also, inevitably, have helped reshape a British culture that has always included
elements of empire, from the late 19th-century craze for all things
Egyptian to the 20th-century Jamaican influence on popular music.
Anti-immigrant sentiment has been an unfortunate part of British
culture for the past two centuries, focusing on obvious differences in
religion, race, and cultural habits and worsening at times of economic
stagnation—ranging from the Irish potato famine of the 1840s to the
period beginning with the Cold War. As we will see in Chapter 12, the
influence of modern anti-immigrant propaganda ties into what some
observers have called the “order/openness” divide among voters,
resulting in a tendency to conflate particular forms of white nationalism with perceptions of safety, on the one hand, and cultural heterogeneity with perceptions of chaos and danger, on the other.

These ethnic differences—significant enough to attract the attention of social critics, artists, and politicians beginning in the mid-19th
century—have tended to complicate rather than to erase Britain’s
traditionally very strong class divisions. In areas where there are
fewer issues of race, class alone remains as divisive as it was at the
height of the 19th century. Former deputy prime minister John L.
Prescott, who was born into a Welsh working-class family, is said to
have proclaimed in 1997 that “we’re all middle class now,”3 but this
middle class continues to be subdivided in ways that reflect not only
income but also consumer preferences, education, vocabulary, and
technological savvy. Markers of class still include accent, although
this has been complicated by the deliberate adoption of down-scale
pronunciation by those rejecting “received pronunciation” or “BBC
English,” beginning in the 1970s. They also include leisure preferences, although this too has been complicated with the enthusiastic
embrace of soap operas rooted not just in the working classes (e.g.,
the long-running Coronation Street and EastEnders) but also in the
stratified middle classes portrayed in Made in Chelsea and The Only
Way Is Essex. Even a preference for football (U.S. soccer), traditionally
the most quintessential of working-class leisure pursuits, has crossed
class lines, largely because tickets to live events have become prohibitively expensive.

While divisions between and among middle and working classes
have been increasingly inflected by ethnicity and race, the upper class 
has remained relatively homogeneous. The continued existence of a
hereditary aristocracy is a source of endless fascination for Americans
and often for the British as well. It is outlined in all of its complexity
in both the annual Debrett’s Peerage and the less-frequent Burke’s Peerage. The highest rank within the peerage is duke or duchess, a title limited to the royal family. Dukes are territorial titles; that is, one is a Duke
of Northumberland because the family territory is in Northumberland.
Other titles often incorporate the family name rather than the territory. The highest rank held by an individual outside the royal family is
marquess (sometimes “marquis”) or marchioness. This is followed in
descending order by earl / countess, viscount / viscountess, and baron /
baroness. At the bottom of the ladder of hereditary titles is that of baronet, which is, essentially, an inherited form of knighthood reserved
to men (only four women have carried the title of baronetess in British
history). Knighthood itself is an honor conferred by the Crown on men
and women to recognize service in various ways, ranging from traditional military service to popularity in the theater or sport, and is for
life only. Neither baronets nor knights are peers; that is, they remain
commoners and may not be included in the House of Lords. Baronetcies pass to male heirs, but knighthood is not inheritable.

In addition to the hereditary peers are the life peers, recognized as
such for achievement or service to the country, who usually hold the
title of baron or baroness. The late prime minister Margaret Thatcher,
for example, was given the rank of baroness on retirement, enabling
her to sit in the House of Lords, and was called “Lady Margaret
Thatcher” until her death. The actor Lawrence Olivier was similarly
honored in 1970 as “Baron Olivier.” Life peers hold titles that cannot
be inherited, although their children may adopt “The Honourable” as
part of their own styling.

Children of hereditary peers may accumulate a number of titles on
their own but will always be referred to by their highest honor, which
will change when they inherit new titles on the death of a parent.
Thus, if the Duke of Bedford dies, his son, the Marquess of Tavistock,
automatically becomes the new Duke of Bedford and is subsequently
referred to as such. The same holds true when any individual is
granted a new title; for example, when Benjamin Disraeli, the (untitled) 19th-century prime minister, was made the Earl of Beaconsfield
(a title that died with him) by Queen Victoria, he was “Disraeli” until
1876 and “Beaconsfield” thereafter. Similarly, the 18th-century man of
letters Horace Walpole became the Earl of Orford (a hereditary title)
in 1742 and was known subsequently as “Orford” in official records
and correspondence

Since the 1950s, many politically minded children of hereditary
peers have renounced their titles, primarily because the inheritance of
a peerage means immediate translation from the House of Commons,
where political power is considerable, to the House of Lords, where it
is not. Thus, for instance, the Labour politician Anthony Wedgewood
Benn fought for the right to renounce the title of Viscount Stansgate
and was known simply as “Tony Benn” until his death in 2014. Benn’s
actions in 1960 led to the 1963 Peerage Act that provided for the renunciation of “unwanted” titles by members of the House of Lords

The Church of England is as complicated as the peerage. Also
known as the Anglican Church, it is the traditional established, or
state, religion of England. The Church has successfully fought several
battles against disestablishment, the formal removal from its position
as a part of the state. Until 1920, the Anglican Church was also the
established, or state, church of Wales, but it was disestablished as the
state church of Wales that year; as the Church of Wales, it remains part
of the Anglican Communion. In Scotland, the state church is the Kirk,
which is Presbyterian. In Northern Ireland, there is no state church,
but most of the 66 percent Protestant majority are either Presbyterian
or Church of Ireland (Anglican).

Within the Anglican Church in England, the highest authority
resides in the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose province now has 30
dioceses; his counterpart, the Archbishop of York, presides over 12.
Each diocese is in turn presided over by a bishop within a cathedral.
The first female Church of England Bishop was consecrated in January 2015. Below the bishop in each diocese are the archdeacon and the
dean. Administratively, the Church of England is divided into parishes, each with its own church. Until the New Poor Law of 1834, one
of the most important functions of each parish, in addition to religious
care, was the care of the poor within its geographical boundaries. The
priest of the church is referred to as the rector or the vicar.


Despite the persistence of an established state church (Anglican or
Presbyterian), the United Kingdom shares with other Western countries a gradual but significant decline in Christian religious practice.
The 2011 census returns indicated that nearly 60 percent of respondents
in England and Wales considered themselves Christian, down from
nearly 72 percent in 2001; the next largest affiliation was Muslim (4.8%,
up from 3.0% in 2001). About 25 percent indicated “no religion,” up
from 14.8 percent in 2001. In 2011, slightly more than 2 percent indicated Hindu, Buddhist, Judaism, or Sikh; approximately 0.5 percent
indicated “other,” which included both established groups such as Jain
and less traditional groups such as Jedi or “heavy metal.”4 In Scotland,
the 2011 census indicated that 54 percent of the population claimed affiliation with some form of Christianity (down from 65% in 2001), while
37 percent indicated “no religion” (up from 9% in 2001);5 1.4 percent
identified as Muslim in 2011, up from 0.09 percent in 2001.6 Surveys of
actual practice, rather than formal affiliation, indicate that attendance
at most established Christian churches has dropped precipitously over
the past several decades, with nearly half of members reporting that
they do not attend services regularly.7 As we will see in later chapters,
the changing nature of religious belief in the United Kingdom has had
significant impact on local, national, and imperial identities.

GOVERNMENT
Britain is a constitutional monarchy where most power now resides
in the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament. This was
not always the case. The shift from “crown” to “crown-in-parliament”
took many decades, a regicide, several civil wars, and an abdication.
Today the queen, Elizabeth II, is a figurehead. However, for many her
symbolic functions are crucial to the “Britishness” of Britain. Ongoing arguments over the wealth and responsibilities of the royal family
erupt periodically in calls for the abolition of the Crown. The personal
disasters of many of Elizabeth’s children—especially the public life
and early death of Diana, the first wife of the current prince of Wales,
which provided ample for journalists—have led some to argue
that the royal family is more burden than boon. When a fire gutted
part of Windsor Castle in 1992, the year Elizabeth herself referred to as
an annus horribilis, the question of who should pay for the $62 million
in repairs highlighted the larger question of whether the monarchy
was anything more than a drain on the economy. Yet in 2002, when
Elizabeth celebrated her Golden Jubilee, much of the British public
warmly congratulated the queen on the 50 years of her reign. By the
time Prince William, second in line to the throne, married Catherine
Middleton in 2011, public sentiment was overwhelmingly positive for
“Will and Kate.” Even the most cynical observers now doubt that the
monarchy will be abolished anytime soon and are resigned to the continuation of a symbolic Crown that still wields important emotional 
and persuasive powers. Indeed, the popularity of the multi-season
dramas The Crown, portraying the reign of Elizabeth II, and Victoria,
testifies to the continued fascination of the royal family past and present, both in the United Kingdom and abroad.

Real political power is vested in the House of Commons, the lower
house that along with the House of Lords constitutes the British
Parliament, which sits in the borough of Westminster in London. Most
political and government offices are located on Whitehall Street, many
of them in Whitehall Palace. As a result, the government itself is often
referred to as “Whitehall.” In this text, “Westminster” refers to the
Parliament, and “Whitehall” refers to the ministries of the Crown.

A series of reform bills in the 19th and early 20th centuries extended
the franchise to the entire adult population. Some 66 percent of voters participated in the 2015 general election.8 Parliament is in session
annually. The 2011 Fixed Term Parliament Act mandates a general
election every five years, on the first Thursday of May. Under certain circumstances—a motion from within the House of Commons
with two-thirds support, or a vote of “no confidence” in the existing
government—a general election can be called before the five-year
period is up. So-called by-elections are held in individual districts if
an MP (member of Parliament) dies or retires within that five-year
period. A total of 650 MPs represent the United Kingdom: in 2017,
there were 442 men and 208 women returned as MPs. Of that total, 19
represent Northern Ireland, 59 represent Scotland, and 40 represent
Wales. In addition, there are “devolved” governments for Northern
Ireland (the Northern Ireland Executive), Scotland (the Scottish Executive), and Wales (the Welsh Assembly Government). Created in 1998
after local referenda, each of these devolved governments sits regularly to consider subjects not explicitly reserved to the UK Parliament,
including health, education, justice, and agriculture. Each has its own
first or prime minister and a cabinet of ministers

Although there are several smaller parties, the parliament in Westminster is essentially a two-party system. Today these parties are the
Conservatives, occasionally still referred to as the Tories, and Labour.
Since 1945 the control of government has been in the hands of one or
the other of those parties without much input from the smaller parties,
which include the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Nationalist Party,
Plaid Cymru (the Welsh Independence Party), the UK Independence
Party (which spearheaded Brexit), and the Green Party. Coalition government is common on the continent, but it is and has always been
singularly absent in England, although it is much more the norm in
the devolved governments of Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

Parliament itself is made up of the House of Lords and the House
of Commons. Hereditary peers sit in the House of Lords, a privilege
that was limited to men until 1958, when female life peers gained that
right. As noted earlier, female hereditary peers were not permitted to
sit in the House of Lords until 1963. The House of Lords retains the 
power to debate important issues and to delay certain nontax measures passed by the House of Commons, although any measure passed
by the Commons in two successive years becomes law despite any
vote by the House of Lords. The head of the House of Lords is the Lord
Chancellor. The 1963 Peerage Act, which permitted the renunciation
of titles, also enabled female hereditary peers to sit and eliminated
the requirement that Scottish peers select only 16 from among their
number to represent them all. In 1999, a modified House of Lords Act
called for the elimination of all but 92 hereditary peers, as a steppingstone to a completely elected House of Lords. As of 2018, several proposals for a fully elected House of Lords have been debated, but no
further changes have been made.


The powers of the Lords form only a very moderate check on the
House of Commons, whose 651 MPs represent Britain’s 651 constituencies, including those in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
These MPs receive a salary, unlike the peers who sit in the House of
Lords. However, real power is wielded not through the elected members of each district but rather through a ministerial system made
up of approximately 20 cabinet ministers—with specific duties and
responsibilities, such as education and housing—and some 70 noncabinet ministers, or “ministers without portfolio,” who lack these
specific departmental responsibilities and serve primarily as advisors
at large. These ministers, both with and without portfolio, are chosen
by the prime minister, who is technically only “first among equals”
but in reality wields tremendous power.

The prime minister’s residence and offices are located off Whitehall Street at 10 Downing Street; 11 Downing Street is the site of other
ministerial offices, and references are often made simply to “Downing
Street” as the source of ministerial decisions. A whip system maintains party unity. Members who do not vote as directed by the party
whip—an individual chosen for his or her powers of persuasion—
may lose all influence and support from the party and may not be
nominated by the party to run for subsequent election.

One of the oddities of the ministerial system that developed over the
course of the 20th century is the so-called Shadow Ministry. The party
not in power appoints members to form its own government, and each
of these members “shadows” the party in power. Thus, a shadow secretary of education would research and recommend policies regarding education for the minority party. This enables a relatively smooth
transition when government power changes party hands, based on a
strong working knowledge of the various aspects of administration 
and policy. Many party leaders rise through the ranks in this way.
Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher, for instance, served
in several shadow cabinet posts while Labour was in power in the
1970s.
To complicate matters further, all ministers are politicians rather than
experts in their field. Every department of government—education,
housing, and so on—is staffed by a bureaucracy led by the permanent
secretary, an individual trained in the field and with deep working
knowledge and experience that may be lacking in the minister.

Despite the location of most real power in the hands of ministers,
the House of Commons remains for many the public face of the parliamentary system. Debates are often televised, and the formal divisions and votes are open to the public. Within the chambers of the
House of Commons, the Speaker of the House (elected by the MPs as
a body) is located at the top of the chamber; the MPs whose party is
the majority—“the government”—sit to the right of the Speaker, and
the MPs in the minority party sit to the left. Ministers and shadow
ministers sit on the front benches on their respective sides, with nonministers on the back benches where they are known, not surprisingly,
as “back-benchers.” Minority MPs are known as Her Majesty’s Loyal
Opposition and have the right and duty to harangue the majority MPs
in debate and in the twice-weekly question-and-answer periods held
in the chambers. The Speaker of the House presides over these debates
and Q&A sessions and is responsible for ensuring that both majority
and minority opinions are presented.

INDUSTRY AND ECONOMY
While British literature and poetry have always celebrated the
idyllic qualities of the countryside, Britain—especially northern
England—was the first major area in Europe to industrialize. Today
only the south of England is still primarily rural. Scotland, with its
often - daunting terrain, still depends on fishing, oil, and sheep farming. Wales and Northern Ireland remain agricultural. All of the areas of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as the Republic of Ireland,
enjoy and depend on significant tourist traffic for economic health.

The United Kingdom’s primary industries include petroleum, cars
and planes, textiles, food processing, paper products, and chemicals,
although as the international economy has turned from manufactured
goods to intellectual capital, Britain and Ireland have made a similar
shift. Coal mining, long a staple of the British economy owing to significant coal reserves in northern England and in Wales, has declined
in recent years even as North Sea oil reserves have allowed Britain to
emerge as a major fuel exporter. Not surprisingly, and reflecting the
decline in trade and industry, union membership has fallen, to about
23.3 percent of all employed adults in Great Britain in 2016,9 with the
lowest levels of membership in the south and southeast and the highest in Wales (36%), Scotland (29%), and Northern Ireland (28%). In
summer 2017, overall unemployment rates were 4.3 percent in the
United Kingdom10 and 5.6 percent in the Republic of Ireland.11 The
per capita income in the United Kingdom for the same period was
U.S. $41,600.12 All of these figures indicate rapid growth, often significantly higher than that in the EU.

RELATIONS WITH EUROPE
As the major imperial power in the 19th century, Britain entered the
20th century looking away from the continent and toward the rest of
the globe. This perspective was forced to shift with decolonization and
world wars, both of which affected British social and economic stability, and again in the 2000s with active membership in the EU. The
implementation of Brexit will undoubtedly be equally challenging to
accommodate. As we will see in Chapter 12, Britain’s relations with
Europe, America, and the rest of the world are undergoing a seismic
shift, and we will explore them in detail later in the book.


2.
Roman and Anglo Saxon Britain
Pre roman and roman britain
-----------------------------

Little is known about the British Isles before written records,
which generally began with the Roman invasion of 55 bce. However, archaeological expeditions have uncovered some evidence of
human settlements dating back to approximately 17000 bce. More
evidence—including the remains of ornamental pottery, flint arrowheads, and agricultural artifacts—exists for settlements beginning
about 3000 bce. These groups are thought to have migrated from
Northern Europe to what is today the southeastern part of England
adjacent to the English Channel and then to have spread northward
into Yorkshire and westward into Ireland. Among the traditions of
these early inhabitants was the practice of burying their dead in communal “barrows,” or long mounds, some as long as 350 feet; several
of these are still visible today. A later wave of migrants, identified as
the Beaker People based on their pottery, joined these earliest barrow
peoples before the Bronze Age (about 2000 to 1000 bce). Several groups
of migrants crossed the English Channel during the Bronze Age, the 
most important of which has been named the Wessex Culture. By the
time of the Iron Age, settled farming sites were scattered throughout
the south, with life organized around both animal husbandry and
crop farming.

Perhaps the most immediate image of pre-Roman Britain is the
famous site of Stonehenge, a great stone circle now believed to have
originated as early as 2500 bce, during the time of the Beaker People. “Henge” means “hanging” or “hinged,” and Stonehenge was so
named because the giant circle on Salisbury Plain includes massive
stones that appear to be hanging in air, balanced on other stones in
almost impossible ways. Although neither the details behind its construction nor the reasons for the circle are clear, evidence suggests the
stones were quarried in Wales and then floated via riverways to their
final destination, for use as an observatory or for religious practices
that included sun worship. Other similar monuments were erected
throughout the region, with one dubbed Woodhenge just a few miles
from Salisbury Plain and others scattered as far away as the Lake District and the islands off Scotland. More than 900 stone circles still exist.

The wave of pre-Roman migrants known as the Celts came from
central Europe via Northern Europe in two waves, from about 2000
bce through 400 bce. Early Roman accounts link the Celts in Britain
to the Celts in Gaul and describe them as warlike, courageous, and
aggressive. The Romans also describe two additional warlike peoples, the Picts in Scotland and the Scots in Ireland, who were believed
to be related to the more widely scattered Celts. Fears that Celts in
Northern Europe would use the British Isles to launch an attack on
Roman outposts prompted Julius Caesar to sail to England in 55 bce
in a short-lived invasion. The Picts in the north would remain resistant to Roman incursions, but by 43 ce Roman rule was imposed in the
southeast of England by Emperor Claudius, in a system that organized the new conquest into distinct areas, each under a client king.
The center of this Roman occupation was Londinium; 7 of the first 15
roads in Britannia originated in the city, attesting to its early importance. The client king system was rife with corruption from the beginning, although it spawned only one major revolt, Queen Boudicca’s
ruthlessly suppressed Celtic uprising in 61 ce. Between about 70 and
160 ce, Roman rule was transformed under a series of leaders, who
gradually replaced the system of client kings with one of local administrators more closely tied both to the local inhabitants and to Roman
bureaucracy.

The earliest Roman governors had focused on a small Britannia that
encompassed much of southeast England, with a provincial capital
established in Colchester. Archaeological evidence also links Romans
to Ireland by about 78 ce and Lowland Scotland by about 81 ce. Within
a few decades, Roman rule extended north and west to Hadrian’s
Wall (begun 122), which stretched roughly from Newcastle to Carlisle. Hadrian’s successor, Antoninus Pius, ordered the construction
of another wall farther north to extend Roman control and to present
a defense against the Caledonian tribes of northern Scotland. Roman
rule in the north and far west was, however, always less secure than
in the southeast, and most Roman cities and towns were surrounded
by defensive walls designed to protect against the incursions of outlying tribes. The cities themselves—from London to the smaller centers
of Colchester, Verulamium, Exeter, Chester, and Carmarthen—were
characterized by a mix of market, government, and social functions,
ranging from council chambers to public baths, all used in various
degrees by populations that encompassed gentry and military officers, slaves and skilled laborers, businessmen and veterans. Rapid
growth and development led to the division of Britain into two provinces during this period, with Britannia Inferior centered around York
and Britannia Superior—so named because it was closer to Rome—
centered around London. Both cities were important centers not
only of military defense and government administration but also—
especially in the case of London—of international trade. Rapid movement of merchants and soldiers through these cities undoubtedly
helped spread the plague between 165 and 180. A constant influx of
immigrants contributed to the polyglot nature of Roman Britannia

This period of peace, marred increasingly by tribal attacks along the
northern and western frontiers and punctuated outside the borders
of Britannia by chaos and breakdown within the Roman Empire as
a whole, lasted until the middle of the third century. In 287 a senior
military officer named Carausius seized control as a local emperor in
his own right, and by the time the central Roman administration had
regained control of Britannia in 293, significant changes had been initiated throughout the entire empire by Emperor Diocletian. Economically, unprecedented levels of taxation were joined by new controls
on labor, which included the creation of a peasantry newly tied to the
land. Diocletian also sought to replace the untrammeled power of the
military with local and state governments more firmly under royal
control. Thus, he created new imperial offices, with two senior and
two junior emperors, or caesars, serving under him. It was the senior
caesar of the west, Constantius I, who presided over the reclamation of
the rebel Britannia, leading a series of battles against mercenary troops
from the continent and then fighting the Picts in Scotland in order to
secure the area. The reclaimed expanse, now the Diocese of the Britains, was overseen by a vicarius Britanniarum or vicar of the diocese,
the new administrative unit of the Roman Empire

Constantius’s successor, Constantine the Great (ca. 274–337), ushered in a golden age of prosperity and peace, during which Roman
Britain enjoyed the growth of local arts and industries. Within the territory bounded by Hadrian’s Wall, Britannia was subdivided into four
separate provinces, with Lincoln and Cirencester joining the ranks of
provincial capitals alongside London and York. By about 300, London had become the official capital of the entire diocese. Villa culture
flourished. Elaborate homes that included central heating and baths
formed a central focus for a community of smaller homes and agricultural outbuildings, linked as a whole to main roads but providing
a locus of aristocratic life separate from the towns and cities that were
ruled by royal bureaucracy and imperial army. Within this villa culture, Christianity quietly took root and spread, although when Christianity became the state religion under Constantine certain elements
of the villa aristocracy appear to have briefly embraced the old pagan
cults as a way to establish resistance to imperial power. By the middle
of the fourth century, however, heresy was a crime against the state
and was punished as such. Despite this edict, Christianity appears to
have been unevenly rooted in rural Britannia and even less securely
established in urban areas

Constantine’s golden age ended with his own life; power passed
violently from son to son until an army commander named Magnentius took control. The brutal program of suppression and murder after
Constantine’s death seriously impaired Britannia’s villa aristocracy,
and the diocese was further weakened when Picts and Scots launched
a series of invasions along the borders, taking advantage of internal
weakness to reclaim tribal ascendancy. In 367 a multipronged invasion of the empire took Roman Britain by surprise. United in what
would be termed the “Barbarian Conspiracy,” Picts, Scots, and other
tribes poured over the borders, looting and pillaging. Even famed city
walls could not protect urban areas from invasion, and military troops
deserted in large numbers until new forces were dispatched under the
leadership of Theodosius, whose son would become Emperor Theodosius the Great.

On the death of Emperor Theodosius in 395, the Roman Empire fell
into a period of further decay. Britannia was left largely to its own
devices, forced to defend itself against invasions by Saxons and others. By 409 it had thrown off nearly all its allegiance to a larger Roman
Empire and ejected its Roman administrators. The Roman machinery of central government was largely abandoned as Roman military
troops were recalled to Gaul to repel trouble on the continent, and
city leaders in Britannia were told to “look to their own defense” by
Emperor Honorius. Britannia pulled itself inward, devoting its powers to self-protection, in a long but relatively steady slide away from
the complex society of Roman Britain. The pottery industry collapsed
by the middle of the 400s; local coinage ceased at about the same time,
indicating that Britannia’s role in an international trading community
had faded. This does not mean that civilization itself ceased. Instead,
local power was taken into the hands of local leaders, as regional, provincial, and imperial ties began to fray. By about 450 the entire Roman

ANGLO-SAXON BRITAIN
In his famous Ecclesiastical History of the English People, the monk
known as the Venerable Bede in 731 sketched the history of the
Germani, the three major groups of Germanic invaders who began to
enter the British Isles as Roman rule collapsed. Angles and Saxons and
Jutes, all from northern Germany and the southern area of Denmark,
came in great numbers.

Many entered Britannia as mercenaries in the last decades of
Roman rule, earlier than the date of 449 identified by Bede. Others
were “invited” in to help protect settlements from the constant incursions of the Picts and Scots, now referred to generally as “Celts” along
with the other non-Roman Britons. By about 600, according to Bede’s
chronicle and other records, about half of the British Isles was under
the control of the Germani. Celts retained control of the other half:
Scotland remained in the hands of the Picts, while Ireland was home
to settlements of Scots. Roman Britons had fled much of the southeast
to escape the invaders, establishing three kingdoms in the north and
a number of kingdoms in Wales. The word “Welshman,” ironically,
came to mean “slave” and referred to the Britons who had escaped
to the west. Only traces of Roman rule and custom remained in the
Anglo-Saxon settlements that covered most of the rest of the former
Britannia.

Seventh-century England—the parts of the Isles now under the control of the Angles and Saxons and referred to as the land of the Angles,
or England, in Bede’s history—slowly organized itself into seven
large kingdoms. Wessex, home of the West Saxons, would eventually
emerge as the strongest of the so-called Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy, which
included Essex and Sussex (east and south Saxons, respectively), East
Anglia, Kent, Mercia (“middle Anglia”), and Northumbria. The Celtic
areas formed their own kingdoms to the north and east. Thus, the Isles
were a patchwork of kingdoms, each fighting first for its own survival
and then for control over its neighbors.

This early period was one of shifting allegiances and power struggles among the kingdoms. Larger kingdoms meant greater wealth;
greater wealth attracted greater military forces, which in their turn
were used to enlarge boundaries even further. But the system was
one that was constantly in flux, with kingdoms rarely enjoying prolonged periods of peace and stability. Kings followed kings in patterns that were not determined solely by kinship but that were instead
often dependent on the personal strength, charisma, and manipulative
abilities of individual men. A military aristocracy was key to this system of kingship, and personal loyalty often trumped bloodlines. Both
Bede’s History and the most famous epic of the period, Beowulf, illustrate the centrality of warrior culture to the early Anglo-Saxon period.
The purportedly more peaceful tenets of Christianity were not yet
strong enough to balance out these essentially pagan notions of power
and conquest.
In the countryside, peasants were generally free, rather than tied to
the land as would be the case in the later Anglo-Saxon period. They
were commonly responsible for a parcel of land called a hide, and with
each hide came obligations to the king, usually obligations in kind
such as grain or other commodities. Hides were themselves grouped
into manors, or blocks of land, that were granted to servants or lords to
the king. Blocks of land were also granted to the church as individual
kingdoms converted to Christianity in the decades following 590.

THE SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY
Christianity had entered Roman Britain by about 180 and spread
steadily, but lost numbers and influence in the waves of invasions by
the Germani. One of the few mentions of the early Christian church in
Britannia was the attention focused on the Briton Pelagius, who denied
the concept of original sin. The Pelagian heresy was repudiated by the
Council of Carthage in 416, but its continued popularity among the
remnants of Roman villa aristocracy required formal visits by Bishop
St. Germanus in 429 and again in 446 to root out the heresy. Another
bishop, St. Palladius, was sent to Ireland in 431 in the front line of
Christian efforts to evangelize more widely across the isles. A young
Briton, kidnapped and enslaved by Irish pirates, would escape and
eventually return to Ireland after Palladius, baptizing widely and
eventually becoming St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. Outside
of Ireland, however, these efforts were largely unsuccessful against
the many varieties of beliefs that jostled for ascendancy in the chaos of
post-Roman Britain.

The first major attempt by the Roman church to re-Christianize
the kingdoms came in 597 with the Roman monk Augustine, sent by
Pope Gregory the Great, who had purportedly seen young boys from
England and had called them “angels, not Angles.” Augustine entered
the kingdom of Kent, where the king was married to a Christian queen
from the continental kingdom of the Franks. The king, Aethelbert, converted to his wife’s faith, and Augustine went on to establish a monastery at Canterbury—the site of the first archbishopric, with Augustine
himself as archbishop. Other conversions in other kingdoms followed,
but initially these gains were offset by the rejection of Christianity in
several royal households

In fact, Christianity regained its influence in the former Britannia only owing to the enduring work of the Christians who had fled 
westward to Ireland when the Roman Empire collapsed. Ireland had
been dotted with monasteries since the fifth century, and it was the
Irish monks who effectively preserved and then spread Christianity
eastward through much of Britain, founding important monasteries in
the process. By the 630s, the southern kings were willing to listen with
new ears to the missionaries from these monasteries, and one king
after another embraced the faith of the Irish church. Before the end
of the seventh century, all of the kings of the British Isles were Christianized. As the ruler went, so also went his subjects. Monks traveled
throughout the countryside to spread the faith and to establish new
religious houses, for both monks and nuns, across the Isles.

The success of the Irish church posed serious problems for the Christian leaders in Rome, for the Irish ecclesiastics were organized differently and the Irish church calendar calculated differently than Rome’s.
The 664 Synod of Whitby was convened to address some of these
discrepancies and to impose conformity with the practices of Rome,
including the dates of church feasts and holy days and the appropriate style of the tonsure, the outward and visible sign of monasticism.
The allegiance to the new faith by English kings was crucial, especially because the tax assessments levied by the kings specifically for
the churches provided essential financial support. By the early eighth
century, many former Roman towns had been converted into sites for
cathedrals and monasteries, often with forts built by the Romans used
as the heart of these new religious communities and towns developing
outside the gates of the church complex proper.

England remained a loose conglomeration of individual kingdoms
throughout the 600s and 700s, but over time certain kingdoms gained
greater power than their neighbors, and their rulers functioned as
overkings to the entire region. The three main overkingdoms during
the eighth century were Mercia to the west (encompassing much of
Wales and the western Midlands of present-day England), Wessex
to the south, and Northumbria to the north. Of these three, Mercia
enjoyed the earliest supremacy, with kings Aethelbald (716–757) and
Offa (757–796) recognized as the undisputed rulers of the region. Offa
himself was regarded by Charlemagne as an equal counterpart to
the king of the Franks and was able to force Wessex to recognize his
overlordship after 782. But Mercian supremacy did not last. Dynastic battles and bloody uprisings characterized all three of the major
kingdoms. By 825 Offa’s successors had been forced to cede much of
Wessex back to the Wessex king, and by 830 much of Mercia had also
been compelled to recognize the overlordship of Ecgberht of Wessex.

VIKING INVASIONS AND THE DANE - LAW
Internal dynastic disputes paled in comparison with the wave
of Viking invasions that began in the 860s, however, as pirates and
then settlers from both Denmark and Norway spread across Western Europe and the British Isles. Population pressures at home and
awareness of English resources gathered from trade abroad fueled
the waves of incomers. Norwegian Vikings tended to settle mostly in the
west, in Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and Cornwall; Danish Vikings—the
word signified “pirate” and was applied with equal vehemence to
both groups of invaders—targeted the lands to the east. The Danish
Vikings faced the combined forces of Aethelred and Alfred, the grandsons of Ecgberht of Wessex, but despite initial resistance the Danish
armies appeared invincible.

Alfred, by 871 the king of Wessex, was able to forestall complete
disaster through a series of money payments to the Danes, and in 878
he earned his reputation as the king who saved Wessex and the Angles
generally by dealing a forceful blow to the Danish army. The Danish
leader and Alfred came to terms that limited Danish settlements to
the eastern half of England, an area known as the Dane-law that ran
from London northwards to York. Alfred, for his part, continued to
strengthen his Wessex kingdom, often by establishing fortresses that
soon attracted trade and commerce. Towns sprang up around these
defense strongholds. The marriage of Alfred’s daughter to Aethelred
of Mercia firmly and permanently joined Mercia and Wessex, further
consolidating the power of the English against that of the Danes and
leading Alfred to refer to himself as King of the Anglo-Saxons.

The Danes for their part had established their own society in the
Dane-law, with laws and religious practices that differed markedly
from those in Alfred’s England. When Alfred’s successors, Edward
the Elder, Athelstan, and Edmund, succeeded in reconquering and reChristianizing the Dane-law by the early 900s, they had to accommodate a number of distinctive legal and social practices introduced by
the Danish invaders. Alfred’s heirs were powerful enough to compel
the submission not only of the Danes but also of the kings of Scotland,
Wales, and the formerly independent kingdom of Northumbria. A 973
pageant marked the formal “submission” of eight kings in the Isles
to the overlordship of Eadgar, Edward’s grandson. This fealty by no
means precluded the consolidation of individual power under each of
these kings; the Scots were developing a strong separate kingdom that
remained relatively impervious to the influence of their Anglo-Saxon
neighbors, and Wales remained formally independent, although
bound by strong ties to the Wessex king

THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT
As the kings of Wessex gradually increased their kingdoms and
secured their powers, they began to refocus their attention away from
constant battle toward the establishment of systems of local government that would endure in peace. England was reorganized into a
system of shires, each under the control of a local magnate called an
ealdorman—later to be known as an earl. Each shire was further subdivided into portions generally called hundreds (referred to as “wapentake” in the Dane-law). Each hundred was itself split into 10 smaller
units or households, known as “tithings,” which were responsible
for local law enforcement and administration of the laws of king and
ealdorman. Within a generation, one of these administrators would
become known as the shire - reeve, or sheriff, an office that would
assume great power under Eadgar’s heirs.

Peace, however difficult to establish, contributed to the further
expansion of the monastic system throughout the kingdom. Monasteries and religious houses, particularly those under the Benedictine rule,
were supported by royal patronage and formed the basis for a scholastic life as rich in its way as the religious treasuries were in theirs. Religious officials, from archbishop to bishop to abbot, held positions as
royal advisors in the households of each of Alfred’s successors, and by
the time Eadgar was crowned in 973—at the same time during which
he received the fealty of the eight kings of the Isles—the focal point of
the coronation was the anointing of the ruler with holy oils. Indeed,
the coronation had been delayed until Eadgar reached his 30th birthday, the earliest age at which a man might become an ordained priest.
Thus the king had become nearly divine, an instrument of God on
earth, recognized as such through elaborate rituals and association
with the sacred.

NEW INVASIONS AND THE LAST OF THE
ANGLO-SAXON KINGS
Eadgar, that divinely royal king, died in 975 and left behind two
young sons. Within three years the heir, Edward (975–978), had been
murdered and replaced by Aethelred (978–1016), the younger son and
the man doomed to be known throughout history as “the Unready.”
Aethelred ruled until 1016 over a kingdom once more preyed on by
Viking invaders, this time by a powerful military machine led by
Swein, the king of a newly united Denmark and Norway. Heavy raids
began in 991 and continued even after Aethelred paid large sums to
forestall further invasion. The money itself only whetted the invaders’
appetites, and by 1002 Aethelred ordered the massacre of all Danes living on English lands, even in those areas of the Dane-law that were by
now peaceful regions of Aethelred’s expansive kingdom. Swein retaliated by leading an invasion in person in 1003, inaugurating a decade
of attack. By 1013, the residents of the Dane-law were ready to jettison
the king who had been unable to protect them, and within the year
Aethelred had been forced to flee to the continent, where he sought
the protection of the powerful Duke of Normandy, his father-in-law.
The house of Wessex had been defeated. In 1014 Swein’s younger son
Cnut (1014–1035, sometimes referred to as Canute) succeeded as king
of the Dane-law. By 1017 he was the recognized king of all of what
was now being referred to as England. He claimed both Denmark and
Norway as well by 1028, uniting the three kingdoms in the North Sea
Empire.

Cnut divided England into four separate earldoms—Northumbria,
East Anglia, Mercia, and Wessex—and replaced English earls with
Danish noblemen. One result was that a period of serious political
backbiting and intrigue followed Cnut’s death in 1035, ending only
with the coronation in 1043 of Edward (1043–1066), who would be
sainted as “the Confessor” for his piety. His ascension temporarily
restored the Wessex dynasty. Edward’s kingdom enjoyed efficient
local government, especially under the office of the sheriff. Edward’s
father, Aethelred, had already established a remarkably productive
system of local taxation, first to pay the Danes to forgo invasion and
then to support Cnut’s standing army. Edward used both of these
tools, government and taxation, to great effect. He also continued his
grandfather’s emphasis on the sanctity of the king, further emphasizing the holy nature of his secular office by surrounding himself with
clerks and advisors chosen from monastic houses. One of these clerical
positions would evolve into the office of the royal chancellor. And he
began the construction of a new abbey that would become Westminster Abbey.

Edward presided over a kingdom that boasted a rapidly growing
population, an increasingly complex system of agriculture, and a vast
increase in new towns and urban centers that supported not only local
markets but also the guilds that sprang up to organize craftsmen and
artisans. In the countryside small churches began to supplement the
work of the cathedrals and monasteries, often built under the direction
of the local aristocrat who wanted a priest to serve his extensive household and his tenantry. There was no parish system in the modern
sense, but the foundation was laid as nobles exercised increasing local
power, defining themselves no longer solely by military prowess but
now, in a time of relative peace, by effective local administration. Military obligations were not forgotten, however; the foundations of the
feudal system, with lords responsible for providing men and matériel
for their overlords, were laid in Edward’s lengthy reign.

By the 1050s it was clear that Edward would die childless. Many
feared that the Norwegian kings would attempt another invasion to
reclaim the throne that had been Cnut’s. One of the four earls, Godwine of Wessex, mounted an unsuccessful coup that illustrated the
problems that awaited any new king. Godwine’s two sons, Harold
and Tostig, had already inherited the earldoms of Wessex and Northumbria, together wielding tremendous power and appearing to be the
logical choices as Edward’s successors. The brothers fell out, however,
and when Edward died in 1066 they were sworn enemies, rivals for
the throne that Edward had left to Harold, who reigned from January
through October that year. The resultant battles provided the opportunity for an illegitimate descendant of the Normans, William, to muster his own forces and to invade. William claimed that Harold had
secretly agreed to support William’s claims to the throne instead of
his own, and the overall sense of chaos was increased with the assertion of claims by the king of Norway and by Harold’s brother Tostig.
Harold himself defeated these two claimants and then met William on
a hill near Hastings, on English soil, as sworn rivals for the kingship of
England. Harold’s death gave William the impetus he needed to
advance on London, and he moved troops toward the city, leaving
destruction in his wake. His triumph was complete when he received
the fealty of the nobles of England. The Anglo-Saxon royal dynasties
were gone. The Normans, allied with the English royal family only by
marriage and not by blood, were the last invaders to conquer the Isles.

Medieval Britain

THE NORMAN KINGS: CONFLICTED ALLEGIANCES
AND COMPETING CLAIMS
The consecration of William (1066–1087), a ceremony signifying his
position as both secular and divine leader, took place amid chaos. His
Norman guards, alarmed by the shouts of his supporters, set fire to
the houses near Westminster Abbey to deter William’s enemies. The
resultant disaster nearly cut short the ceremony before the holy oils
could be applied. Was this a message that William’s hold on England
was in jeopardy?

William certainly acted to consolidate his power as quickly as possible, doing so at the expense of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy. The first
five years of his reign witnessed continual rebellion and opposition,
put down by force. Lands confiscated by the new king were given to
the Norman aristocracy in exchange for money, military service, and
attestations of loyalty. The system of feudal relations that had begun
under the Anglo-Saxon kings and the range of feudal dues paid by
vassals to their overlords were strengthened and enlarged through a
sophisticated bureaucratic apparatus designed to ensure that money
and power remained under the new king’s control. An army of 
educated priests—clerics—continued to fill the positions of clerks in
the royal household, also acting in many instances as the king’s advisors and superintending many of the bureaucratic functions of the
kingdom. The innovations of feudalism revolved around male power,
with women’s roles becoming more sharply defined and frequently,
especially for noble women, more constrained. The emergence of
courtly literature that glorified chivalric codes reinforced notions of
ideal womanhood among the elite, although the reality of women’s
lives even in the noble class was often harsh and even brutal.

The feudal organization of society, with military service, feudal
dues, and loyalty moving upward from vassal to crown and honors
and protection moving downward from crown to vassal, rested on the
organization of the land itself into a system referred to as manorialism.
The organization of land into parcels called manors, which had begun
in the Anglo-Saxon period, gradually became the norm, both in law
and in practice: the crown granted manors to his vassals, who in turn
could subdivide them and lease them to tenants through a variety of
methods, ranging from freehold (inheritable in perpetuity) and copyhold (held and inherited for a space of time measured by the lives of
the tenants, with three lives becoming the most common) to leasehold
(held through a lease granted for a term of years). Much of this was
organized under the umbrella of primogeniture, the practice of leaving estates to the eldest male heir in order to make sure they remained
whole and therefore powerful. Peasants were required to work for the
lord of the manor in a system that was legally codified into serfdom,
wherein they were bound to the land; serfs were not slaves, in that
they could not be bought and sold, but they were the unfree labor on
which the manorial system rested. Serfdom persisted through the 15th
century in England and Wales, although it was obsolete in Scotland at
least a century earlier. All of these innovations and more were recorded
in what is perhaps the most famous artifact of William’s bureaucracy,
the Domesday survey, commissioned in 1086. The survey resulted in
the Great and Little Domesday books, in which such information as
acreage, titles, rents, livestock, and labor were recorded for each estate
and manor in England. Not only did this survey provide a snapshot
of England in the late 11th century, but it also served as an important
resource for generations to come for setting levels of taxation, collecting feudal dues, and settling land disputes.

Within a generation of William’s accession, England had become a
virtual extension of Normandy, with Norman nobility and French language and culture joined by a continental contempt for the “barbaric”
Celtic cultures of the Welsh and Scots, whose lands remained outside
of William’s control. Even continental architecture supplanted AngloSaxon in the churches and cathedrals that were built and rebuilt after
the conquest. But strong ties to Normandy would ultimately cause
long-term issues of conflicted allegiance for William’s heirs. William
himself, as both king of England and Duke of Normandy, owed
homage only to the king of France. His Norman nobility, for their
part, owed fealty to him both as Duke of Normandy and as king of
England. When those roles were separated, as they soon would be,
the aristocracy with ties to both England and the continent would face
challenges to its loyalty.

This problem emerged almost immediately after William’s consecration and even more strongly after his death, as the ducal title of
Normandy and the conquered crown of England were inherited by
two sons, Robert (Duke of Normandy) and William Rufus (king of
England, 1087–1100). Tensions were temporarily resolved when in
1096 Robert gave the duchy over to the custody of William Rufus while
he himself joined the Crusades, in exchange for a large payment from
his brother. William Rufus now held both titles, simplifying the questions of allegiance among his aristocracy. As king of England, William
Rufus was a marked contrast to the pious ruler his father had been. He
tended to delay filling empty positions in the church hierarchy as long
as possible—he waited years to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury, for instance—preferring to enjoy these incomes for himself. At
the same time, on the continent, the pope was asserting new authority
over prelates in every kingdom, and many English ecclesiasts found
it simplest to place loyalty to the pope well above loyalty to a worldly
and licentious king who refused even to marry and fulfill his duty to
secure a peaceful succession.

When William Rufus died in 1100 in a hunting accident, he left no
heir. Robert, returning from the Crusades, was expected to claim not
only his own duchy but also his brother’s English holdings. But a
third brother, Henry, was more nimble, claiming the English crown as
Henry I (1100–1135) just before Robert’s return. The renewed problem
of conflicting allegiances for those with lands in both England and
Normandy was once again temporarily resolved on a practical level
when Robert was captured by Henry’s men in 1106 and imprisoned
until his death in 1134.

FAMILY QUARRELS AND CIVIL WAR
Despite Henry’s efforts at forging alliances, both to secure his
English throne and to protect his duchy of Normandy, he was unable 
to arrange a peaceful succession. After the death of his son in 1120, he
married a second wife but within a few years was forced to face the
fact that there would be no legitimate male heirs. In 1125, therefore,
he called a meeting of his nobles, directing them to formally acknowledge his daughter Matilda, his only remaining legitimate child, as
his rightful heir. Matilda, the young widow of Holy Roman Emperor
Henry V, was rapidly married off to Geoffrey Plantagenet, the heir to
the powerful duchy of Anjou, in order to link both Normandy and
England to Anjou. Henry soon quarreled with Matilda and Geoffrey,
however, forcing his nobles to choose between loyalty to England and
loyalty to the Angevins. When Henry died in 1135, the two factions
were pitted against one another. Henry’s supporters transferred their
allegiance to his nephew Stephen (1135–1154), who beat his cousins
to London and was crowned and anointed king just before Christmas
in 1135; he secured the loyalty of those who had promised to support
Matilda by arguing that the 1125 oath had been sworn under duress.
Powerful Norman magnates, who had estates on both sides of the
channel, generally agreed that supporting Stephen was the best way
to protect their own extensive interests. Matilda, who used the title
Dowager Empress, and Geoffrey established a rival court, but Stephen
was able to maintain his hold on power until his capture by opposition
forces in 1141.

Now the throne was claimed both by Stephen’s cousin, Empress
Matilda (sometimes referred to as Maud), and by his wife, Queen
Matilda, who eventually secured Stephen’s release. A low-level civil
war ensued, definitively ending in 1153 only when Stephen was able
to secure a negotiated peace with Henry, the son and heir of Empress
Matilda and Geoffrey. Henry had inherited both Anjou and Normandy on his father’s death in 1151 and gained the province of Aquitaine through his marriage in 1152 to Eleanor, the ex-wife of French
king Louis VII, making him a formidable opponent or an equally formidable ally. Stephen adopted Henry as his heir in 1153 and died the
following year, making way for what would eventually be labeled
the Plantagenet dynasty, so called after Geoffrey’s habit of wearing a
sprig of broom shrub (Latin name planta genista) in his hat.

Henry II’s (1154–1189) empire was enormous. He continued to owe
allegiance to the king of France, but his riches far exceeded those of
his overlord. England was merely one piece of a much larger pie that
included Anjou, Maine, Normandy, Aquitaine, Nantes, and Brittany
on the continent, and it was in no way the most pressing of Henry’s
priorities. Within the Isles, he regained certain portions of northern
England that had been taken over by the Scots king, negotiated a 
peace of sorts with the dynastic families of Wales, and in 1169 began
his project of conquering Ireland. The Irish invasion was funded in
part by the pope, who saw Henry as a necessary tool in the reform of
the Irish church, where the practices of Catholicism continued to differ
significantly from the orthodoxy dictated by Rome. It took more than
a century, but by the 1290s, much of Ireland had been brought temporarily under direct English control, with English institutions of law
and commerce joined to, and often swamping, those of the Irish kings.

But business on the continent was always more immediate for
Henry than business in the Isles, and he was generally content to leave
the day-to-day oversight of his English kingdom to his bureaucracy,
spending some two-thirds of his own time in his French holdings.
England gained his personal attention only rarely, as, for instance,
when his friend Thomas Becket, whom he had elevated to the archbishopric of Canterbury, defied the king in the matter of criminal
behavior by priestly clerks. Henry demanded that all felons, including
these clerks, be tried in the king’s courts; Becket argued that such men
continue to be tried in ecclesiastical courts, which ran on an entirely
separate track independent from the secular system, and where erring
clerics were often spared any punishment. Becket fled to France in
1164 after being convicted of contempt and malfeasance but returned
in 1170 and was murdered by Henry’s men in the sanctuary of his
own cathedral, after a casual remark by an enraged king. This episode,
although securing Becket’s canonization, had little effect on Henry’s
reputation as king, and he continued to enjoy tremendous power.

Henry was not so lucky in his family of four sons, who were early at
one another’s throats as each sought the largest part of Henry’s broad
dominions. Henry parceled out the land but retained the real power
for himself, and rebellion was a chronic accompaniment to the king’s
later years. Two of his sons died, and his preference for his youngest
and least-able son John led Richard, the other survivor, to seek the
help of the king of France to secure his own inheritance. Richard was
successful; on Henry’s death in 1189, he inherited not only England
as Richard I “The Lionheart” (1189–1199) but also Anjou, Normandy,
and Aquitaine. Ireland went to John and Brittany to a grandson. This
enormous realm required enormous bureaucracies. The household of
the king had increased dramatically under Henry, and under Richard
these administrators were even more necessary: Richard left on a Crusade to Jerusalem in 1190 and lay captive for months, even as his men
thwarted a rebellion by his brother John. Like his father, Richard spent
most of his time on the continent, regarding England as a lesser part
of his kingdom.

Richard died in 1199 without heirs, and both Normandy and
England went to his brother John, the Lord of Ireland. For four years
John (1199–1216) spent most of his time on the continent, offending
almost everyone and losing many of his continental holdings through
his shabby treatment of his vassal lords. By the end of 1203 he was
forced to retreat back across the Channel, where he focused his attention on quarreling with his English nobles and his English church and
enforcing unprecedentedly high levels of taxation. Rebellion in 1214–
1215 forced John to accept a statement of liberties and a clarification
of the mutual obligations and duties within the feudal system, which
became known as the Magna Carta, or Great Charter.

John had no intention of adhering to the charter, however; it was a
delaying tactic while he gathered forces to fight in the civil war that
broke out in earnest in September 1215. When John died, 13 months
later, the two sides were at odds over the heir to the throne: should it
be John’s young son, Henry, whose minority would guarantee a ruling council and could well open the doors to corruption and disaster,
or should it be Louis, a princeling of France, whose ties to the kingdom were thin at best? A series of battles led to a treaty under which
Louis gave up his claims to the throne, and nine-year-old Henry was
proclaimed Henry III (1216–1272). He ruled on his own only after
1232, but the council ruling in his behalf carefully avoided many of
the pitfalls of minority kingships, and when Henry began to wield
power independently, he did so in a setting where the king’s continental holdings were considered increasingly less important than his
kingdom of England. English king and lords were English first, Norman second. After 1259, this reorientation was reinforced as Henry’s
French holdings were reduced by treaty to a tiny proportion of those
lands once held by his grandfathers.

TAXATION, REPRESENTATION, AND RELIGION
The maintenance of a kingdom on two continents was costly, and the
early medieval kings proved remarkably resourceful at finding new
ways to raise money from their subjects. In addition to the potentially
extravagant income that could be realized through the use of patronage and the manipulation of feudal dues—something that Edward
I and II would take to an extreme level—these kings began to experiment with direct taxes based on moveable goods as well as land. Customs duties also became a fixed part of the Crown income during this
period. The English church was supported as well through a new
body of taxes, many of which were first levied to pay for the Crusades 
but which were quickly made a regular part of church finance. Papal
authority demanded these taxes, but the popes also clearly saw that
the judicious assignment of this income directly to the English church
would strengthen the ties between Rome and England.

All of these new taxes had to be collected. Collection of land and
property taxes required the direct cooperation of the landowning
nobility, the magnates; collection of customs duties required the cooperation of the merchants of the towns. Thus it was that kings began to
summon the men of the shires, chosen by their peers to represent them
in these important matters, to parlay—to discuss the nature of taxes
and the reasons for new levies. These discussions, or parliaments,
inaugurated the necessary relationship between consultation with the
substantial men of the kingdom, on the one hand, and the collection
of taxes, on the other. The great nobility had always had access to the
king’s ear. It was the need to include lesser men in this conversation
that began the move to an established and formal parliament with two
separate houses. Thus, the knights who had formerly been completely
attached to their overlord’s households were given new responsibilities beyond their traditional military functions. By the 1100s, knights
were becoming landed gentry, beginning the transformation into a
class that would bear the responsibility for ensuring that the king’s
laws were enforced even far away from the king himself. The dispensation of justice in turn more and more relied on jury trials presided
over by traveling circuit judges, rather than on the traditional trial by
sword, for nobility, and trial by ordeal of fire or water, for others less
fortunate.

The medieval English church remained firmly tied to the church at
Rome, even with the development of church taxes that were levied
almost solely for the use of the English church. In 1066, there were
approximately 50 religious houses in England; 150 years later, there
were 700, including orders for women. Joining the traditional orders
of monks and nuns were mendicant friars, who crossed parish boundaries to minister to men and women across the land, administering
sacraments especially in the new towns that sprang up as population
pressures increased. Pilgrimages to religious sites became a common
practice, and even the smallest churches claimed significance through
the variety of relics they preserved. (Nineteenth-century American
author Mark Twain would say of his own European tours that he had
seen enough splinters of the True Cross to shingle a barn.) England’s
few Jews would be formally expelled in 1290 under Edward I, not
to return until the 1650s. They had already been subject to increasing persecution: herded into Jewries and forced to wear identifying
badges, accused of ritual murder of children, and slaughtered in large
numbers in York and London.


EDWARD I AND II: RELATIONS WITH WALES,
SCOTLAND, AND IRELAND
Like his father Henry, Edward I (1272–1307) spent a great deal of time
in his French lands, especially the profitable wine - making region of
Gascony, after his succession. Within Britain, however, his attention
was focused on Wales, where the conquest of the Welsh kings proved
relatively rapid for one of Edward’s wealth. Wales had been the haven
of Anglo-Saxons fleeing the Norman invasion, just as it had been a
retreat for the Celtic tribes menaced by Anglo-Saxons. After 1066,
Welsh princes had, in theory, gradually acknowledged the overlordship of the English king, but in practice they had continued to rule
their lands as though the Norman kings were far distant neighbors.
In 1267 Henry III had granted Llywelyn ap Gruffydd the hereditary
title of Prince of Wales, formally recognizing him as the leader of all
the Welsh dynasties in the newly created principality of Wales. But his
son Edward I, with many fewer continental distractions consuming
his time and his money, was determined to conquer Wales for his own
use. Llywelyn ap Gruffydd was ambushed in 1282, and by 1284 the
conquest of the principality was complete. The territory was divided
into four shires, modeled after English shires. Edward allowed the
continuation of some Welsh laws and customs but only when they did
not significantly clash with the common law of England. Administration of the marches, the borderlands between England and Wales, was
given into the hands of large lordships known as the Marcher lordships. These Marcher Lords, members of powerful Norman families,
ruled according to their own laws rather than the laws of the king and
established administrative bureaucracies and castles to rival those of
the English crown. This autonomy would end only under the reign of
Henry VIII, with the passage of two Laws in Wales Acts in 1535 and 1542.

Edward was also hungry to consolidate control over the lands
to his north. But Scotland had a single and remarkably stable royal
family, blessed with a series of exceptionally long-lived kings in the
House of Dunkeld, and an independent Scottish church recognized
as such by the pope. Indeed, Scotland occasionally ventured south
to acquire its own new territory: Northumbria lay in Scottish hands
for two decades, and the Scottish kings forged strong relationships
with other kingdoms on the European continent, especially France.

Despite his reputation as “the hammer of the north,” Edward’s hunger
for northern expansion remained unsated. His efforts instead helped
touch off the Anglo-Scottish Wars, also known as the Scottish Wars
of Independence (1296–1357). War began after King John of Scotland
(crowned 1296; abdicated 1296) declared allegiance to Edward but
simultaneously conducted secret negotiations with France, leading
Edward to invade. Edward was gradually able to assert control and to
gain the allegiance of many Scottish lords but met with strong resistance under the leadership of the famous William Wallace, who eluded
English control until his capture and execution for treason in 1305.
After Wallace’s death, Scottish lord Robert the Bruce rescinded his
own allegiance to Edward and instead claimed the throne as Robert
I in 1306, consolidating his power and defeating rivals to the Scottish
crown.
