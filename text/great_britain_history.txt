Britain has always meant more than “England,” although for many
English and for many outside England this meaning has been allowed
for centuries to assume a role of singular importance. At one time or
another in history, 

Britain has incorporated:
    - England,
    - Wales,
    - Scotland,
    - Ireland,
    - the smaller islands surrounding these larger isles,
    - parts of what is now France,
    - great chunks of North and South America,
    - large portions of both Africa and Asia, and the whole of Australasia. 

Britain has also, by choice or by compulsion, divested itself of many of these
holdings but has left indelible traces of British culture behind.


Perhaps the best place to start is with a quick geographical primer.

    - England (capital London),
    - Scotland (capital Edinburgh),
    - Wales (capital Cardiff) 
    - are all part of the contemporary entity known as Great Britain.
    
    All three of these, along with Northern Ireland, are part
of the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” or
United Kingdom = UK

    Very often, the United Kingdom is also referred to
as simply “Britain,” and today “British” is often held to describe and
refer to the entire United Kingdom.

The entirety of Ireland was part
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from the 1801 Act
of Union through 1921, when it was divided by the Anglo - Irish Treaty
into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland.

The Irish Free State changed its name to Éire in 1937 before becoming
the Republic of Ireland in 1948. It includes the 26 southern counties of the former larger
Ireland, and its capital is Dublin.

Northern Ireland, which remains
part of the United Kingdom, is made up of the six northeastern counties, including Ulster, and its capital is Belfast

Within the geographical perimeter of the British Isles, the Channel
Islands (Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, and several smaller islands),
and the Isle of Man are crown dependencies, self-governing possessions of the Crown, which are overseen by lieutenant governors but
with relative autonomy. They are not included in the formal United
Kingdom, nor are they members of the Commonwealth of Nations or
the European Union. The Shetland and Orkney Isles, by contrast, are
counties of Scotland, and Anglesey is a county of Wales.

But Britain is not and has never been limited to these areas. The British Empire at its peak spanned the globe, and in the years after World
War I, as it began to be dismantled, commonwealth status replaced
colonial status for much of the empire. The British Commonwealth of
Nations was formally established in 1931 to include the white-settled
dominions that had been self-governing for decades:
    - Canada,
    - Newfoundland,
    - Australia,
    - New Zealand,
    - South Africa,
    - the Irish Free State.
    
    As decolonization progressed in the years after World War II,
commonwealth status was granted to those new nations that chose
to belong. Today, the Commonwealth embraces 52 nations, most of
which are former British colonies or have some strong relationship
with a former colony (e.g., Samoa and New Zealand). These members
recognize the British monarch as the symbolic head of the organization
but share little else except a common history of British rule. Membership is voluntary, but applications for membership must be approved
by the Commonwealth Heads of Government.

The British Isles themselves are, especially to Americans, quite
small. Their entire area—93,000 square miles for the United Kingdom
and 27,135 square miles for the Republic of Ireland—is only slightly
larger than New England. Yet within this small area, there is great geographic diversity, from the moors of Devon and the fens, or swamps,
of the southeast to the highlands and lowlands of Scotland. The climate is tempered by the effects of Atlantic currents, so that while the
varieties of weather include snow and heat, extremes of temperature
or precipitation are rare. Certain areas, such as Scotland and Wales,
receive some 200 days of rain a year, although most of England and
Ireland is less perpetually soggy.

ETHNICITY AND CULTURE, CLASS, AND RELIGION
The 2017 announcement of the engagement of Prince Harry, at the
time fifth in line to the throne, to actress Meghan Markle — American,
divorced, biracial — opened a new chapter of gossipy interest in “the
royals” as it also challenged the cultural attitudes of many in the
United Kingdom. Much of the negative press surrounding the engagement reflected deep racial and social antagonisms that have surfaced
as the country has aged and become increasingly diverse.


Census figures for 2011 placed the overall UK population at 63.2 million (an increase of some 7% since 2001), with 53 million people in
England, 5.3 million in Scotland, 3.1 million in Wales, and 1.8 million
in Northern Ireland. The robust growth in population comes not only
from longer life expectancies (especially for aging baby boomers) and
higher birth rates but also from net migration (the numbers of immigrants minus the numbers of emigrants), which has risen steadily since
2012. This growth rate is about twice the growth rate for the European
Union as a whole (0.53% vs. 0.25%).1 Brexit will undoubtedly modify
this growth trend, as most of the increase in immigration has come
from working-age men and women from EU countries.

This growing population is aging. Of the 63 million inhabitants of
the United Kingdom noted in 2011, 18 percent are below 16 years of
age, 66 percent are between 16 and 64 years, and 16 percent are above
65 years.2 (In 2001, these figures were 20%, 59%, and 21%, respectively.) The population is also changing in terms of ethnicity and culture. While the population of Northern Ireland is mostly white, the
numbers of those in the rest of the United Kingdom who claim mixed
and nonwhite ethnicity have grown considerably since 1980. Census
figures from 2011 indicate that 86 percent claim white ethnicity, a
decrease from 94 percent in 2001. Of the 13 percent born outside the
United Kingdom, one-third emigrated from Europe (primarily from
EU member countries), another third from the Middle East or Asia
(primarily Iraq or Iran), and one-fifth from Africa (primarily Egypt or
South Africa). Religious affiliations among those arriving since 2001
indicate that the largest numbers of immigrants identify as Buddhist,
Christian, Muslim, or “no religion.” These rapid changes in ethnicity and cultural background have affected especially cities and towns,
and it is not surprising that the strongest push for Brexit has come from
areas outside London, as suburban and rural voters with little daily
exposure to immigrants were the prime demographic in favor of leaving the EU. (Voters in London and in Scotland, Wales, and Northern
Ireland voted overwhelmingly to remain, for reasons we will explore
at the end of this volume.)


The rapid influx of immigrants over the past 20 years has inevitably placed great burdens on infrastructure even while these men and
women have helped strengthen the overall economy. They also, inevitably, have helped reshape a British culture that has always included
elements of empire, from the late 19th-century craze for all things
Egyptian to the 20th-century Jamaican influence on popular music.
Anti-immigrant sentiment has been an unfortunate part of British
culture for the past two centuries, focusing on obvious differences in
religion, race, and cultural habits and worsening at times of economic
stagnation—ranging from the Irish potato famine of the 1840s to the
period beginning with the Cold War. As we will see in Chapter 12, the
influence of modern anti-immigrant propaganda ties into what some
observers have called the “order/openness” divide among voters,
resulting in a tendency to conflate particular forms of white nationalism with perceptions of safety, on the one hand, and cultural heterogeneity with perceptions of chaos and danger, on the other.

These ethnic differences—significant enough to attract the attention of social critics, artists, and politicians beginning in the mid-19th
century—have tended to complicate rather than to erase Britain’s
traditionally very strong class divisions. In areas where there are
fewer issues of race, class alone remains as divisive as it was at the
height of the 19th century. Former deputy prime minister John L.
Prescott, who was born into a Welsh working-class family, is said to
have proclaimed in 1997 that “we’re all middle class now,”3 but this
middle class continues to be subdivided in ways that reflect not only
income but also consumer preferences, education, vocabulary, and
technological savvy. Markers of class still include accent, although
this has been complicated by the deliberate adoption of down-scale
pronunciation by those rejecting “received pronunciation” or “BBC
English,” beginning in the 1970s. They also include leisure preferences, although this too has been complicated with the enthusiastic
embrace of soap operas rooted not just in the working classes (e.g.,
the long-running Coronation Street and EastEnders) but also in the
stratified middle classes portrayed in Made in Chelsea and The Only
Way Is Essex. Even a preference for football (U.S. soccer), traditionally
the most quintessential of working-class leisure pursuits, has crossed
class lines, largely because tickets to live events have become prohibitively expensive.

While divisions between and among middle and working classes
have been increasingly inflected by ethnicity and race, the upper class 
has remained relatively homogeneous. The continued existence of a
hereditary aristocracy is a source of endless fascination for Americans
and often for the British as well. It is outlined in all of its complexity
in both the annual Debrett’s Peerage and the less-frequent Burke’s Peerage. The highest rank within the peerage is duke or duchess, a title limited to the royal family. Dukes are territorial titles; that is, one is a Duke
of Northumberland because the family territory is in Northumberland.
Other titles often incorporate the family name rather than the territory. The highest rank held by an individual outside the royal family is
marquess (sometimes “marquis”) or marchioness. This is followed in
descending order by earl / countess, viscount / viscountess, and baron /
baroness. At the bottom of the ladder of hereditary titles is that of baronet, which is, essentially, an inherited form of knighthood reserved
to men (only four women have carried the title of baronetess in British
history). Knighthood itself is an honor conferred by the Crown on men
and women to recognize service in various ways, ranging from traditional military service to popularity in the theater or sport, and is for
life only. Neither baronets nor knights are peers; that is, they remain
commoners and may not be included in the House of Lords. Baronetcies pass to male heirs, but knighthood is not inheritable.

In addition to the hereditary peers are the life peers, recognized as
such for achievement or service to the country, who usually hold the
title of baron or baroness. The late prime minister Margaret Thatcher,
for example, was given the rank of baroness on retirement, enabling
her to sit in the House of Lords, and was called “Lady Margaret
Thatcher” until her death. The actor Lawrence Olivier was similarly
honored in 1970 as “Baron Olivier.” Life peers hold titles that cannot
be inherited, although their children may adopt “The Honourable” as
part of their own styling.

Children of hereditary peers may accumulate a number of titles on
their own but will always be referred to by their highest honor, which
will change when they inherit new titles on the death of a parent.
Thus, if the Duke of Bedford dies, his son, the Marquess of Tavistock,
automatically becomes the new Duke of Bedford and is subsequently
referred to as such. The same holds true when any individual is
granted a new title; for example, when Benjamin Disraeli, the (untitled) 19th-century prime minister, was made the Earl of Beaconsfield
(a title that died with him) by Queen Victoria, he was “Disraeli” until
1876 and “Beaconsfield” thereafter. Similarly, the 18th-century man of
letters Horace Walpole became the Earl of Orford (a hereditary title)
in 1742 and was known subsequently as “Orford” in official records
and correspondence

Since the 1950s, many politically minded children of hereditary
peers have renounced their titles, primarily because the inheritance of
a peerage means immediate translation from the House of Commons,
where political power is considerable, to the House of Lords, where it
is not. Thus, for instance, the Labour politician Anthony Wedgewood
Benn fought for the right to renounce the title of Viscount Stansgate
and was known simply as “Tony Benn” until his death in 2014. Benn’s
actions in 1960 led to the 1963 Peerage Act that provided for the renunciation of “unwanted” titles by members of the House of Lords

The Church of England is as complicated as the peerage. Also
known as the Anglican Church, it is the traditional established, or
state, religion of England. The Church has successfully fought several
battles against disestablishment, the formal removal from its position
as a part of the state. Until 1920, the Anglican Church was also the
established, or state, church of Wales, but it was disestablished as the
state church of Wales that year; as the Church of Wales, it remains part
of the Anglican Communion. In Scotland, the state church is the Kirk,
which is Presbyterian. In Northern Ireland, there is no state church,
but most of the 66 percent Protestant majority are either Presbyterian
or Church of Ireland (Anglican).

Within the Anglican Church in England, the highest authority
resides in the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose province now has 30
dioceses; his counterpart, the Archbishop of York, presides over 12.
Each diocese is in turn presided over by a bishop within a cathedral.
The first female Church of England Bishop was consecrated in January 2015. Below the bishop in each diocese are the archdeacon and the
dean. Administratively, the Church of England is divided into parishes, each with its own church. Until the New Poor Law of 1834, one
of the most important functions of each parish, in addition to religious
care, was the care of the poor within its geographical boundaries. The
priest of the church is referred to as the rector or the vicar.


Despite the persistence of an established state church (Anglican or
Presbyterian), the United Kingdom shares with other Western countries a gradual but significant decline in Christian religious practice.
The 2011 census returns indicated that nearly 60 percent of respondents
in England and Wales considered themselves Christian, down from
nearly 72 percent in 2001; the next largest affiliation was Muslim (4.8%,
up from 3.0% in 2001). About 25 percent indicated “no religion,” up
from 14.8 percent in 2001. In 2011, slightly more than 2 percent indicated Hindu, Buddhist, Judaism, or Sikh; approximately 0.5 percent
indicated “other,” which included both established groups such as Jain
and less traditional groups such as Jedi or “heavy metal.”4 In Scotland,
the 2011 census indicated that 54 percent of the population claimed affiliation with some form of Christianity (down from 65% in 2001), while
37 percent indicated “no religion” (up from 9% in 2001);5 1.4 percent
identified as Muslim in 2011, up from 0.09 percent in 2001.6 Surveys of
actual practice, rather than formal affiliation, indicate that attendance
at most established Christian churches has dropped precipitously over
the past several decades, with nearly half of members reporting that
they do not attend services regularly.7 As we will see in later chapters,
the changing nature of religious belief in the United Kingdom has had
significant impact on local, national, and imperial identities.

GOVERNMENT
Britain is a constitutional monarchy where most power now resides
in the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament. This was
not always the case. The shift from “crown” to “crown-in-parliament”
took many decades, a regicide, several civil wars, and an abdication.
Today the queen, Elizabeth II, is a figurehead. However, for many her
symbolic functions are crucial to the “Britishness” of Britain. Ongoing arguments over the wealth and responsibilities of the royal family
erupt periodically in calls for the abolition of the Crown. The personal
disasters of many of Elizabeth’s children—especially the public life
and early death of Diana, the first wife of the current prince of Wales,
which provided ample for journalists—have led some to argue
that the royal family is more burden than boon. When a fire gutted
part of Windsor Castle in 1992, the year Elizabeth herself referred to as
an annus horribilis, the question of who should pay for the $62 million
in repairs highlighted the larger question of whether the monarchy
was anything more than a drain on the economy. Yet in 2002, when
Elizabeth celebrated her Golden Jubilee, much of the British public
warmly congratulated the queen on the 50 years of her reign. By the
time Prince William, second in line to the throne, married Catherine
Middleton in 2011, public sentiment was overwhelmingly positive for
“Will and Kate.” Even the most cynical observers now doubt that the
monarchy will be abolished anytime soon and are resigned to the continuation of a symbolic Crown that still wields important emotional 
and persuasive powers. Indeed, the popularity of the multi-season
dramas The Crown, portraying the reign of Elizabeth II, and Victoria,
testifies to the continued fascination of the royal family past and present, both in the United Kingdom and abroad.

Real political power is vested in the House of Commons, the lower
house that along with the House of Lords constitutes the British
Parliament, which sits in the borough of Westminster in London. Most
political and government offices are located on Whitehall Street, many
of them in Whitehall Palace. As a result, the government itself is often
referred to as “Whitehall.” In this text, “Westminster” refers to the
Parliament, and “Whitehall” refers to the ministries of the Crown.

A series of reform bills in the 19th and early 20th centuries extended
the franchise to the entire adult population. Some 66 percent of voters participated in the 2015 general election.8 Parliament is in session
annually. The 2011 Fixed Term Parliament Act mandates a general
election every five years, on the first Thursday of May. Under certain circumstances—a motion from within the House of Commons
with two-thirds support, or a vote of “no confidence” in the existing
government—a general election can be called before the five-year
period is up. So-called by-elections are held in individual districts if
an MP (member of Parliament) dies or retires within that five-year
period. A total of 650 MPs represent the United Kingdom: in 2017,
there were 442 men and 208 women returned as MPs. Of that total, 19
represent Northern Ireland, 59 represent Scotland, and 40 represent
Wales. In addition, there are “devolved” governments for Northern
Ireland (the Northern Ireland Executive), Scotland (the Scottish Executive), and Wales (the Welsh Assembly Government). Created in 1998
after local referenda, each of these devolved governments sits regularly to consider subjects not explicitly reserved to the UK Parliament,
including health, education, justice, and agriculture. Each has its own
first or prime minister and a cabinet of ministers

Although there are several smaller parties, the parliament in Westminster is essentially a two-party system. Today these parties are the
Conservatives, occasionally still referred to as the Tories, and Labour.
Since 1945 the control of government has been in the hands of one or
the other of those parties without much input from the smaller parties,
which include the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Nationalist Party,
Plaid Cymru (the Welsh Independence Party), the UK Independence
Party (which spearheaded Brexit), and the Green Party. Coalition government is common on the continent, but it is and has always been
singularly absent in England, although it is much more the norm in
the devolved governments of Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
