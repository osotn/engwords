You are working hard today. Yes,
I have a lot to do.
The company  I work for isn't
doing so well in this year.
We use the present continuous
when we talk about changes
happening around now,
especially with verbs...
Is your english getting better?
At first  I didn't like my job,
but I am beginning to enjoy it
now.
