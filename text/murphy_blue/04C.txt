We normally use the present simple (not  continuous) with see/hear/smell/taste:
Do you see that man over there? Do you recognise him?
This room smells.
Let's open a window.
We also use can + see/hear/smell/taste:
I can hear a strange noise. Can you hear it?
You can use the simple or continuous to say how something looks or feels now:
You look well today. You are looking well today.
How do you feel now? How are you feeling now?
But I usually feel tired in the morning.
