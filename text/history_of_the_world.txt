BEGINNINGS

History is a word which traditionally means two different things: what
happened, and a true account of what happened. In the second sense, it is
always a selection from the past. Even the history of the whole world,
though, is not a selection from all the past. We can ignore most of Time. We
need not go back to the ' Big Bang ' from which our universe emerged in
order to understand where we are now. History is the story of human
beings, and it is the human past which concerns us. Even when historians
look at things beyond human control, such as geography, climate and, for
immense tracts of time, disease, they do so only because that helps to
explain why men and women lived and died in some ways rather than
others. Or, to put it another way, history in the first sense - what happened
- is what happened to and has been done by humans.

This cuts down the past we have to deal with by quite a lot, but still
leaves an enormous amount to be tackled. Nor does it make it very clear
where we are to begin. In theory, it could be with the first human being.
But we do not know when or where he or she appeared, even if we can
make responsible guesses within fairly broad limits. And, to make things
more difficult, not everyone agrees about what sort of creatures in early
times might be thought of as ' human '; and where the line between them
and other animals is crossed.

A clear line is very hard to draw. People do not now talk (as they once
did) about ' ape - men ' and ' missing links '. Physiology helps us to classify
data but what we call ' human ' is still a matter of a definition and disagreement
is possible. What is surely and identifiably unique about humans is
not just their possession of certain characteristics, but what they do with
them. What human beings have always shown is a cumulative capacity
such as no other species has ever shown to create change. They have made
their own history - though, of course, within limits. Those limits are now

very wide indeed, though once they were so narrow that we cannot pick
out the first step which took human evolution away from the determination
of nature. Human history began when the inheritance of genetics and
behaviour which had until then provided the only means of survival was
first broken through by conscious choice.

Once there was any power to break free, in however small a degree,
from the determinism of nature, a huge difference had been made. From
that point, human culture was progressive; it was increasingly built by
deliberate selection within it as well as by accident and natural pressure,
by the accumulation of a capital of experience and knowledge, and by
exploiting it. That is really the place where our story should start, if we
could identify it.

Evolution
Most biologists nowadays accept some form of a hypothesis which
accounts for evolution by ‘ natural selection ’. Not all do, but many would
agree that evolution operates through environment, a particular environment
favouring the survival of some genetic strains, and disfavouring
others. Genetic messages which are favoured are carried forward into the
next generation: those which are disfavoured are not, because the environment
eradicates them before the genetic inheritance has been passed on.
For example, certain mechanisms for conserving body heat exist in some
species which enable them to go on living in cold climates - penguins, for
example. Other species without those mechanisms cannot survive in
those climates, and so they are only to be found elsewhere, where they
can.

This may seem remote from the human story, but it is necessary to an
understanding of its roots in a very distant past. Biological evolution long
inched forward with incredible slowness within the possibilities offered by
diverse habitats, at first to different organisms and later to different animals.
The deciding factor in making these different habitats available was
climate. About forty million years ago a long climatic phase began to draw
to a close which had favoured great reptiles - of which the dinosaurs are
the most celebrated. The world was growing colder. As new climatic conditions
restricted their habitat, the great reptiles disappeared (some
believe that other factors than climate were at work). But the new conditions
suited other animal strains which were already about, among them
some mammals whose tiny ancestors had appeared two hundred million
years or so earlier. They now inherited the earth, or a considerable part of
it. With many breaks in sequence and accidents of selection on the way
these strains were themselves to evolve into the mammal families of
today, among them our own.


This is by no means the end of the story of climate as an evolutionary
selector. Although they took hundreds of millennia, even millions of
years, to run their full course, huge swings of temperature still occurred.
The resulting extremes, of freezing on the one hand and aridity on the

other, choked off some possible lines of development. Conversely, in other
times and places, the onset of appropriately benign conditions allowed
some species to flourish and encouraged their spread into new habitats. In
this immensely long process and even before the appearance of the creatures
from which humanity was to evolve, climate was both setting the
stage on which human history would take place and shaping, by selection,
the eventual genetic inheritance of humanity itself.

Fifty-five million or so years ago, primitive mammals were of two main
sorts. One, rodent - like, remained on the ground; the other took to the
trees. The competition of the two families for resources was thus lessened.
Strains of each survived to become eventually creatures we know today.
The second group are now called the prosimians. We are among their
descendants, for they were the ancestors of the first primates. What survived
in the next phase of evolution were genetic strains among the
prosimians which were best suited to the special uncertainties and accidental
challenges of the forest.

The risky, sometimes sun - dappled forest environment put a premium
on the capacity to learn. Strains prone to accident in such conditions were
wiped out. Those whose genetic inheritance could respond and adapt to
the surprising, sudden danger of deep shade, confused visual patterns,
and treacherous handholds survived. Among those which prospered
(genetically speaking) were some species with long digits which were to
develop into fingers and the oppositional thumb which makes it easy to
grasp a branch - and, later, a tool. Others evolved towards three - dimensional
vision, a diminished sense of smell, and the characteristic anthropoid face.
This story need not be followed further in details (it is not only
highly complicated, but one still much open to debate among specialists).
It is the necessary background, though, to the understanding of one of the
outcomes, the main branch of the primate family to which humans
belong, the hominids.
