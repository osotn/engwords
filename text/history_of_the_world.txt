BEGINNINGS

History is a word which traditionally means two different things: what
happened, and a true account of what happened. In the second sense, it is
always a selection from the past. Even the history of the whole world,
though, is not a selection from all the past. We can ignore most of Time. We
need not go back to the ' Big Bang ' from which our universe emerged in
order to understand where we are now. History is the story of human
beings, and it is the human past which concerns us. Even when historians
look at things beyond human control, such as geography, climate and, for
immense tracts of time, disease, they do so only because that helps to
explain why men and women lived and died in some ways rather than
others. Or, to put it another way, history in the first sense - what happened
- is what happened to and has been done by humans.

This cuts down the past we have to deal with by quite a lot, but still
leaves an enormous amount to be tackled. Nor does it make it very clear
where we are to begin. In theory, it could be with the first human being.
But we do not know when or where he or she appeared, even if we can
make responsible guesses within fairly broad limits. And, to make things
more difficult, not everyone agrees about what sort of creatures in early
times might be thought of as ' human '; and where the line between them
and other animals is crossed.

A clear line is very hard to draw. People do not now talk (as they once
did) about ' ape - men ' and ' missing links '. Physiology helps us to classify
data but what we call ' human ' is still a matter of a definition and disagreement
is possible. What is surely and identifiably unique about humans is
not just their possession of certain characteristics, but what they do with
them. What human beings have always shown is a cumulative capacity
such as no other species has ever shown to create change. They have made
their own history - though, of course, within limits. Those limits are now

very wide indeed, though once they were so narrow that we cannot pick
out the first step which took human evolution away from the determination
of nature. Human history began when the inheritance of genetics and
behaviour which had until then provided the only means of survival was
first broken through by conscious choice.

Once there was any power to break free, in however small a degree,
from the determinism of nature, a huge difference had been made. From
that point, human culture was progressive; it was increasingly built by
deliberate selection within it as well as by accident and natural pressure,
by the accumulation of a capital of experience and knowledge, and by
exploiting it. That is really the place where our story should start, if we
could identify it.

Evolution
Most biologists nowadays accept some form of a hypothesis which
accounts for evolution by ‘ natural selection ’. Not all do, but many would
agree that evolution operates through environment, a particular environment
favouring the survival of some genetic strains, and disfavouring
others. Genetic messages which are favoured are carried forward into the
next generation: those which are disfavoured are not, because the environment
eradicates them before the genetic inheritance has been passed on.
For example, certain mechanisms for conserving body heat exist in some
species which enable them to go on living in cold climates - penguins, for
example. Other species without those mechanisms cannot survive in
those climates, and so they are only to be found elsewhere, where they
can.

This may seem remote from the human story, but it is necessary to an
understanding of its roots in a very distant past. Biological evolution long
inched forward with incredible slowness within the possibilities offered by
diverse habitats, at first to different organisms and later to different animals.
The deciding factor in making these different habitats available was
climate. About forty million years ago a long climatic phase began to draw
to a close which had favoured great reptiles - of which the dinosaurs are
the most celebrated. The world was growing colder. As new climatic conditions
restricted their habitat, the great reptiles disappeared (some
believe that other factors than climate were at work). But the new conditions
suited other animal strains which were already about, among them
some mammals whose tiny ancestors had appeared two hundred million
years or so earlier. They now inherited the earth, or a considerable part of
it. With many breaks in sequence and accidents of selection on the way
these strains were themselves to evolve into the mammal families of
today, among them our own.


This is by no means the end of the story of climate as an evolutionary
selector. Although they took hundreds of millennia, even millions of
years, to run their full course, huge swings of temperature still occurred.
The resulting extremes, of freezing on the one hand and aridity on the

other, choked off some possible lines of development. Conversely, in other
times and places, the onset of appropriately benign conditions allowed
some species to flourish and encouraged their spread into new habitats. In
this immensely long process and even before the appearance of the creatures
from which humanity was to evolve, climate was both setting the
stage on which human history would take place and shaping, by selection,
the eventual genetic inheritance of humanity itself.

Fifty-five million or so years ago, primitive mammals were of two main
sorts. One, rodent - like, remained on the ground; the other took to the
trees. The competition of the two families for resources was thus lessened.
Strains of each survived to become eventually creatures we know today.
The second group are now called the prosimians. We are among their
descendants, for they were the ancestors of the first primates. What survived
in the next phase of evolution were genetic strains among the
prosimians which were best suited to the special uncertainties and accidental
challenges of the forest.

The risky, sometimes sun - dappled forest environment put a premium
on the capacity to learn. Strains prone to accident in such conditions were
wiped out. Those whose genetic inheritance could respond and adapt to
the surprising, sudden danger of deep shade, confused visual patterns,
and treacherous handholds survived. Among those which prospered
(genetically speaking) were some species with long digits which were to
develop into fingers and the oppositional thumb which makes it easy to
grasp a branch - and, later, a tool. Others evolved towards three - dimensional
vision, a diminished sense of smell, and the characteristic anthropoid face.
This story need not be followed further in details (it is not only
highly complicated, but one still much open to debate among specialists).
It is the necessary background, though, to the understanding of one of the
outcomes, the main branch of the primate family to which humans
belong, the hominids.

Hominids
The first apes and monkeys - then the most highly developed primates -
appeared 25 million or so years ago. They had much bigger bodies and
brains than the earlier primates. Among them evolved some strains particularly
well - suited to the savannahs which, as a result of climatic
change, were beginning to encroach on the forests. These creatures were
better able to cope with new conditions than the ‘ pongids ’, as the
ape / monkey families are termed. Some of them walked upright and
could run in a way an ape cannot. From them evolved the evolutionary
line called ‘ hominids ’. Fossil remains suggest that between three and four
million years ago we can begin to distinguish among them some who can
be reckoned among our ' ancestors ’. The earliest traces come from south
and east Africa. In what is now ' Tanzania, at a place called the Olduvai
gorge, discoveries in the 1950s turned earlier ideas about the origins of
mankind topsy - turvy. For the next forty years scholars went on extending

by new discoveries the time - span within which to argue about human
origins. There were to be many other important discoveries in Africa and
the conclusions first drawn are now very much questioned. But the
remains found in the Olduvai gorge are still the best starting - point for any
account of what we know.

They were not at first sight very impressive. A deal of searching produced
only a collection of bits and pieces which could all be got on to a
large table. Over a thousand teeth were found and a dozen or so skulls, but
only three hipbones and one shoulder - blade, and a scatter of other bones.
Nonetheless, these were the relics of creatures of a type hitherto
unknown. It was labelled ‘ Southern African ape ' - Australopithecus
africanus in the scientific classification system - and it looked as if these
particular specimens were between two and three million years old.

Australopithecus was about four feet tall and had hips, legs and feet
more like those of humans than those of apes. The skull was fairly ape - like,
though, held a brain about as big as that of a gorilla, and had a massive
jaw. The forelimbs ended in true hands, with fingertips that flattened at
the end like human fingers. What is more, some deductions about behaviour
can be made; there was evidence of habitation in the same place for
long periods and some scholars have also thought that Olduvai provides
the first evidence of hominid building, in the shape of a windbreak of
stones. Evidently, the creatures who lived there were meat - eaters, for
there were smashed bones about which had been broken up so that their
marrow and the brains from skulls could be got at. As there was no fire to
cook them, they must have been eaten raw. The meat was probably not
very attractive, because it is likely that it was carrion found by scavenging,
but that it was eaten at all is very important. For one thing, meat is a concentrated
food, so that those who eat it do not have to eat so continuously
or often. For another, it presented technical problems; smashing bones
and cutting off strips of skin or flesh cannot have been easy for creatures
descended from vegetarians and therefore without the sharp teeth and
claws of some mammals. They would need some help in solving these
problems. That may explain one of the most exciting discoveries made at
Olduvai: Australopithecus was a tool - maker.

Human qualities
Excavation revealed that different kinds of stone had been brought to
Olduvai after being picked up elsewhere. So, they had been selected. By
chipping flakes off them to give a jagged edge, they had then been turned
into crude choppers which could be held in the hand - the first consciously
made cutting tools. Here, about two million years ago, technology begins.
Olduvai is the first landmark in the long, slow spreading across the world
of purposefully made implements. They were to be refined, improved and
enormously multiplied, but stone tools provided for most of human prehistory
and even for most of the time our own species has existed the main
equipment for dealing with the environment.

Many problems about what was found at Olduvai remain unsettled;
above all, that of deciding whether these creatures really are part of
human ancestry at all. They are certainly hominids but they may belong
to another strain than that from which we descend, only our remote
cousins, so to speak, instead of our direct progenitors. Though they share
some characteristics with later humans, they were also very different - in
the shape of their skulls, for example, and their small stature. Some argue
that there is a common ‘ancestor’ in some other strain, further back, from
which both we and Australopithecus descended. But this debate is probably
less important than another: where do they come on the scale of evolution?
Have we really reached with them some elementary kind of human
being? Another way of putting this would be to ask when prehistory begins
and natural history is left behind. But such questions are largely about definitions:
answering them depends on what you have chosen to regard as
the essence of being human.

Some people have said it is a matter of language. But other animals
make noises which are signals, or appear to gesture: when does this
become language? As for building, ants, bees, birds and beavers do it very
impressively. Another suggested criterion is tool - using. This, too, is not
something which is absolutely confined to human beings. People have
observed apes using sticks to poke at insects' nests or to help them to reach
objects out of their grasp. Yet the very few higher primates other than
humankind which have been seen to use tools do so only in a very simple
way (as these examples suggest) and they do not seem to make tools with
a sense of purpose and the idea that a future benefit will result; perhaps
tool - making is a better test. Man is the only creature whom we know to
think deliberately about possible changes in the environment and ways to
produce them.

The Olduvai evidence suggests one reason for thinking that the early
inhabitants of that site were different in kind from other primates. Since
stones, and probably meat too, were brought there from some distances,
and since it also seems likely that because of their physique the offspring of
Australopithecus could not cling to their mothers for foraging expeditions as
do those of other primates, we may have at Olduvai the first known example
of creatures with a home base. Among the primates, only human beings
have places where the females and young stay for long periods while the
males search for food and bring it back to them. This has suggested something
else about the mind of Australopithecus, too: however crudely and
vaguely, these creatures seem to have been able to exercise some forethought,
resisting the temptation to break up their food and eat it where it
was found, and showing enough self-control to carry it home for consumption.
The curbing of natural impulses with future satisfaction in view lies at
the roots of everything humanity has achieved. It is the mechanism psychologists
call ‘ inhibition ’. This is the faint beginning of conscious planning.

But later discoveries have now complicated matters further. Australopithecus
now seems to have existed in several species and elsewhere in


East Africa evidence has recently been found of some other creatures
living at the same time which seem even more like later humans, at least
in physique. So australopithecines were not the only hominids on the
scene two or three million years ago. Because they seem much more manlike
in physical terms, some of the other creatures about at the same time
have therefore been given the family name of Homo (the Latin word for
man). One of them whose remains turned up a few years ago near Lake
Rudolf in Kenya seems to have been about five feet tall and to have had a
brain about twice the size of a modern chimpanzee.

It is not easy for laymen to pick their way among evidence that scholars
argue fiercely about it. And we ought never to forget that we are for the
most part at the mercy of what we are lucky enough to find. We do not
have to believe that what was found at Olduvai was typical of the rest of the
world, or even of East Africa, around 2,000,000 bc - it may just be what
happens to have survived. The picture could be transformed if other evidence
turned up. But at least it seems probable that the origins of mankind
are to be sought in Africa, where three (and perhaps four) million years
ago creatures of more than one species in some ways already like humans
lived. Some of them - the australopithecines in particular - seem to have
gone on to be very successful in biological terms; there is evidence that by
about 1,000,000 bc they could be found all over the world outside the
Americas and Australia.


Homo erectus
Though the story rapidly becomes very complicated after about 2,000,000
BC scholars have now become very good at making distinctions between
different hominids. What matters for our purpose, though, is simply to
note that the biological strain leading to humanity showed its superior efficiency
by the fact of surviving at all. Across climatic ups and downs spanning
millions of years, the survival and spread of species with human
characteristics show that however feebly developed they seem to us, they
adapted to changing conditions as many species could not. Though we are
talking of climatic changes which took tens of thousands of years, this was
rapid by comparison with the millions of years of much steadier conditions
which lay in the past and they included what we call the ' Ice Ages ',
each lasting between fifty and a hundred thousand years. They covered
big areas of the northern hemisphere (including much of Europe, and
America as far south as modern New York) with great ice sheets, sometimes
a mile or more thick. Scholars have now distinguished seventeen or
nineteen (there is argument about the exact number) such glaciations
since the onset of the first, over three million years ago. The most recent
came to an end some ten thousand years ago.

They had huge impacts on life and evolution. The slow onset of the ice
was decisive and sometimes disastrous for what lay in its path. Our landscapes
are still shaped by its scourings and gougings thousands of centuries
ago. The vast inundations which followed when the ice melted must

in their turn also have been locally catastrophic, destroying the habitats of
creatures which had adapted to the challenge of arctic conditions. Yet they
also created new opportunities; new species could spread into the areas
uncovered by the thaw. Possibly more important still for the global story of
evolution, though, were the coolings and warmings which took place thousands
of miles from the ice itself. New environments appeared; aridification
and the spread of grassland both transformed the life - chances of
existing species, some of which form part of the human evolutionary
story. Africa was far from even the greatest ice - fields.

Climate can of course still be very important today, but only locally,
and in a much shorter term; it no longer absolutely determines where the
human species can survive. In prehistoric times it did, and could be offset
only by slowly acquired physical and mental characteristics. Among the
hominids, some strains were better equipped than others to grapple with
nature and, in a measure, to master it. We can return to the human
thumb, whose remote origins have already been mentioned. It is a much
more useful and impressive instrument than we often remember. It can
be brought together with the first finger to hold very small objects, and it
can curl round the haft of a weapon or tool to give a good grip. It makes it
much easier to go in for tool-making (as well as playing the piano, painting
a picture, or hitch-hiking, of course). But the crucial human superiority
to other animals was probably a bigger brain. Perhaps this was what
allowed some hominids to take thought for the morrow. Together with the
existence of the home base, that made survival easier. Hominid children
take a long time to grow up and thoughtfulness and a home base made it
more likely that they would survive to become parents in their turn. Some
rest and possible recovery from sickness or accident also became possible.
However it worked, the upshot is clear; somehow the species with
the most ‘human’ characteristics were slowly screened somewhat from
nature’s harsh mechanism of evolutionary selection. Hitherto, nature had
worked by eliminating genetic strains unable to adapt physically to environmental
challenge. Once prudence, forethought and skill made it possible
for some of them to avoid disaster, a new force was at work in
selection - and it looks very much like what we call human intelligence.
It is at this junction, as it were, that we begin to look for the station at
which we get off for humanity. It provides the first signs of that positive,
conscious impact upon environment which marks the earliest human
achievements.

All such thoughts, though, are still very speculative. We must never
forget that we have very thin evidence for much of prehistory. Europe, for
example, has just one cave where tools similar to those of Australopithecus
in Africa have been found and they date from just over a million years
ago.

Not until we are well past that time, do we begin to have evidence of
another important step in human evolution. After appearing about
800,000 Bc, a creature of new physical type spread gradually over the

whole ' Old World ' (that is, the land-mass of Africa, Europe and Asia,
which is now separated from the Americas and Australasia) by about
250,000 BC. Its earliest forms are called Homo habilis (' clever man ’) and
later developments into another species have been called Homo erectus
(' upright man ').

The crucial difference between Homo erectus and earlier manlike creatures
is size - above all, size of brain. One strain among them developed a
brain about twice the size of Australopithecus and much nearer that of
modern man than the brain of any earlier hominid. There were other
large-brained manlike creatures about and pieces of some of them have
turned up as far away as China and Java, but it looks as if the type originated
in Africa and then spread to Europe and most of Asia. Scholars have
tried to measure how long this spread took. One theory is three or four
thousand years, during which Homo erectus spread on the average at something
like a mile a year northwards across what is now the Sahara and the
Near East to France. Though the species has left no fossil remains in
Europe, it lasted about ten times longer than has mankind as we know it.
Homo erectus can be traced by special tools: the so-called stone ' hand axe ’
is the most important evidence. By plotting the places where it is found,
scholars have discovered where the species flourished.


Hunting
In spite of the huge gaps in our knowledge, there can be no doubt that
Homo erectus was a very successful species. Where did its bigger brains
come from? Here are more mysteries, but it seems most likely that a
change in diet explains the emergence of a new physical type. Eating more
meat would have helped creatures with larger stature than the average to
survive and reproduce. This may well be connected with the appearance
of the first specialized skill; hunting.

The first meat-eaters seem either to have relied on small prey like reptiles
and rodents or to have eaten the carrion found where bigger animals
had died. Right at the beginning of the archaeological record, an elephant
and perhaps giraffes and buffaloes helped provide meat consumed at
Olduvai, but for long after this the bones of smaller animals vastly preponderate
in the rubbish. Scavenging for them must have been unreliable,
and changed into true hunting - big-game hunting, too - only very slowly.
But change it did and the consequences were very great. Alongside a
growth in the size of the animal remains found among the relics of
primeval diet can be seen a parallel growth in the size of the skulls of the
eaters. By about 300,000 bc elephants were being killed and cut up on the
spot; the remains of large numbers of these (at one site, about fifty) have
been found. Over the same period (and down to later times, too) the shape
of the teeth and jaws of manlike creatures slowly evolves from those of
predominantly vegetable-eating species. There is a chicken-and-egg
aspect to this. The better diet to be got from organized hunting was only
available to creatures already at least advanced enough to carry out such a

complicated operation. This once more shows the speeding-up of evolutionary
change. An enormous new range of capacities and skills comes
into being somewhere between 1,000,000 and 100,000 bc, and they made
the first human societies possible.

A NEW GRASP OF THE WORLD
Before big-game hunting could become possible someone had to know a
lot about animals' habits and to be able to pass this knowledge on to others,
both those engaged in the cooperative enterprise of hunting, and from
generation to generation. Some kind of speech, therefore, must have
existed. It has been argued that genetic selection which led to changes in
the shape of the brain favoured the development of language. How Australopithecus
communicated may never be known, but even lower primates
have ways of doing so. Perhaps the first steps in the organization of
language would have been the breaking up of calls like those of other animals
into particular sounds capable of re-arrangement. This would make
different messages possible. But other changes may have helped, too.
Better vision, a growing sense of the world as lots of separate objects, and
the making of new things (tools) were all going on simultaneously over
hundreds of thousands of years in which language was evolving. Together
they slowly made possible the coming of abstract thought (thinking about
things not actually present). And this trend must have been reinforced
when hunting made record and memory more important still.

A big range of techniques and skills was also needed for hunting. ' to
trap and kill such monsters as the mammoth or woolly rhinoceros with the
help only of weapons of stone or wood was enormously difficult. Numbers
and discipline were needed to drive them to a killing-ground favourable
because of a bog in which a weighty creature would flounder, or because it
offered good vantage points or secure platforms to the hunters. Once dead,
the victims presented further problems. With nothing but wood and stone
tools, they had to be cut up. The meat had then to be carried home.

Bigger meat supplies were a tiny step towards a little leisure; the consumers
were released temporarily from the drudgery of ceaseless rummaging
about for small, but continuously available, dollops of
nourishment and had time to do something else. They could add to the
existing technology. Besides making more elaborate, bifacial hand-axes.
Homo erectus has also left the first certain evidence of constructed
dwellings, the earliest worked wood, the first wooden spear and the earliest
container, a wooden bowl. Inventing things on this scale shows a pace
of development and a capacity quite different from what has gone before.
Minds were forming ideas of objects before manufacture was begun. Some
have even argued that simple forms (triangles, ellipses and ovals) used in
huge numbers of stone tools, can be seen as the first beginnings of art - the
production of objects giving pleasure because of their form, as well as
being useful.

The coming of fire
The greatest of the technical and cultural advances of Homo erectus was to
learn to manage fire. The earliest evidence of its use comes from China
(c. 600,000 Bc) but it does not show that fire could be made. Probably Homo
erectus never got so far. Still, that the species could make use of it was an
enormous gain, the most important single change in technology before
the coming of agriculture. It was the first chemical tapping of energy other
than by the conversion of food inside the body.

Many peoples have had legends of heroic figures or magical beasts
who first seize fire, often from the gods. Perhaps this reflects a dim
memory that the first fire was taken from a natural source, whether from
volcanic activity, an outbreak of natural gas, or a blazing forest. However
it was obtained, the use of fire was revolutionary - though we must
remember that it took hundreds of thousands of years to develop its full
impact. Immediately, it meant warmth and light, the conquest of the cold
and the dark and therefore the extension of the habitable environment
into them, even if only a little way at first. Families could survive in
colder regions than before, and could live in temperate zones with a little
more ease. By occupying caves whose darkness had previously made
them unusable, they were safer from the weather. Animals could now be
driven out of their lairs and kept out (perhaps this was how the idea came
of using fire to drive big game in hunting). Wooden spears could be hardened
in fires. Cooking became possible. As a result, eating became easier;
marrow can be sucked out of cooked bones but getting it out raw is a laborious
business. Gibbons and gorillas have to spend much of their time
simply chewing their raw food; cooking saved time, for food softened by
it did not have to be chewed so long. Time was thus made available to do
other things. More important still, substances indigestible in their raw
state could become sources of food; distasteful or bitter plants could
be made edible. This must have increased food supply (and therefore
made population growth a little easier). It may also have stimulated attention
to the variety and availability of plant life and so have launched the
science of botany and the art of cookery. Finally, in the long run, eating
cooked food helped to alter the shape of the face and the form of the
teeth.

Cooking would have encouraged further restraint on immediate
impulses, too: you put off eating and did not give way to immediate appetite
by swallowing raw food. The focus of the cooking fire as a source of light and
warmth would have brought people together around it after dark and
helped to make a group more aware of itself as a community. They would
have talked somehow; the development of language - of whose origins we
know little - must have speeded up in this setting. Finally, fire slowly
brought new distinctions between members of the group. At some point,
fire - bearers and fire specialists appeared, beings of awesome and mysterious
importance, for on them might depend life and death for the rest of the
group. They carried and guarded the great liberating tool, and controlled its

power to break up the iron rigidity and discipline of night and day and even
that of the seasons.
During the age of Homo erectus, then, fire had already a little offset the
pressures of the great external rhythms of the natural world on hominid
life. Life was already less dominated by routine and less automatic than it
had been for Australopithecus; it was now far removed from that of animals
merely programmed by instinct and genetic endowment. Homo erectus
could make choices. This is the best ground for saying that with this
species we are already on the human side of any definition of the difference
between apes and men, however cramped and miserable its life may
appear.


Early society
It is easier to form a picture of the material circumstances of ancient life
than of what was going on inside the bigger brains now grappling with
those circumstances. But looking at the material remains is really all that
we can hope to do. That can tell us something. It is worth thinking once
more about big game hunting. Once Homo erectus became dependent on
meat, he became a parasite on the herds of game - and therefore had to
follow them about, or explore new territory in search of them - and was
more likely to settle and multiply in some places than others. There home
bases would be established. Some of them seem to have been occupied for
thousands and thousands of years.

The family which lived in the home base was developing, too. The existence
of that base already made it likely that the future human family would
be very different from animal families. This became clearer as the predecessors
of Homo sapiens grew bigger. The larger heads required to accommodate
bigger brains, for instance, meant both that children would be
bigger before birth - and this was reflected in changes in the female pelvis
which permitted the birth of offspring with larger heads - and also that a
longer period of growth after birth was needed for children to mature. No
physiological change in the female could provide ante-natal accommodation
to protect them until physical maturity. Human children, in consequence,
unlike most mammals, whose offspring mature within months,
need maternal care long after birth. Prolonged infancy, dependence and
the support of children by the family and society during immaturity meant
that human families developed in a way very unlike the families of other
animals. Part of this was a result of genetic selection; large litters ceased to
be the way in which the survival of the species was assured. Instead,
human societies have learnt to give more and longer attention to the protection,
nurture and training of their young (now often running on into
their twenties). Sharper differences between the patterns of life of males
and females appeared. Hominid mothers were very much more tied down
than the mothers of other primates and fathers became more involved in
the provision of food by hunting, which demanded arduous and prolonged
activity in which the females could not easily join.


Another result of prolonged infancy was that learning and memory
became more and more important. Here too, we seem to cross a line with
Homo erectus. The genetic programming of humanity's predecessors is
somehow replaced by conscious learning about the environment and
reflexion on it. Somewhere a great change has occurred in which tradition
and culture - the things the members of a community learn from one
another - take over from physiological inheritance as a factor in evolutionary
selection, though we may never actually be able to say exactly
where this change occurs.

Of course the physiological inheritance still remains very important.
Clearly it mattered greatly to the future shape of human society, for
instance, that one particular genetic strain long ago gave our species a
unique sexual characteristic. Among all other mammals, both the sexual
attraction exercised by the female on the male and her fertility are
restricted to certain periods. We speak of animals as being 'on heat’ at
these times, and when they are in this condition their lives are very much
disrupted. If they had then to look after young, they could not possibly
continue to nurture them. Human females do not work like this and this is
very important. If they were like other animals, their slowly maturing offspring
would have often been neglected in infancy and could hardly have
survived. It may have taken a million years or so for a genetic strain with
a sexual characteristic which dispensed with ' oestrus ’, as it is called, to
emerge, but once it did so, the consequences for the future development
of humanity were enormous and were to affect much else we take for
granted about the way we live. The fact that human females were continuously
attractive to human males (and not only so at periods when each
sex was being regulated by automatic mechanisms of attraction) must
have made individual choice a much more important factor in mating.
This is the beginning of a very long and obscure road which leads to later
notions of sexual love. Together with the longer childhood and greater
dependency made possible by better food-gathering, it points ahead also to
the stable and enduring human family unit - father, mother and offspring
- who remain together and constitute a real community. This is an institution
which only humans have, even if not every human family is like
that and modern social arrangements often now tell against it.

Once more, though, we are much at the mercy of guesswork. We ought
to be very cautious. We can say little that is certain about the social life of
our predecessors. Yet it is difficult not to feel that (however slowly) what
happened to early hominids laid down the main lines of much of human
life long before humans like ourselves existed. Culture and tradition gradually
took over from genetic mutation and natural selection as the primary
source of change among the hominids - or, to put it another way, what was
learnt was becoming as important for survival as what was biologically
inherited. The groups with the best ' memories ' of effective ways of doing
things and increasing power to reflect upon them would have carried forward
human evolution fastest. Attempts have been made to trace its

progress in the actual physiological evolution of the cortex, the mass of
cells making up the brain itself

Yet when we try to think about prehistoric mental processes, we can be
sure of little except that they were almost inconceivably different from our
own. All we can say is that the life of Homo erectus looks more like human,
than pre-human, life. Physically, the creature’s brain was of an order of
magnitude comparable to our own, even if its skull was somewhat differently
shaped. Homo erectus made tools in different styles in different
places, built shelters, took over natural shelter by exploiting fire, and sallied
forth from it to hunt and gather food. It did this in groups showing
some discipline and able to transmit ideas by speech, and founded on the
home base and a distinction between the activities of males and females.
There may even have been other specializations; fire-bearers, or old creatures
whose memories made them the databanks of their ' societies ’, could
in some measure be supported by the labour of others.

There is nothing to be gained by looking, though, for some prehistoric
dividing line. The evidence for one does not exist. All we can confidently
say is that things had turned out in a certain way. When one or more subspecies
of Homo erectus evolved at last into Homo sapiens, a new physical
type, a big achievement and heritage was already pretty secure in their
grasp. Individuals come naked into the world, but humanity did not. It
bore with it from the past all, indeed, that made it humanity.

HOMO SAPIENS
On the scale of prehistoric time our own species. Homo sapiens, has not
been about on earth for very long. Homo erectus exploited the world successfully
about ten times longer than we have done. But there are no firm
lines and for thousands of years many different species of hominids must
have lived on earth, the end of one branch of the family overlapping by
many generations the early generations of another. This is one reason why
it is difficult to date the next important hominid species, beyond saying
that it flourished somewhere between 250,000 and 50,000 bc. By the last
date it was about to give way to human beings recognizably like ourselves.

The Neanderthals
The story begins with the discovery in Europe of two skulls about a quarter
of a million years old. They were of a different shape from those of
Homo erectus and had yet bigger brains. Still, they were not much like
those of modern humans and they do not tell us much more than that
something other than Homo erectus already existed. Then an Ice Age
descends and no more relics of them or of other hominids turn up until
fossils appear from about 100,000 bc, in the middle of the next warm
period. These show a big step forward, for they are the first traces within
the family Homo of the species called sapiens. Strictly, it is called Homo
sapiens neandertalensis, being thus labelled after the place where the first

skull announcing its existence was found - the Neanderthal valley in Germany,
not far from Diisseldorf Neanderthals would have looked somewhat
`unlike most modern human beings, not having much of a chin and
being very thick-set in build. Indeed, the first skull found was so oddly
shaped that it was thought by some scientists to be the skull of a modern
idiot. Some modern people may somewhat resemble Neanderthals; we
need not exaggerate the differences, and we know they were right-handed,
like most modern humans, so there are similarities which go deep. The
crucial difference from earlier hominids is their bigger brains.

Because the Neanderthals cannot easily be linked to earlier hominids,
some people have been tempted to think they must have been in some
way cut off from them, perhaps by the ice. As more evidence has turned
up, though, it has become clear that they were very widely spread, from
western Europe and Morocco at one extreme, to China at the other, with
other settlements in the Near East, Iraq and Iran. The earliest Neanderthal
in China may indeed go back to 200,000 bc. At all events, they were certainly
living over much of Europe and Asia in about 80,000 bc, just before
the onset of another Ice Age (and one of the worst). Though they look
physically primitive to modern eyes, the Neanderthals were very successful,
much more capable and mentally more advanced than anything
which had appeared on earth before them. As the ice returned, they did
not go south but did their best to cope with the cold, moving into caves for
protection and using fires kept going in hearths dug in their floors. Caves
can hardly have been very comfortable places. Besides being smoky from
the fire (which probably burnt animal fat and bones as wood grew scarcer
in the new tundras produced by the glaciation), they would have become
smelly from the rubbish on the floor, and damp at the back, where the
fire's heat would not penetrate. But caves made it easier to survive. Those
chosen nearly always looked south so as to assure as much sunlight as possible,
and may have had skin curtains at their mouths in the winter
months.

This was putting technology to use in a new way. The Neanderthals
wore skins, too, and made better-shaped stone tools than earlier toolmakers.
The growth in power over nature suggests that they had complex
languages, though some scientists have argued that their skulls suggest
that those parts of the brain which deal with speech are not so well developed
as other parts. Yet they must have had some very advanced ideas -
and therefore words in which to express them because they also did something
else quite new; they buried their dead. Some graves show signs of
careful attention. Near Samarkand the body of a Neanderthal child was
buried inside a ring of animal horns; another grave, in Iraq, contained a
man’s body surrounded with masses of wild flowers and grasses placed
there before he was buried. Such things are important. Not only are they
the beginning of a long and rich line of evidence about the past obtained
by digging up graves, but because they suggest an enormous important
change in thinking. Why, after all, did the Neanderthals bury their dead?

The exact answer we do not and probably cannot know, but perhaps
some Neanderthals were beginning to experiment with ritual. They may
have sought to control nature by carrying out certain acts in order to make
things happen. Perhaps, even, these burials and the faint traces of rituals
involving animals which are to be found on other Neanderthal sites mark
the beginnings of religion. Someone may have already begun to believe in
another world, invisible but powerful, even one in which an afterlife
might be possible. We do not know. However we speculate, though, it
seems clear that with the Neanderthals we reach a new mental level. The
new indicators, like the size of the Neanderthal skull and the big brain it
held tell us these are humans, who can in some ways think abstractly - as
we can. They had a new order of mental resources with which to face the
challenges of the last Ice Age, to which they adapted successfully, lasting
long into the cold era. Probably they lived on besides other human stocks,
perhaps sometimes mating with them, perhaps contending with them,
though, they were in the end vanquished, genetically speaking.

They were supplanted by the branch of the family to which we belong.
Homo sapiens sapiens. It seems to have evolved separately from the Neanderthals
and to represent a different line of hominid descent, with lighter
skulls, smaller faces and straighter limbs. Its members are traceable first in
the Levant, the Near East and the Balkans between 50,000 and 40,000 bc.
Perhaps they advanced northwards and west as the ice retreated. By the
latter date they were well-established in western Europe (where Homo
sapiens has sometimes been called 'Cro-Magnon Man'). Arrival in the Far
East seems to have been later. Somewhere about 30,000 bc, too, humans
had crossed the Bering Strait after the retreat of the ice and thus entered
the Americas (until then, so far as we know, without hominid inhabitants).
For the next fifteen thousand years or so, their successors moved slowly
southward until human beings lived all over the later Americas. Meanwhile,
others had reached Australia, where the first human remains have
been dated to about 25,000 bc.

This was a huge achievement. No other primates had spread so widely.
Nor was any later to do so, except through human agency. Yet although
human beings spread throughout the world, and at a remarkable rate by
comparison with earlier species, for a long time there were not many of
them. One scholar has suggested that in 40,000 bc there were probably
only about 10,000,000 in all. (Others have suggested 20,000 at most for the
whole of France in Neanderthal times.) It was a world thus almost unimaginably
different from our own, yet one in which human beings had already
achieved amazing things and were showing more clearly than ever their
power to change it for themselves.

Physical type
In a biologist, human beings are all members of the same species. There
may be very little precise similarity between any two individuals (except
identical twins), and no animals vary individually in appearance so much

as we do. Nonetheless, we are all human beings. Striking divisions of
appearance among us - in colour of skin, shape of eyes and nose, straightness
or crinkliness of hair and so on - do not prevent human beings from
choosing partners with different physical features from their own and
from having children who in varying measure share physical features with
both parents. It is important to remember this, because at different times
some people have thought that the main differences of appearance
between human beings based on racial characteristics reflected deeper differences,
too, which were also part of their physical heritage. This is no
longer a favoured view, though it still has supporters. The differences in
the way different groups of people behave are very real, but their origins
now tend to be seen in circumstance, different traditions and ways of life
- in culture, all that they learn from their community - and not in a
genetic endowment like that of skin colour or shape of feature.

Such physical differences nonetheless still divide mankind into certain
large groups of markedly different appearance. Most people fall into one of
what were long and traditionally called the main ' races ’ of mankind, so far
as appearance goes. Though these divisions are not genetically absolute
and are now distrusted as liable to be the basis of unjust discriminatory
practice, they were what human beings actually saw and recognized for the
whole period of historical record. On this basis, and setting aside complex
distinctions which are for most purposes more important, the bulk of the
world’s population falls into three major groups, Negroid, Caucasoid and
Mongoloid. Negroid peoples are black or very dark skinned, usually have
woolly hair and vary much in stature. They often have broad, flattish noses
and thick lips. Most peoples of this physical type are to be found around the
equatorial regions of Africa, but others live across the Indian Ocean as far
away as New Guinea, Fiji, the Philippine islands and even Iksmania. Caucasoids,
too, were scattered at an early date over a broad area, to the north
of the Negroid peoples, in North Africa, Europe, western Asia. They have
often been called ‘white’, though their skins vary in colour from very fair
(so fair that it cannot tan) to deep brown. There are Caucasoids in India and
Ceylon who even have black skins, but otherwise are much like Europeans
in that they have relatively narrow noses and lips, straight or wavy hair and
a tendency to grow heavy beards. Similarly, the skin of the Mongoloids can
vary from yellow to dark brown. Their other characteristics are straight,
usually black hair, scanty beards, flattish faces and slanted, almond-shaped
eyes. Their main homelands are in central Asia, China and Japan, but they
also live in Malaysia and Indonesia. Some scholars believe that the original
American Indians, both north and south, were Mongoloid, but this is not
settled; the immigrants to the Americas of 20,000 or so years ago may have
belonged to groups more Caucasoid in physical character.


These three main groups are now so distributed about so much of the
earth, and have interbred so much, that mankind today is very complicated
in appearance, as well as genetic inheritance. There are, too, still
peoples elsewhere, notably in the southern hemisphere, who do not fit into

these three groups, notably the Australian aborigines, or the Bushmen of
the Kalahari desert. Of the way these major physical divisions of humanity
appeared, there is little than can be said. Except for its bones, the human
body does not keep well. Skin, fat, and other tissues all decay rapidly. We
can look at skulls from long ages ago, but bodies from which we can safely
make deductions about appearance are only available from a few thousand
years back. By then, the main distinctions of appearance were well - established.
It is probable, though, that the three major groups appeared in different
areas and spread out from them until they met the others and
sometimes mingled with them. But the basic mechanisms originally at
work were probably those of natural selection, by environment, of genetic
strains well-adapted to some areas, climates, diets, altitudes, latitudes, and
so on, once early humans had acquired the means of surviving there. In
cold climates, for example, Mongoloids are efficient biological machines
because they have more fat just under the skin than Caucasoids or
Negroids. Caucasoids, because they lived for the most part in more temperate
regions, did not need this; nor did they need the skin pigmentation
protecting black peoples against sunlight; the sun was not so fierce in
Europe and western Asia. This does not take us far. But we know also that
changes of diet and environment can produce striking changes in
physique and appearance in only a few generations. It seems likely, then,
that only after about 40,000 bc, in the era during which Homo sapiens
spread out to establish himself all over the globe and confront new conditions, 
did what we think of as the enduring physical differences between

humans appear. Only those differences made it possible for human life to
establish itself easily in some regions at all. When they did, they fairly soon
led to a racial distribution which remained fairly stable until only recently
- only since about ad 1500 has it changed much.

HUMANITY IN THE OLD STONE AGE

Most of the time human beings have been on earth falls in what has long
been called ' the Stone Age’, a fairly familiar term, but one used very
loosely, and one of three invented to talk about pre-history: the Stone,
Bronze and Iron ages. Scholars keep coming back to them because more
precise and complicated ways of describing prehistory have their own disadvantages.
They are based on the fact that mankind successively learnt
how to use stone, bronze and iron. In other words, they classify human
development; they get away from divisions of time based on rocks, biology
or climate such as geologists and palaeontologists employ and concentrate
on what human beings have done and the tools they use. But there are
some awkward things about this way of looking at the human past, useful
as it is. There are no clear endings and beginnings to such divisions. Even
very recently, the Stone Age was still going on in some parts of the world,
though only just. There are still a few people alive who live with tools not
much better than those of prehistoric men, though their numbers are
rapidly shrinking. Another awkwardness of the particular term ' Stone Age ’
is that it has to cover an enormous stretch of time, during much of which
we are not really sure whether we are dealing with humans in the full sense
at all, though we are certainly dealing with makers and users of stone tools
{Homo erectus, for example). Because of this, prehistorians have divided up
the Stone Age further still. We need not bother very much in this book with
most of the terms they use, but one of them, the ' Palaeolithic ' (or ' Old Stone
Age ’, from Greek words meaning old stones) takes up by far the greater part
of human prehistory and continues down to about 10,000 bc. This spans the
last really cold spell and the period during which Homo sapiens established
himself widely, a sub-division sometimes called the ' upper Palaeolithic ’
(because, archaeologically speaking, evidence about it tends to be found in
the upper levels of excavations). Over such a long period - perhaps 30,000
years - general statements about what life was like should be cautious.
Climates were very different in different parts of the world, fauna and flora
offered different opportunities and presented different challenges, and
human beings were all the time growing more diverse in the ways they did
things, in what we can call their traditional cultures.

Tool - making
It is certain, though, that the pace of change was very slow in the upper
Palaeolithic. There would have been little variety during most of it in the
way people lived except those imposed by the availability of food. Hunting
and gathering must have been the rule. Cro-Magnon Europeans seem to

have been especially expert as fishers and hunters, and developed new
techniques, with nets and barbed arrows. The tool - kit of Homo sapiens was
better than that of any predecessor and went on improving. Long before,
in pre-human times, the first cutting tools had been made of whatever suitable
material came to hand; examples of pebbles, quartzite and even fossil
wood have been found. But as time passed, flint was used more and more.
After hundreds of thousands of years, in some places it may even have
become somewhat scarce, because early methods of shaping it were very
wasteful. Sometimes nine-tenths of a lump had to be flaked away to give
an edge. In upper Palaeolithic times, primitive craftsmen began to work
out new ways of making flint tools. A core of flint rather like a tube or cone
was shaped in such a way that there could be flaked from it ' blades ’ of flint
whose sides were nearly parallel and with a pretty uniform thickness. Not
only was this economical, but such blades could be refined further to make
very thin and beautiful, tools. The best of these seem to have been made in
Europe and the Levant.

Among new and specialized tools thus made possible were chisels for
carving wood or bone called ‘burins'. They had narrow edges for cutting,
gouging and engraving, backed by broad edges to give them strength. They
must have helped the human advance into new regions, especially northward,
because they made it possible to use antlers or mammoth tusks for
spearheads and harpoons. Ivory and antler are stronger than wood and
more elastic than flint, and such implements lasted longer than earlier
ones. It has been suggested that burin-making (whose techniques can be
traced from Europe across the northern hemisphere as far as the Bering
Strait and Alaska) may have been what made possible human invasion of
the Americas. Burins are not found in the southern hemisphere, which
may be negative evidence of their special value in working materials
which provided food and clothing in cold climates. Another new flint - working
skill was the making of tiny flint 'blades' to be fitted to weapons
and other instruments made of wood or bone. One of them was the sickle
or reaping knife in use in several places by the end of the old Stone Age. It
does not show that people were growing crops, but that they had learnt to
recognize and collect certain wild grain plants. Animals were hunted more
easily, too, by hunters with bows and flint-tipped arrows, spears and spear -
throwers. These weapons were very important; the bow and spear - thrower
greatly increased the velocity - and therefore the range, accuracy and
killing-power - of missile weapons. Many of these things were made from
the new materials of bone, antler and wood. Some of them could be used
to tap new sources of food by making fish-hooks and harpoons from them.
Bone also made needles possible and very fine examples of them survive
from the last hunting cultures of the Palaeolithic.

Life styles
Much of this suggests, correctly, that there was more food available. Yet in
spite of this and in spite of a basic physical similarity to ourselves, people

in the Stone Age were still shorter and lighter than later humans. They
cannot have had a balanced diet (Neanderthals seem to have suffered from
vitamin deficiencies) and their meat must often have been semi-putrid.
Still, even today people like to eat game which is high. Probably few Stone
Age humans survived to reach forty. Those who did would have lived on to
a pretty miserable old age by our standards, racked by the pains of arthritis
and rheumatism, suffering from scurvy and threatened with death by
every broken bone or, even though they would not have had sugar to help
rot them as we do, by rotting teeth. This would go on being true for many
people in the world for a long time to come, of course.

Fire - using had greatly enlarged the choice of where to live. The first
evidence of fire - making dates from about 30,000 bc. It must have made life
easier. But clothes and man - made dwellings also show other ways of mastering
the environment in the upper Paleolithic. Without them it would
have been impossible for mankind to settle over the whole surface of the
globe as it has done. There were no textiles, but skins were cut into thongs
and strips which were then softened and made flexible in flint thong - shapers,
to provide clothes. The oldest clothed body which has been discovered
dates from about 35,000 bc. It was found in Russia and was dressed 
in fur trousers and a decorated shirt.

In the Upper Palaeolithic we also begin to see faint signs of purpose
- built dwellings. Other animals can build, but only in narrow, inherited
ways programmed by instinct. Human beings can build anywhere, adapting
style and technique to local climate, terrain and materials, and on
whatever scale suits their purposes. Probably the main materials used at
first for shelter (other than piled stones) were mud and reeds, which
quickly decay. Also, until the very end of the Old Stone Age humans had
to move about with the herds of game they hunted over the year, and
though this seems to have brought them back time and again to certain
caves which have traces of long occupancy, it did not leave permanent
building behind. Nevertheless, some remains of huts from about 9000 bc
have been found in the Near East. On the plains of eastern Europe (where
there were few caves) there seem to have been quite big dwellings with
frames made of mammoth bones or tusks covered in skins. They had
floors sunk two or three feet into the ground and were sometimes grouped
in settlements of some hundreds of people. This suggests the beginnings
of a new scale of social organization.

The first art
Clearly, humanity had come a very long way by the late Stone Age. One of
the most striking signs of it comes from a relatively small part of western
Europe, where we find the finest evidence we yet possess of the beginnings
of art. It begins with little stockpiles of red ochre collected by Neanderthals
about fifty thousand years ago. They have been much studied, but
we really do not know what they were for. The difficulty in talking about
the origins of art is that so little evidence survives of its first expressions.

It is a reasonable guess that early humans scratched patterns in mud,
daubed their bodies with colour, stuck flowers or feathers in their hair or
danced in complicated patterns as did later peoples - but, if they did, nothing
of that survives. A second difficulty is that we have no knowledge why
the humans who produced the first art which survives took the trouble to
do so. We do not know what they thought they were doing. In later, historical,
times many peoples have painted their faces and bodies, and have
done so for very different reasons. Some may have done this in ancient
times, whether for religious or practical (camouflage) reasons, or as a part
of their sexual culture, whether for pure fun or for its own sake. But what
the ochre was for, we are unlikely ever to know for sure. If archaeologists
thousands of years from now had as evidence of some twentieth - century
societies nothing but a few packets of eye shadow and lipstick tubes, they
would be hard put to it to say what the purpose of these substances might
be.

Nevertheless, from somewhere about 35,000 bc onwards we have a
pretty steady supply of data from Europe. It was produced over a long
period, until about 10,000 bc. Elsewhere, caves and rocks in Africa, for
example, also display lots of prehistoric painting and carving. But so far
nothing as old as European palaeolithic art has been found. Much of what
remains of it comes from a pretty restricted area, a number of sites in
south-western France and northern Spain. The oldest things found there
are little decorated and coloured objects, often of bone and ivory - carved
spear-throwers, for example. Often they have engravings of animals on
them. Then, in about 20,000 bc we begin a period perhaps 5,000 years long
- which has left a splendid series of paintings and carvings on the walls
and roofs of caves. Animals provide most of the subject-matter of these
decorations. The last phase of palaeolithic art follows this - the stag often
looming larger in the subject-matter - and finishes in a burst of decorated
tools and weapons. And then, puzzlingly, this tradition seems to die out
and there is no more really fine art for six thousand years.

This is a very impressive, but also a very mysterious survival. Many
guesses have been made about how it can be explained. The great
sequences of cave pictures have especially interested scholars. For one
thing, these are often put in out-of-the-way and difficult corners, and can
only have been painted or carved with the help of artificial light. Obviously
the huge predominance of animal subjects is important, too: the
palaeolithic artist did not spend his time on landscape or even very much
on human beings. Interestingly, human beings are shown always very
unrealistically, in an abstract, stylized way, whereas the animals are often
drawn with close attention to detail. Perhaps to draw something realistically
was to have power over it. Some scholars have tried to work out
patterns in the way certain animals repeatedly appear, but this does
not get us very far. It is a reasonable guess, though, that in societies without
writing, these patterns carried messages to those who looked at
them. Remembering the hints of burial practices in Neanderthal times.

it is tempting to think that religious or magical rituals went on in these
dark caves. Perhaps, if they did, they were connected with attempts to
influence the movements and behaviour of the game animals on which
early humans depended for their living. This would fit in with there being
more pictures of stags as time passed - the reindeer and mammoth of the
earlier sequences would have gradually died out as the ice slowly
retreated.

We really know very little about the first great art. There is enough of
it, nevertheless, to show that human beings in the late Palaeolithic were
capable of astonishing mental achievements and of observing the world
around them acutely. It may be that as they lost faith in their ability to
influence the behaviour of the animals - which was, though they did not
know it, determined by climate - so they lost the incentive to produce art.
It is unlikely that they practised art for its own sake, far less because
people would buy it, as in later times. But that it was art in the full sense of
careful, controlled, imaginative creation of beautiful and moving things,
appealing to us not only because of what can be done with them but
because of what they are, there can really be no doubt.

THE COMING OF AGRICULTURE
Art has to be paid for even when it is not bought; the people who carried
out the great cave-paintings, however simple their needs, could not go out
to look for food while they were engaged in their work. So some small surpluses over immediate need must have been available even in early hunting and gathering societies. The decisive step in making them bigger was
achieved when people learnt to grow and harvest crops, and to tame and
exploit animals. This was the discovery - or invention - of agriculture. It
must already be clear that the whole story of human beings is one of continual
change, much of it man-made, but some steps in that story stand out
as of quite special importance. Agriculture is one of them, like the mastery
of fire, or the coming of speech. It was almost the last of the great strides
made by mankind in pre-history; it changed life so much and so deeply
that nothing since would have been possible without it.

Different parts of the world achieved agriculture at different times. Climate
and physical setting must be the basic reason, and explain also why
some peoples arrived at agriculture on their own, but much later than the
Old World of Eurasia (in the Americas, for example), and why some never
got there at all without help from the outside (like prehistoric western
Europe). The oldest traces of cultivated plants are said to date from about
10,000 Bc and were found in south-east Asia; these were early forms of
millet and rice, both still important today in that region. About 8,000 years
later, people in central America learnt to grow a kind of sweet potato and
a primitive maize. Much more is known, though, about the early stages of
agriculture in the Near East, where, between about 9000 and 6000 bc many
of the cereal grains we still use became widespread.

The Fertile Crescent
People sometimes call the cracial area ‘the Fertile Crescent ', an arc of territory
running up from the Nile delta, through Palestine and the Levant,
turning eastwards along the hills of Anatolia and finishing on the highlands
between Iran and the Caspian, the other side of the river valleys of
Mesopotamia. Much of it now looks pretty uninviting, but ten thousand
years ago good rainfall and fertile soil made it well-wooded, with its woods
full of game. The growth of forests as the last Ice Age rolled back was less
fierce than further north and they were easier to clear. The ancestors of
later cereals grew on the hills - wild barley, emmer (a wild wheat) and
many grasses. From this area newly discovered techniques of planting and
harvesting seem to have spread, both into south-eastern Europe and into
the Nile valley.

A possible time-scale is that in about 9500 bc people were harvesting
wild grasses and grains in Asia Minor; by 7000 bc the first planting and cultivation
had begun in the Levant and Mesopotamia; in the next three thousand
years these practices moved west as far as (roughly) the Rhine; and
by 3000 BC farming had reached western Europe and the British Isles. Elsewhere
new ways of raising food may have been arrived at independently,
but to the east and north of the Mediterranean they seem to have been
passed on by the neighbours.

Learning how to keep livestock had almost as revolutionary an effect
as growing crops. The dog had already been domesticated by the hunting
peoples of Europe, another big step in harnessing natural energy for
human use. The next was to round up wild animals and keep them in
herds, culling them for food, for their skins and wool, or for their antlers
and bones. There were plenty of animals about in the Fertile Crescent
which turned out to be highly manageable by man. Sheep and goats (or
their ancestors) were especially plentiful there, while pigs of a kind
lived wild almost world-wide. Once the principle of keeping them as
living resources instead of merely hunting them had been grasped, much
else was to follow - milking, for example, or the taking of eggs from
domestic poultry. Later would come the use of animals for riding,
carrying or traction.

The domestication of four animals has provided the backbone of livestock
exploitation ever since - goats, sheep, pigs and cattle. They are all
members of the mammal families of the northern hemisphere and usefully
complement one another. Goats are tough beasts, surviving on poor
pasture, and provide meat, milk, skin and wool. Sheep will live wherever
there is grass (of which there was plenty on the hills of the temperate
zone) and can be used in the same ways as goats. The first traces of someone
keeping sheep come from about 9000 bc in northern Iraq. Pigs provide
meat, will root for their food in woods and forests, grow quickly and have
large and frequent litters. Cattle produce meat, milk and hides, and can
also be used to pull and carry loads. Some of the best evidence of domesticated
animals comes from the bones of those which were eaten in early

agricultural settlements. Nearly always, they are the remains of young
animals, killed before they had reached maturity and therefore culled
from managed herds (the animals killed by hunting peoples were nearly
always full-grown).

Around the cultivation of grains and the herding of animals evolved
agricultural systems. In some parts of the world, though, only a part of the
revolution took place. When the inhabitants of Central America took to
growing crops, they did not go on to domesticate animals, probably
because few suitable ones were available until introduced far later by the
followers of Columbus. Only in the Andes, where the llama provided an
all-purpose meat, milk and wool producer, as well as a bearer of burdens,
were the skills of the herdsman mastered. Isolation, therefore, soon began
to differentiate life in the Americas and in the Old World land masses. But
within the Old World, too, difficulties of communication may explain big
differences in the way agriculture developed. It seems likely, for instance,
that whereas knowledge and crops spread fairly easily from the Near East
through North Africa to western Europe, and even, slightly less easily, up
the Danube valley, their movement eastwards into Asia was much harder.
Furthermore, big climatic differences stood in the way of doing the same
thing there. One result was that when China came to be an agricultural
country, crops which suited local conditions were derived from local
plants and were not imported as had been grains to Europe from the Near
East. The outstanding example was rice which, interestingly, does not
really need animals in its cultivation, but huge inputs of human labour.
This may be an explanation why the only animal the Chinese bred for
eating was the pig, though various cattle were later used for work. But
archaeologists are still much divided and uncertain about the origins of
agriculture in China, so that it is best not to be dogmatic.

A changing world
The revolution in the conditions of human life launched by the coming of
agriculture took thousands of years. Early agricultural settlements were
short-lived; the first farmers were still probably pretty mobile cultivators,
likely to practise what is called ‘slash-and-burn’ agriculture, something
still seen among primitive peoples. An area of forest is chosen (the soil is
likely to be good because of accumulated leaf-mould and decayed rubbish)
and the trees are killed by ringing them. Then they are burnt, the stumps
removed where possible, and crops are planted among the roots. After a
few years undergrowth again becomes too thick or perhaps the soil is
exhausted, and so another site has to be chosen. This was for a long time
all the farming that could be done. People knew no better ways of tilling
the soil, and it was very difficult to clear ground with stone tools and antler
picks. As the centuries went by, though, fields appeared in some places as
a result of continuous reoccupation and recultivation; when this happened,
the early farmers began to be more tied down in one place - they
became sedentary, as the anthropologists put it. Because archaeologists

have uncovered many of these early places, this was one of the first effects
of agriculture on human behaviour which we know about.
As for the effect on the non-human environment, ancient vegetables
and crops would have looked very different from ours. Those we now use
are much bigger; sometimes they differ from wild varieties in shape,
colour and size because humans have intervened in the evolutionary
process. By choosing some strains for cultivation and rejecting others,
humans began at an early date to alter the balance of nature, which would
have produced a very different selection had not human choice cut across
it.

The most important of the new crops were all grains or seeds. Leaf,
root and bulb crops could be cultivated and some soon were, but wheat and
barley, peas and lentils all kept much better. Once dried, they could be
stored. They could thus provide food for the winter and for bad years,
when crops failed. This was another liberation from the rigidities of natural
rhythms; though not complete - for sowing and harvesting made their
own, new, demands - it was another step toward that freedom to do something
else than merely hunt for enough nourishment to survive which had
begun with meat-eating hominids so long ago.

The effects of human decision would have shown among animals, too.
The first domesticated sheep and pigs must have been much smaller,
scraggier beasts than the prosperous-looking, square-fleeced creatures
nibbling English hillsides, or the pink monsters dozing in our pigsties. Nor
have there been changes merely in size. In most domesticated animals
(and birds) the muzzle has got shorter; as humans have assured their food 
supply, strains with less-well-developed teeth and jaws than are needed in
the wilds have been able to survive. Modern animals may even be less
' brainy ' than their wild ancestors; because they have been protected by
man from so many natural enemies and dangers, strains have been able to
survive in which some parts of the brain handling messages from the outside
world remain somewhat under-developed. More striking still, the
colour of animals becomes less uniform as they are domesticated; this is
because removal from their natural habitat enables varieties to survive
which might have perished in the wild because of the hazard presented by
their colouring.

What we cannot know is how far or when humans began to try to produce
such changes as these. We are now used to the idea that sheep with
heavier fleeces, or cows with better milk yields, can be bred selectively,
but to begin with there must have been a great deal of accident involved.
The first reasons for intervention with natural selection may also have
been different from those which would now operate. An early herdsman
might, for example, have chosen to breed animals because of markings
which pleased him or which could easily be recognized. We simply do not
know.
The most important result of the new methods and, indeed, of any
agriculture at all, is clear enough, though: much more food became


available. Veiy much depends on the kind of game, plants and soil, but a
human family in a society dependent on gathering and hunting for its food
has to have hundreds of acres at its disposal in order to get enough, while
even with primitive agriculture about twenty-five acres will do. This was
the result of the first big jump in food production. What has happened
since may make it look tiny, but the coming of agriculture brought the first
dramatic increase in the human food supply after hunting, and one of
even greater potential.

More plentiful food brought a rise in human numbers; if there was
more to eat, then more mouths would survive to eat it. We cannot make
very good estimates, but all the signs of what it meant can be read by
archaeologists in the remains of the bigger settlements themselves - the
first villages. Their appearance makes us fairly certain that other changes
in social life were going on, too. Continuous occupation of the same settlement
became more normal; there was less need to follow game or seasonal
plants about. As this happened, buildings of greater solidity appear.
One famous example is Jericho, where already before 9000 bc there was a
village on the site of a never-failing spring. A thousand years later it had
grown in size until its mud-brick houses covered eight or nine acres and
had big walls round them. The inhabitants clearly felt they had something
to protect and possible enemies to protect it from. They owned wealth,
and human beings had already discovered that one quick way to acquire it
was to take it from those who had it already.

In such places as Jericho new patterns of life gradually emerged as such
communities grappled more and more successfully with the special
demands and opportunities of their environment. This was not what had
happened after earlier Ice Ages when there had been no animal as
resourceful as Homo sapiens to take advantage of what they left behind.
Since, though, for a long time there were not many people in the world, the
communities they lived in tended long to remain isolated from one
another. Then, as they evolved new skills and met new challenges in their
own settings, they grew apart in their ways of living, in what we may call
their cultures, which became more and more complicated. People raised in
them must always have taken them for granted (as most people in the
world still take their own ways for granted). The importance of routine
ways of doing things must have seemed overwhelming if the community
was to continue and so for a long time different cultures continued to draw
apart. No doubt language took different forms as it had to meet different
needs. Even today, many different languages can still be found side-by-side
in areas which are still primitive. Almost every tribe has its own, meeting
its own precise needs. Great worldwide languages such as modern English
or Spanish only appear at a very late date and are the result of civilization.

Such differences offset the fact that all these communities still lived in
what we should think a very similar way. They all rested on a very simple
technology, though one much more elaborate than anything available
even a few thousand years earlier. It was also of immense potential for

generating further, and faster, change, as the next distinguishable phase of
humanity's evolution was to show.

THE NEOLITHIC REVOLUTION

The word ' Neolithic ', like ‘ Palaeolithic ’, has an ending which suggests a
connexion with stone. People have sometimes wished to distinguish
phases within the 'Stone Age'. They came to speak ofboth a ' Mesolithic ' era
and a 'Neolithic' era. Like all other divisions of prehistory these eras begin
and end at different times in different places and are not marked by
sudden changes. People did not wake up one morning and suddenly find
they were in a different era; what happened was that their ways of doing
things (particularly of making certain tools from stone, which is the easiest
thing for archaeologists to observe) gradually changed. The end-result
was clear enough, although there had never been a precise moment at
which one could say the change took place. This is the way societies,
which are complicated things, still change, even though they now do so
rather faster. The Mesolithic really does not matter much for our purposes,
interesting and important as it is to specialists. The Neolithic, on the other
hand, marks a very important phase of human development indeed.

Why is this? After all, in its strict sense, archaeologists only use the
word 'Neolithic' to denote a culture in which ground and polished stone
implements replace those made by flaking or chipping. This does not by
itself seem enormously exciting. Much more is involved. The Neolithic
phase of human existence also brought about a number of other changes
of huge importance going far beyond the ways of using stone which are its
convenient markers. Nearly all of them, though they might have their
roots in the distant past, could only take place on a large scale and over a
wide area because of the earlier discovery of agriculture. It made possible
the bundle of developments which have been called the ‘ Neolithic revolution ’
and which should only be separated into distinct elements for convenience
in describing them. All human societies are tied together in
complicated ways; each part only operates and develops in the way it does
because the other parts are there too. There is no pressing reason to
describe any one particular change as crucial, once we have recognized
the enormous importance of the provision of more food by agriculture. Let
us therefore start at an obvious, if arbitrarily chosen, point, the stone technology
which gives the era its name.

Technological change
For tens of thousands of years heavy cutting was done with hand-axes,
stone choppers held in the fist, their edges sharpened by chipping flakes
away. The Neolithic tools were still of stone, but were smoother, with blades
ground and polished on other, harder, stones. Moreover, blades came to be
set in hafts. This greatly increased the energy going into a cutting-power
already improved by shape and polish. Some Neolithic stone axes have

been fitted with modern hafts and have been tried out on woodland;
they are formidable instruments, with a long life, because when blunted
they can be given a fresh edge by the grinding process which produced
them in the first place. Here was a tool of great importance to agriculture. It
made easier the clearing of woods, brush and scrub for crop-growing. Stone
hoes for breaking the ground followed. A change in stone technology, that
is to say, is closely connected with the food-producing revolution. We do
not know exactly the sequence of causes and effects, but a connexion is
obvious

Many such connexions between different changes in human life during
the Neolithic era justify its claim to be crucial in the story of mankind. It
took five or six thousand years for them all to be worked out, and the overall
effect was the greatest acceleration of economic and social development
before the coming of steam-power in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
AD. Not only could more people be fed, but more could be fed without
themselves taking part in the raising and bringing in of food. There may
have been a few specialists in earlier times but economic and technical
specialism became both more likely and much easier with the invention of
agriculture. Inside bigger and settled communities more craftsmen carried
out tasks for which others gave them their livelihood - making tools, or decorative
objects, for example. Some of their activities were of great importance
in bringing about both new differences between the way life was
lived by different individuals and new technical discoveries

One such was pottery. It may have been first made in Japan in about
10,000 Bc, but it was widespread in the Fertile Crescent a couple of thousand
years later. Bowls and containers of wood and perhaps of stone had
already been used in earlier times. With agriculture and foods which could
be stored they became more necessary. Someone observed (perhaps by
accident) that firing clay could change its nature. That meant that containers
could be made much more quickly and easily. In its turn, this made it
easier to cook in different ways (and therefore to enlarge still further the
range of human foods) as well as to store food (and therefore to make an
assured supply a little less of a problem). Moreover, pottery could be decorated
easily, both by daubing it with colour and by changing its shape, and
so offered a new medium for art, though for a long time it was pretty crude.
All this adds up, therefore, to a wide-ranging series of effects. Woven fabric
was another Neolithic invention. Humans had worn skins for thousands of
years and, at their best, their clothes must have looked like those still worn
in the last century by North American Indians, or by Esquimaux in this
(both can until recently be regarded as Stone Age peoples). But in Neolithic
times, the first woven materials - textiles - appeared in the Near East.

Farming, pottery, textiles: these alone imply vast changes within a few
thousand years. It is, in fact, nothing less than the preparation of the nursery
for the next phase of human development, the one we still live in, the
era of civilization. Nor are these all the changes we can associate with the
Neolithic. One more, overlapping into the age of civilization (and this is

why some scholars do not count it as part of the Neolithic), was the discovery
of how to use metal.
The coming of metallurgy
In the long run, metal-using changed the human world almost as much as
farming. The change came more gradually, though, and is much less easy
to pin down, because many other things had to happen before its full
effects could be felt. There was not for a long time much ore available,
even when people had found out how to treat it, and the early use of metal
was only occasional and scattered, and not very influential. Nonetheless,
the earliest traces fall well within the Neolithic era. At some time between
7000 and 6000 bc, copper, the first metal to be exploited, was in use at a site
in Anatolia, a region where the ore was fairly easily found. Cyprus and
some of the Aegean islands also provided it. The evidence shows copper 
using spreading gradually westwards into the Mediterranean basin as time
passes, then in Italy and Hungary on the mainland, as well as in the British
Isles.

Early copper was worked by hammering. This was only possible with
very pure ores. The next step was to cast it - that is to say, to heat it until
it became liquid and then pour it into moulds. Finally came the discovery
that impure ore could be refined (again by heat) to provide purer metal.
Once these processes were known, metallurgy had its basic pattern set for
thousands of years. Development went on by finding new sources of ore,
by experimenting with them and discovering different metals, by specializing
them for certain purposes, by providing greater heat to work and
refine them and by blending metals to make artificial materials - alloys
would be our word

The first alloy seems to have been bronze, a blend of tin and copper;
about one part of tin in ten of copper is plenty for good bronze. It was so
important that it has given its name to the Bronze Age. For a long time it
was thought that bronze was first made and used in Mesopotamia somewhere
shortly before 3000 bc. It was known also that it was made in China
about a thousand years later than this. But recently, bronze objects found
in north-eastern Thailand have been dated as early as 3600 bc, earlier than
any others. No doubt more evidence will be needed before scholars agree
which ancient society was the first to use bronze. The chief point is that
the Bronze Age was the phase of human society during which its main
metal requirements were met by the use of this alloy, one much superior
to copper. It could be given (and would keep) a much better cutting edge
(copper was not even as good as flint in this respect) and it could be cast in
moulds much more easily and so more easily varied in shape. Its discovery,
of course, made places where tin could be found important, too; sometimes
these were in the same areas as copper deposits.

How progress was made we do not know. Possibly someone noticed
that copper left in an oven used for baking pottery melted - and so could
be moulded. Technology has always advanced because of ' spin-off '; the

by-products of one advance are the major steps in another. Modem nonstick
frying-pans make use of knowledge about heat-resisting materials
developed for building space rockets. Once spin-off is noted, specialists
then begin to experiment with the result, and further spin-off can follow.
Some scholars have recently argued that the process of refining ore was
not discovered accidentally, but that it was the outcome of what we might
now call ‘research’ and conscious experiment. If so, it is clear evidence of
how deliberately, by the Neolithic era, humans were change-makers.

Gold, too, was discovered and used at an early date. It was probably
more easily available in the ancient world in deposits near the surface
than in later times. Its use, though, was almost purely decorative; copper
had been turned into ornaments, but had soon been put to use for weapons
and tools. This was not possible with gold.

Even bronze was less important for weapons and tools than iron,
whose exploitation is hardly part of prehistory at all. It made its appearance
only after the first civilizations were already well established and was
widely used only after 1000 bc, a very late date. All users of iron have lived
since civilization began, even if they themselves were not civilized, and
therefore, in the era we usually think of as historical, not prehistorical. But
it is logical to discuss iron here, because its coming is really the completion
of the story of metallurgy in early times. Prehistorians still talk of the 'Iron
Age' and of‘Iron Age cultures’ too; it is another phrase which describes not
an era of time but a phase of material culture. The Iron Age can be thought
of as both the culmination and the ending of the Neolithic era, though
iron-using peoples long lived alongside others using only stone tools

It is usually agreed that iron-working, like the working of copper, began
in Asia Minor, and there is much disagreement about exactly where. No
doubt a start in that part of the world is to be explained not only by the
presence of the raw material, but also by growing experience in working
other metals. For refining, iron has to be heated to a much higher temperature
than copper. People in Anatolia already knew how to make ovens hot
enough for pottery to bake in them by firing them with charcoal and blowing
air through them. Even so, they could not reach a high enough temperature
to cast iron in moulds, like copper and bronze. For a long time,
iron could only be made by beating it into shape - it could be ‘ wrought ’, but
not ‘ cast ’.

Iron-making spread rapidly. Europeans later called Celts were among
the finest iron-workers (they had been very good at bronze, too, though in
that skill the Chinese long led the field) but only well after iron was
adopted elsewhere. The first people who much used it were Anatolians
called Hittites who ruled a large empire in the Near East in about 1500 bc
and were to show that military victory was much easier for those who had
iron weapons. An iron sword was much tougher than a bronze one - let
alone a copper dagger or stone axe. But iron changed history more through
its application to agriculture. Iron tools were better than anything else for
tilling the soil. They meant easier and deeper digging and therefore more

food still. Better crops followed, and so did the use of plants which needed
deeper rooting. Tree-felling became easier. Nevertheless, the impact of
iron was very slow and for a long time very expensive. Only a hundred
years ago wooden ploughs were the rule in Russia and millions of them are
sti at work all over the world.

Wood-working was transformed by metal. Even copper and bronze
tools had already made possible work of a level we can reasonably term
' carpentry '; iron brought another stride forward. It gave people more
objects to use and enjoy and it made likely even more specialization of
skills. The importance of ore-bearing areas steadily grew. Once into the
age of civilization, Europe's landmass would be more important to the outside
world than ever before because of it and the interest of outsiders
would increase. The European peoples were for a long time backward by
comparison with those elsewhere, but their continent was full of easily
available ores and thick forests left by the retiring ice which could provide
fuel. Metal-seeking prospectors from the Near East were begining to look
there well before 3000 bc and a thousand years later several specialized
metallurgical regions existed, notably in Spain, Greece and central Italy.
Soon, Europe would be a major manufacturing area as well as a producer
of ores. Metallurgy had some bad environmental effects, too. The stripping
of timber reserves probably began not with the clearing of ground for agriculture,
but with the felling of trees to provide charcoal for smelting
metals. But this story takes us too far ahead for an account of pre-history.
It is the beginning of a huge theme - the slowly unrolling story of the way
in which Europe rose in the end to a world dominance owing much to the
exploitation of her mineral and technological resources.

AT THE EDGE OF HISTORY
Most animals which live in groups - ants, bees, herds of deer - look very
well-regulated. It seems that they are better at keeping rules in their societies
than are human beings. Yet that is only because they are in fact very
different from humans. They are not actually obeying rules (as we understand
them) at all, but are behaving almost automatically; they do things
because they are programmed by their genes or by patterns of behaviour
imprinted so deep that we call them ‘instincts'. They could not behave
otherwise if they wanted to, indeed, they cannot want to.
This is not how human societies work. They have to take account of
basic human nature, its needs and drives, but they provide many different
ways of doing so and these ways have often been deliberately chosen
by their members. Right round the world, for example, men and women
are sexually attracted to one another, live together and have children. But
there are many different sets of rules about the ways in which they may
do this and these rules are made by humans, not by nature. In England
the law will not allow you to have more than one wife or husband at the
same time, whereas in some countries it is legal to do so. Or, to take a

quite different example, in much of Europe a few hundred years ago, it
was not possible to follow certain trades.(being a shoemaker, for instance)
without belonging to a special guild of those who practised that trade and
being regulated by its rules about how you did your work. For various reasons
this system crumbled away and for much of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries there were fewer legal restraints on following the trade
you wanted and working at it as you pleased. But in some countries it was
for a long time difficult to do certain jobs without belonging to the appropriate
trade union. This does not at first sight have much to do with prehistory,
but it should direct our attention to the fact that what we call
‘ social institutions ’ - ways of organizing people to do things - are to some
extent matters of choice for different societies, and that they will vary a
lot from one society to another. This was true even in early times.

Differences in traditional ways of making things show that some
human communities had become very distinct already at the end of prehistoric
times. The carving out of their own traditions had begun a long
way back in the palaeolithic. But differences became much sharper with
settlement and that, of course, was another result of the coming of agriculture.
High up the valley of one of the tributaries of the Tigris, in the
Kurdish hills, there was by 6500 bc a little village at a place called Jarmo.
Its people did not yet know how to fire pottery, but they already had
houses of clay, sometimes with stone foundations and more than one
room. Some of their dwellings had built-in furniture, such as ovens, or
basins in the floor. The inhabitants could cut and grind bowls from smooth
stone and also made from it ornaments such as beads and bracelets. They
practised agriculture and had domesticated sheep, goats, oxen, pigs and, of
course, dogs. Already at Jarmo a little wealth marked off some - the
owners of prized ornaments or weapons - from others. There was a role
for specialists in such a place. Its affairs had to be regulated and the harvesting
and storing of crops seen to. Yet Jarmo probably only contained a
couple of hundred people. Far to the west, in Palestine, Jericho probably
had about three thousand inhabitants by that time. So hig a group, to say
nothing of the problems of managing and retaining control of an important
oasis, would have made specialized skills and ordered government
much more necessary than in Jarmo. One of the things which was happening 
at least in the Near East during the Neolithic, then, was that bigger
groups were evolving to which people gave loyalty and obedience. Human
life was already well down the road away from the nomadic tribe to the
organization of human social life in settled territorial units under the same
laws which is the way of governing people we are familiar with today.

How men and women saw one another’s roles in these early societies
is still hidden from us, but must have been rooted in biological and economic
facts already mentioned. Because human infants - the future of the
tribe - require so much prolonged care, the division of labour between the
sexes, whereby men went out to hunt and gather food while women stayed
at the home base, was probably well-established before communities


became more settled. On this division would grow different traditions of
education, the boys going about more with the men as they grew to be able
to keep up (or at least not to be a nuisance) in the hunt, while women may
have learnt to observe carefully the plant life near at hand to the base, to
gather in it specially useful and nutritive crops. Perhaps in many places
they already provided the main labour force for agriculture - as they still
do today. Before we reach the age of history, we can be sure that much of
what was to be taken for granted for thousands of years, and was to endure
until the present, was already in place.

5000 Bc has no special merit as a date except that it is easily remembered,
but it will do as an imaginary point of vantage. By then, the physical
shape of the world was very nearly what it is today. The forms of
continents, natural barriers and natural channels of communication have
not changed much since. Climate, too (since seven thousand years are
hardly significant in comparison with the upheavals of the hundreds of
millenia before the last Ice Age) can be regarded as stabilized; only short term
fluctuations need concern historians in what follows. Ahead lay the
age (in which we still live) in which most change was to be man-made

Some parts of the world were by 5000 bc already well into the Neolithic
era; human life was thus already very diverse and complicated. It was quite
unlike the life of Homo erectus, which, for all its great advances, had still
been very much the same everywhere. Yet Homo erectus had himself lived a
life very different from that of the poor, vulnerable specimens of Australopithecus
who crouched about the lake v/hich filled what is now the Olduvai
gorge 2 million years ago, armed with means of survival hardly better than
the beasts prowling nearby with whom they shared their food-supply

By Neolithic times we are in a world full of human variety and potential.
This variety was to increase. Some human communities were to
progress rapidly; some would not. New forces would operate in human
development as different peoples came into contact and learnt from one
another, or reflected further on their own experience and plunged forward
into new experiments. More and more, that is to say, human diversity
could stem from mankind’s ability to change things consciously as well as
from the brute facts of environment. The result would be more untidy still;
there have hardly ever been such possibilities of differences of human
experience as exist in the world today. But, it was already far from uniform
in 5000 BC. There is no clear line marking off the end of one human era
from another, only a blurred, ragged-edged time zone, with some people
forging ahead on their way to civilization and others still stuck firmly in the
Stone Age where some of them were to remain for thousands of years yet.

Yet this was a world where there had already been an enormous acceleration
of change. It had begun far back in prehistory and it is important to
get the perspective right. Someone alive today, who recalls that the aeroplane
did not exist in 1900, that nuclear power is only fifty years or so old,
that many African nations had not been invented forty years ago, and that
AIDS was only identified as a disease in the 1980s, may well be excused the

feeling that for centuries on end not much changed in, say, the Middle
Ages. Over much of Europe people were still farming in the fifteenth century,
for example, in the way they did in the ninth. Yet if we look at European
art - at buildings, say - in ad 800 and then five hundred years later,
it is obvious that there has been a very big change indeed. In the first art of
all, though, that of the upper Palaeolithic, experts tell us that the great
cave-decorations show virtually no stylistic change for perhaps five or six
thousand years. And if we were to go further back, the long persistence of
certain ways of making tools from stone would give us examples of even
more gradual development. In even earlier times, the actual physiological
evolution of human beings can be observed, but had been of glacier-like
slowness by comparison even with the sometimes barely perceptible
changes of palaeolithic art.

The crucial reason why change had already speeded up a lot by 5000 bc
is that by then the main source of innovation had moved from natural
forces to human beings themselves. By the end of prehistory the human
story is increasingly one of choice. Human beings are making more and
more decisions to act and adapt in certain ways to meet their problems and
to develop certain ways of doing things, to utilise certain materials or
skills.. This is why what we can reckon the most important change of all
came about somewhere right at the beginning, though we cannot exactly
know when or where, when some creature perhaps hardly recognisable to
us as human, first began to think of the world as a collection of separate
objects distinct from himself. If we knew when it was, it might serve as the
best definition of the beginning of the prehistory of man; it opened the
way to using the world, and that is the story of the whole change from life
shaped blindly by nature to one shaped by human culture and tradition.
After that, something like compound interest began to work. As more and
more human beings appeared, there was not only a bigger pool of talent to
draw upon but there was also more and more human achievement and
experience to use. Even small communities did not have to go through the
tedious business of learning everything from scratch

As we know only too well, this has not meant that human beings have
not created new problems as fast as they solved old ones, nor that the story
of mankind is not full of slippings backward and tragic failures too. But it
helps to emphasize a central fact about human beings as they approached
the era when some of them were to create the first civilizations - that they
are unique in consciously setting about using and changing the world. One
of the few good descriptions of Homo sapiens is that he is, above all, a
change-making animal. The evidence of that lies in what he has done - his
history. Behind it lies all that has been only glanced at so far in this book,
millions of years in which creatures were taking shape in ways which
decided that among the primates, human beings alone were formed as
creatures which could mould their own destinies. Even if for a long time
they could only do so within narrow limits, the earliest evidence of the
effect of that is very ancient.


The Earliest
Civilizations
THE ROOTS OF CIVILIZATION

Some people argue that, even if we agree about who they were, what was
done by the first humans is not really history at all. They point out that we
can really only begin to understand people and write real history when we
have evidence which can give us a fairly good idea of what they thought.
In practice, we have to have, and to understand, words. ' History ' as the
story of the human past cannot, therefore, go back much further than the
first writing. TWo Chinese characters are claimed to have been found
which date from as early as 5500 bc, but the first writing we can be sure
about was invented between 3500 and 3000 bc. Within a few hundred
years, written records in the form of inscriptions on stone or clay tablets
were being made. Swollen vastly in due course by papyrus, parchment and
paper, a growing flood of written documents thereafter gives us evidence
about the era during which all the most striking and rapid changes in the
way people live have occurred. Human life has been transformed in the
last five thousand years and that, say some scholars, is what ' history ' is
about. It is the era of written record.

Traditionally, what happened before writing is called ' pre-history ', and
historians have left it to other scholars. Non-documentary evidence was all
that could be used to find out about it. Yet in prehistory much was settled
to ensure that one day humans would know how to write - as well as engineer,
build, organize and many other things. Though so much has happened
so recently (in the last 5,000 years or so), it did not start happening
without any preparation. In sheer weight of years most of the story of
human beings lies in prehistoric times, and that is why we have begun
there. In looking at the beginnings of civilized life, we have to start with
what lies behind it.
i
What our ancestors brought with them into the era of civilization was
very important in shaping what the entities we call civilizations were
going to be like. If people had not already discovered how to make clothes.

they would simply have been unable to live on much of the globe's surface
which is now inhabited. The adoption of clothing, with all that followed,
from the introduction of sewing and weaving, down to the invention of
special materials for space-travel, is one sign of the human capacity to
adapt to different environments. All sorts of other things might have been
different without it; signals of sexual identity for instance. But there is no
need to speculate about such matters; the main point is simple enough.
Without their inheritance from the past, the first human communities
which produced civilization would not have been able to do so. Some, in
fact, never did, and had to wait for civilization to come to them from outside.

To settle what constitutes a ‘ civilization ’ is a little like pinning down in
time the first human beings. There is a shaded area in which we know a
shift occurs, and we can agree about when a line has been crossed; but to
look for exact dates is pointless. All over the Near East around 5000 bc
farming villages could provide agricultural surpluses. Some of these little
settlements had complex religious practices and could make elaborate
painted pottery, already a widespread art in the Neolithic era. But by
civilization we usually mean something more than the presence of ritual,
art or a certain technology, and certainly something more than the
mere agglomeration of human beings in the same place, though scale is
important. It is best to start with what people have been able to agree
about.


THE FIRST CIVILIZATIONS

The first civilizations emerged between 3500 bc and 500 bc. They begin
the age in which all significant change to human life has been man-made.
In them can be sought foundations of our own world; they still determine
much of the cultural map of the world even today. They were the outcome
of particular mixes of human skills and natural facts which came together
and in each case made possible a new order of life based on the exploitation
of nature. Though the earliest civilizations all appeared within a few
thousand years - barely a moment on the vast scale of prehistory - they
were neither simultaneous, nor equally successful. Some of them raced
ahead to lasting achievements while others declined or disappeared, even
after spectacular flowerings. Yet all of them showed an increase in the rate
and scale of change dramatic by comparison with anything achieved in
earlier times.

A rough chronology begins about 3500 bc in Mesopotamia, when the
first acknowledged civilization becomes visible there. In Egypt, civilized
life appears at a later but still early date, perhaps about 3100 bc. In Crete,
by about 2000 bc, we have another marker in what is called Minoan civilization.
From that time we can disregard questions of priorities in the
eastern Mediterranean and Near East: it was already by then a region
where a complex of civilizations influenced and interplayed with one

another. Meanwhile perhaps by 2500 bc, civilization had emerged in India;
China's starts later, towards the middle of the second millennium bc, and
it is a sufficiently isolated example to show that interaction does not have
to be a big part of explaining what happens. From that time, except in Central
and South America, there are no civilizations to be explained which
appear without external stimulus, shock or inheritance from others
already mature.
It is not easy to see much that the first civilizations had in common
except their complete dependence on local agriculture, their achievement
of writing, and their organization of society on a new scale in cities. Even
if their technology was advanced by comparison with that of their uncivilized
predecessors, they still all worked with little beyond rhuscle power,
animal and human, to carry out their material purposes, and their shape
and development were still determined very much by their setting. Yet
they had begun to nibble at the restraints of geography and had a growing
ability to exploit and overcome them. The currents of wind and water
which directed early maritime travel are still there today; even in the

second millennium bc men were learning to put them to use. This meant
that at a very early date the possibilities of human interchange were
already considerably greater than in prehistoric times.

This makes it rash to dogmatize about origins or why civilizations
arose in the first place. Civilization did not appear in any standard way. No
doubt it was likely always to result from the coming together of a number
of factors predisposing a particular area to throw up something dense
enough to be recognized later as civilization, but we do not know what catalysts
or detonators were at work to speed up the process. Different environments,
different influences from outside and different cultural
inheritances from the past meant that humanity did not move everywhere
at the same pace towards the same outcome. A favourable geographical
setting was essential, but culture was important, too. Peoples had to be
able to take advantage of an environment, to rise to challenges. River valleys
like those of Mesopotamia, the Indus valley, China and Egypt were
obviously favourable settings; their rich and easily cultivated lands could
support fairly dense populations of farmers in villages which would then
grow to form the first towns. But civilizations have also appeared in very
different settings, in meso-America, Minoan Crete and in Greece. Tb the
last two, we know important influences came from the outside, but Egypt
and the Indus valley were at least in touch with Mesopotamia at very early
dates. External contacts maybe important even in China, almost insulated
from the outside world though it seems at first sight. People used to argue
that we should look for one central source of civilization from which all
others came. But there is not only the awkward case of isolated civilizations
in the Americas to deal with; it is also very hard to get the timetable
of the supposed diffusion to fit as radio-carbon dating improves our knowledge
of early chronology.

It is easier, in fact, to recognize early civilization when it is in place than
to know how it came to be there, and about the exact process no absolute
and universal statements can plausibly be made. Civilization is the name
we give to the interaction of human beings in a very creative way, when, as
it were, a critical mass of cultural potential and material resources has
been built up, and human capacities are released for development
which becomes in large measure self-sustaining. It brings together the
co-operative efforts of more people than hitherto, usually by bringing them
together physically in larger masses, too. ' Civilization ' is a word connected
with a Latin word meaning ' city '. More than any other institution the city
has provided the critical mass required and it has fostered innovation
better than any other environment so far. Inside the first cities the wealth
produced by agriculture was used for the upkeep of priestly classes which
elaborated complex religious structures and encouraged the construction
of great buildings with more than merely economic functions. Much bigger
resources than in earlier times were thus allocated to something other than
immediate consumption. The result, as writing became available, was a
new and intensive storing of enterprise and experience. The accumulated

culture gradually became more and more effective as an instrument with
which to change the world.
With the coming of civilization, peoples in different parts of the world
grew more rapidly unlike one another. The most obvious fact about early
civilizations is their startling variety of style, but because it is so obvious
we usually overlook it. The coming of civilization brings growing and
faster differentiation in dress, architecture, technology, behaviour, social
forms and thought. Prehistory no doubt threw up societies with different
life-styles, different routines, different mentalities, as well as different
physical characteristics, but the lack of wealth and specialized technology
limited the range of differences. With the first civilizations differentiation
becomes much more obvious, and it is the product of the creative power of
civilization itself. From the first civilizations to our own day there have
always been alternative and potentially stimulating and fertilizing models
of human society existing at the same time, however much or little they
knew of one another. Much of this new potential for variety is now very
hard to recover, because we have still so little evidence in the earliest
stages of civilization about the life of the mind except institutions (so far as
we can understand them), the conscious symbols and unconscious statements
of art, and the ideas embodied in literature.
The interplay of Culture in the Fertile Crescent
The mutually stimulating interactions of different cultures first become
obvious in the Near East. A turmoil of racial comings and goings for three
or four thousand years both enriched and disrupted the Fertile Crescent.
It was to be for most of historic times a great crucible of cultures, a zone
not only of settlement but of transit, through which poured people
exchanging ideas, institutions, languages and beliefs, many of which still
influence us today.
The root cause of the wanderings of peoples was probably over-population
in their homelands. Yet the world's population in about 4000 bc has
been estimated only at between eighty and ninety millions. In the next
four thousand years it was to grow by about fifty per cent to about one
hundred and thirty millions; this increase is at a rate tiny by comparison
with what came later. It shows the relative slowness with which men
added to their power to exploit the natural world. Yet it marks a huge
demographic break with prehistoric times and it rested on a very fragile
margin of resources. Drought or desiccation could dramatically and suddenly
destroy an area's food supplies. The immediate results must often
have been the threat of famine, one of the prime movers of early history.
For thousands of years food could not easily be moved about, except on
the hoof Droughts, catastrophic storms, even a few years of marginally
lower or higher temperatures, could force peoples to get on the move and
so threw together different traditions. In collision and cooperation they
learnt from one another and the potential of their societies thus
increased.

Linguistic differences provide distinctions among the peoples of early
civilized times in the Fertile Crescent. They can all be assigned either to
stocks which evolved in Africa north and north-east of the Sahara (called
' Hamitic '), to the ‘Semites' of the Arabian peninsula, to the ‘ Indo-Europeans ' 
who, from southern Russia, had spread also by 4000 bc into Europe
and Iran, or to what may be termed ‘Caucasian' from Georgia and the
Caucasus region. In about 4000 bc most of the Fertile Crescent seems to
have been occupied by the last. They are the main protagonists of the earliest
Near Eastern history. But by then Semitic peoples, too, already began
to penetrate the region; in the middle of the third millennium bc they
were well established in central Mesopotamia, across the middle reaches
of the Tigris and Euphrates. The interplay and rivalry of the Semitic
peoples with the Caucasians, who were able to hang on to the higher
lands which enclosed Mesopotamia from the north-east, is a continuing
theme in the early history of the area. By 2000 bc other peoples whose
languages form part of what is called the ' Indo-European ' group have also
entered on the scene. One of them, the Hittites, pushed into Anatolia
from Europe, while their advance was matched from the east by that of
another, the Iranians. Between 2000 bc and 1500 bc branches of these subunits
disputed and mingled with the Semitic and Caucasian peoples in the
Crescent itself, while the interplay of Hamites and Semites lies behind
much of the political history of old Egypt. This confused scenario is, of
course, highly impressionistic and its detail uncertain. None the less,
whatever its exact nature and cause, wanderings of peoples within this
general pattern are the background against which the first civilization
appeared and prospered.


Sumer
It did so in the southern part of Mesopotamia, an ancient Greek name for
what is now Iraq. In this seven-hundred-mile-long land formed by the
river valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates human beings had long lived in
some numbers, and in Neolithic times it was thickly studded with farming
villages. Some of the oldest settlements of all seem to have been in the
extreme south. Southern Mesopotamia then joined the sea about a hundred
miles north of the point at which it does today and centuries of
drainage by the two great rivers from up-country and annual floodings had
built up a soil of great richness in the areas round the deltas. Crops would
grow easily if water was continuously and safely available; this was usually
possible, for though rain was slight and irregular, the river-bed was
sometimes above the level of nearby land. Here, at an early date, was the
possibility of growing more than was needed for daily consumption, the
surplu? allowing the appearance of town life. Furthermore, fish could be
taken from the nearby sea.
This setting was both a challenge and an opportunity. The Tigris and
Euphrates could suddenly and violently change course: the marshy,
low-lying land of the delta had therefore to be managed by banking and


ditching and canals had to be built to carry water away. Techniques like
those first employed to form the platforms of reed and mud on which
were built the first homesteads of Mesopotamia could still be seen in use
there even in this century. Patches of cultivation would be grouped where
the soil was richest and the drains and irrigation channels they needed
could only be managed properly if they were managed collectively. No
doubt the social organization of reclamation was a consequence, and with
it went some kind of legitimized authority. However it happened, the
seemingly unprecedented achievement of making land from watery
marsh must have been the forcing house for a new complexity in the way
Mesopotamians lived together.
As their numbers grew, more land was taken to grow food. Sooner or
later men of different villages would come face to face with others intent
on reclaiming marsh which had previously separated them from one
another. Different irrigation needs may even have brought them into contact
before this. There was likely to be a choice: fight or cooperate. Somewhere
along this path it made sense for men to band together in bigger
groups for self-protection as well as management of the environment.
One physical result was the town. Mud-walled at first to keep out
floods and enemies, then raised above the waters on a platform, it was
logical for the local deity’s shrine to be the place chosen for a larger
settlement; he stood behind the community's authority, which would
be exercised by his chief priest, who became the manager of a little
theocracy competing with others.
Something like this explains the difference between southern
Mesopotamia in the third and fourth millennia bc and the other zones of
Neolithic culture with which by then it was in contact. Mesopotamia and
Neolithic Anatolia, Assyria and Iran all had much in common. But only in
this relatively small area did a pattern of Near Eastern villages begin to
grow faster and harden into something else - the first true urbanism, with
many centres, and the first observable civilization, that of Sumer, the
ancient name for the southernmost part of Mesopotamia. Scholars are still
divided about when the Sumerians - that is, those who spoke the language
later called Sumerian and probably Caucasian in root - arrived in the area:
by 4000 BC they were well established. But the population of civilized
Sumer came to be a mixture of races, perhaps including even earlier
inhabitants of the region, and showing both foreign and local elements in
its culture.
Not very differently from their neighbours, the early Sumerians lived
in villages and had a few long and continuously occupied important cult
centres. One, at a place called Eridu, probably originated in about 5000 bc.
It grew steadily well into historic times and by the middle of the fourth
millennium there was a temple there which some have thought was the
original model for Mesopotamian monumental architecture, though
only the platform on which it rested now remains. Such cult centres began
as places of devotion and pilgrimage, with no considerable resident

populations. Nonetheless, cities later crystallized around them and this
helps to explain the close relationship religion and government always
had in ancient Mesopotamia.

Writing
Sumerian civilization lasted roughly from 3300 to 2000 bc. At a very early
date it produced from cylinder seals little pictures which were rolled on to
clay, and from these, Sumerians developed simplified pictures (pictograms)
made on clay tablets with a reed stalk, a big step towards true
writing. This evolved into a style called cuneiform, which used signs and
groups of signs to stand for sounds and syllables. When cuneiform was
available, much better communication of information than ever before
was possible. It made much easier the complex operations of irrigating
lands, harvesting and storing crops, and so made for more efficient
exploitation of resources. It also immensely strengthened government
and its links with the priestly castes who at first monopolized literacy.
Besides the records which now begin to survive in much greater
quantity, the invention of writing opens more of the past to us in another
way, because it preserves literature. We can at lastbegin to deal in hard currency
when talking about ideas. The oldest story in the world is the Epic of
Gilgamesh, a tale which appears in Sumerian times and written down soon
after 2000 bc. Gilgamesh was a real person, ruling at the city of Uruk, and
he became also the first individual and hero in world literature. His is the
first personal name which must appear in this book. Tb a modern reader
the most striking part of the Epic includes the coming of a great flood
which obliterated mankind except for a favoured family who survived by
building an ark; from them sprang a new race to people the world after the
flood subsided. This is not to be found in the story’s oldest versions, but in
a separate poem which turns up in many Near-Eastern forms (and in due
course in the Jewish Old Thstament) and its incorporation in the Sumerian
epic is easily understandable. Floods were the typical disaster in lower


Mesopotamia; archaeological attempts to identify a single, cataclysmic
flood behind the legend of the Ark have not been convincing, but there is
plentiful evidence of recurrent inundations.
It is hard to get at history through the Epic, let alone relate it to the historical
Gilgamesh. From the water eventually emerges the land: perhaps,
then, what we are being given is a Sumerian account of the creation of the
world, of Genesis. In the later Christian Bible, too, earth emerges from the
waters at God's will, an account which satisfied most educated Europeans
for a thousand years. We owe something of our own intellectual ancestry
to a mythical reconstruction by the Sumerians of their own pre-history,
when farming land had been created out of the morass of the
Mesopotamian delta.
Sumerian ideas were widely diffused in the Near East long after the
focus of history had moved away from Mesopotamia. Versions and parts of
the Epic - to stick to that text alone for a moment - have turned up in the
archives and relics of many peoples in different parts of this region in the
second millennium bc. Though later to be lost to sight until rediscovery in
modern times, Gilgamesh was for two thousand years or so a name to
which literature in many languages could knowingly refer. The Sumerian
language lived on for centuries in temples and scribal schools, too, much
as Latin later lived on for the learned in Europe after the collapse of the
western classical world of Rome.
Sumerian religion
Literary and linguistic tradition embody ideas and images which impose,
permit and limit different ways of seeing the world. They have their own
historic weight. The Epic of Gilgamesh tells us something of the gods of
early Mesopotamia, and probably the most important ideas kept alive by
the Sumerian language were religious. By about 2250 bc a pantheon of
individual gods more or less personifying the elements and natural forces
had emerged. It was to be the backbone of Mesopotamian religion for thousands
of years and the beginning of theology. Originally, cities had their
own gods, but they formed a loose hierarchy which both reflected and
shaped views of human society. To each of them was given a special activity
or role; there was a god of the air, another of the water, another of the
plough and a goddess of love and procreation (but also of war). At the top
of the hierarchy was a trinity of three great male gods: the father of the
gods, a ‘ Lord Air ', without whom nothing could be done, and a god of
wisdom and of the sweet waters that literally meant life to Sumer. This
reveals a view of the supernatural much more complex and elaborate than
anything elsewhere at so early a date. Significantly, temples grew bigger
and more splendid (in part, because of a tradition of building new ones on
mounds enclosing their predecessors) as the centuries passed. Sacrifices
were offered in them to ensure good crops. We hear of one built with
cedars brought from the Lebanon and copper from Anatolia. No other
ancient society at that time gave religion quite so prominent a place or

diverted so much of its collective resources to its support. Perhaps this was
because no other ancient society left men feeling so utterly dependent on
the will of the gods. Lower Mesopotamia in ancient times must have been
a flat, monotonous landscape of mudflats, marsh, and water. There were
no mountains for the gods to dwell in on earth with men, only the empty
heavens above, the remorseless summer sun, the overturning winds, the
irresistible power of flood-water, the blighting attacks of drought against
which there was very feeble protection. The gods lived in these elemental
forces, and might be approached in the high places which alone dominated
the plains, the brick-built towers and Ziggurats (faintly remembered
in the later biblical Ibwer of Babel). The Sumerians, not surprisingly, saw
themselves as a people created to serve, to labour for the gods.
The gods - though no Mesopotamian could have put it in these terms
- were the conceptualization of attempts to control environment, to resist
the sudden disasters of flood and dust-storm, to assure the continuation of
the cycle of the seasons by the repetition of the great spring festival when
the gods were again married and the drama of Creation was re-enacted.
After that, the world’s existence was assured for another year. Nothing else
was, as it were, on offer. Men later came to ask that religion should help
them to deal with the inevitable horror of death. The Sumerians and those
who inherited their religious ideas seem to have seen the next world as a
gloomy, sad place; in this lies the root of the later notion of Sheol, of Hell.
Yet a Sumerian king and queen of the middle of the third millennium were
followed to their tombs by their attendants who were then buried with
them (perhaps after taking some drug). It may be that the dead were
thought to be going somewhere where a great retinue and gorgeous jewellery
would help. As for the political aspects of Sumerian religion, all land
belonged ultimately to the gods; the king, probably a king-priest as much
as a warrior-leader in origin, was their vicar. Around him stood a priestly
class, the cultivators of special skills and knowledge. In this respect, too,
Sumer originated a tradition, that of the seers, soothsayers, wise men of
the East. They had charge of the first organized system of education, based
on memorizing and copying.
Sumerian life
Among the by-products of Sumerian religion were the first true likenesses
of human beings. Sometimes they are grouped in processions; thus is established
one of the great themes of pictorial art. Two others are also prominent:
war and the animal world. Some have also seen in Sumerian portraits
the psychological qualities which made the astonishing achievements of
their civilization possible, a drive for pre-eminence and success. What is
certainly visible in Sumerian art is a daily life hidden from us in earlier
times. Given Sumer's widespread contacts and the agriculture base it
shared with neighbouring peoples, it may tell us something of life as it was
lived over much of the ancient Near East. Seals, statuary and painting all
reveal a people often clad in a kind of furry - goat-skin or sheep-skin? -

skirt, the women sometimes throwing a fold of it over one shoulder. The
men are often, hut not always, clean-shaven. Soldiers wear the same costume
hut carry weapons and sometimes wear a pointed leather cap. Luxury
seems to have consisted in leisure and possessions, especially jewellery. Its
purpose often seems to be the indication of status; if so, that is another sign
of growing social complexity.
The head of the family was the patriarchal husband. He married after
a contract with the bride's family and presided over a household of his relatives
and slaves, a pattern common until very recently in many parts of
the world. Yet there are interesting nuances. Sumerian women seem less
down-trodden than their sisters in many other, and later, Near-Eastern
societies. Semitic and non-Semitic traditions may diverge in this. Sumerian
stories of their gods suggest a society very conscious of the power of
female sexuality; the Sumerians were the first people to write about passion.
Their law (whose influence can be traced well past 2000 bc) into post 
Sumerian times certainly gave women important rights. A woman was not
a mere chattel; even the slave mother of a free man's children had rights.
Women as well as men could seek separations and could hope for equitable
treatment after divorce. Though a wife's adultery was punishable by
death while a husband's was not, this can be understood in the light of concern
over inheritance and property. Only much later did Mesopotamian
law begin to emphasize the importance of virginity and to impose the veil
on respectable women. Both were signs of a hardening and more cramping role for them.
By the end of their history as an independent civilization the Sumerians
had learnt to live in large communities; one city alone is said to have
had thirty-six thousand males. This made big demands on building skill,
but even more were made by great monumental structures. Lacking stone,
southern Mesopotamians first built in reeds plastered with mud, then with
mud bricks dried in the sun. By the end of the Sumerian period brick technology
was advanced enough to build very large buildings with columns
and terraces; the greatest, the Ziggurat of Ur, had an upper stage over a hundred
feet high and a base two hundred feet by a hundred and fifty. The earliest
surviving potter's wheel (found at Ur) makes another technological
step; this was the first known exploitation of rotary motion. On it rested the
large- scale production of pottery which made it a man's trade and not, like
earlier pottery, a woman's. Soon, by 3000 bc, the wheel was applied to
transport. Another invention of the Sumerians was glass, and specialized
craftsmen were casting in bronze early in the third millennium bc.
This raises further questions: where did the raw material come from?
There is no metal in southern Mesopotamia. Even in Neolithic times, too,
the region must have imported flint and obsidian for agricultural implements.
A widespread network of external contacts evidently existed, both
with the Persian Gulf peoples and with the distant Levant and Syria. Certainly
by 2000 BC Mesopotamia was obtaining goods - though possibly indirectly
- from the Indus valley. With some fragmentary documentation.

this suggests a dimly emerging interregional trading system which was
already creating patterns of economic interdependence.
Yet the basis of society remained agriculture for local provision.
Barley, wheat, millet and sesame were grown in quantity; the first may
have been the main crop, and no doubt explains the frequent evidence
of the presence of alcohol in ancient Mesopotamia. In the easy soil of
the flood bed iron tools were not needed to achieve intensive cultivation;
the great contribution of technology here was in the practice of irrigation,
building and the growth of government. Such skills accumulated slowly;
the evidence of Sumerian civilization is spread over fifteen hundred
years of history, so far discussed almost as if nothing happened during it,
as if it were an unchanging whole. Of course it was not. Whatever reservations
are made about the slowness of change in the ancient world
and though it may now seem to us very static, we know these were
fifteen centuries of great change for the Mesopotamians even if much of
it remains obscure, and even its dating is for much of the time only
approximate.

Political change
Three broad phases can be marked out. The first phase of Sumer, lasting
from about 3360 bc to 2400 bc, is its archaic period. The narrative story is
one of wars between city-states, their waxings and wanings. Fortified cities
and the application of the wheel to military technology in clumsy four 
wheeled chariots are some of the evidence for it. Ibwards the middle of
this phase, local dynasties begin to establish themselves with some success.
Originally, Sumerian society seems to have had some representative,
even democratic basis, but a growth of scale led to the distinction of kings
from the early priestly rulers; they may have emerged as warlords
appointed by cities to command their forces who clung to power when the
emergency which called them forth had passed. From them stemmed the
dynasties which fought one another.
The sudden appearance of a great individual then opens a new phase.
He was Sargon I, a king of a city higher up the Euphrates called Akkad
whose site is undiscovered. He conquered the Sumerian cities between
2400 and 2350 bc and inaugurated an Akkadian supremacy over them. His
people came from among those Semitic tribes which had long pressed in
on the civilizations of the river valleys from outside. There exists a
sculpted head which is believed to be his portrait; if it is, it is one of the first
royal images. He was the first of a long line of empire-builders and is
alleged to have sent his troops as far afield as Egypt and Ethiopia. Sargon's
rule was not based on the relative superiority of one city state to another;
he set up a unified empire integrating the cities into a whole. They left
behind a new style of Sumerian art marked by the theme of royal victory.
Akkadian empire was not the end of Sumer, though, but an interlude and
its second main phase. It expressed a new achievement in organization.
By Sargon’s time a true state has appeared. Lay and priestly authority

had completely diverged. Palaces appeared beside the temples in the
Sumerian cities; the authority of the gods lay behind the palaces’
occupants, too.
The invention of professional soldiery probably played a part in this.
Disciplined infantry, moving in formation with overlapping shields and
levelled spears, appear on monuments from Ur. Sargon, it was boasted,
had 5,400 soldiers eating before him in his palace. This, no doubt, was the
outcome of conquests which had provided the resources to maintain such
a force. If state power had originated in the special challenges and needs
of Mesopotamia, and the primary duty of the ruler to organize big works of
irrigation and flood control, the power to assemble labour for this could
also provide soldiers. As weapons became more complex and expensive,
professionalism would be more likely. One source of Akkadian success
was the use of a new weapon, the composite bow made of strips of wood
and horn.
A century and a half after Sargon, under his great-grandson, the Akkadian
hegemony was overthrown, apparently by mountain peoples called
Gutians, and the third, last, phase of Sumer, called by scholars ' neo Sumerian ', 
began. For another two hundred years or so, until 2000 bc,
hegemony again passed to the native Sumerians whose centre was Ur.
The first king of the Third Dynasty of Ur who exercised this ascendancy
called himself King of Sumer and Akkad, whatever that might mean in
practice. Sumerian art in this phase showed a new tendency to exalt the
power of the prince; rulers sought to embody their grandeur in bigger and
better ziggurats. Administrative documents show the Akkadian legacy,
too. Perhaps the aspiration to wider kingship reflects this inheritance. The
tributaries of the last successful kings of Ur stretched from Susa, on the
frontiers of a land called Elam on the lower Tigris, to Byblos on the coast
of Lebanon.
This was the sunset era of the first civilization. It did not disappear, but
its individuality was about to be lost in the general history of Mesopotamia
and the Near East. A great creative era was over. From one relatively small
area, the horizons of our history now need to expand. Enemies abounded
on Sumer’s frontiers. In about 2000 bc, the Elamites came and Ur fell to
them. Why, we do not know, but after intermittent hostility for a thousand
years this has been seen as the outcome of a struggle to control routes
giving access to the highlands of Iran and the minerals the Mesopotamians
needed. At all events, it was the end of Ur and the distinctive Sumerian
tradition, now merged in the swirling currents of a world of more than one
civilization. Yet for fifteen centuries or so Sumer had built up the subsoil
of civilization in Mesopotamia, just as its precivilized forerunners had built
up the physical land itself. The Sumerians left behind writing, a literature,
a m5rthology, monumental buildings, an idea of justice and legalism, and
the roots of a great religious tradition. It is a wonderful record and the seed
of much else; the diffusion of civilized ways had already gone far when
Sumer died.

MESOPOTAMIA AFTER SUMER
The Near East was by then a growing confusion of peoples. The Akkadians
had pushed up originally from the great Semitic reservoir of Arabia
to finish in Mesopotamia. The Gutians, who took part in the Akkadians’
overthrow, were Caucasians, from among the original stocks of the area.
The Amorites, a Semitic people which had spread far and wide and
joined the Elamites to overthrow the armies of Ur and destroy its
supremacy, had established themselves in Damascus, Assyria, or upper
Mesopotamia, and Babylon in a series of kingdoms which stretched as far
as the coast of Palestine. Southern Mesopotamia they continued to dispute
with the Elamites. In Anatolia their neighbours were Hittites, an
Indo-European people which crossed from the Balkans in the third
millennium. At the edges of this chaotic picture stood other vigorous
peoples.
Babylon
One landmark is a new empire in Mesopotamia: Babylon. One of its kings,
Hammurabi, would have a secure place in history if we knew nothing of
him except his reputation as a law-giver; his code is the oldest statement of
the legal principle of an eye for an eye. He was also the first ruler to unify
the whole of Mesopotamia; though the empire was short-lived, the city of
Babylon was to be from his time the symbolic centre of the Semitic peoples
of the south. Hammurabi may have become its ruler in 1792 bc; his successors
held things together until some time after 1600 bc, when
Mesopotamia was once more divided.
At its height the first Babylonian empire ran from Sumer and the Gulf
north to Assyria, the upper part of Mesopotamia. Hammurabi ruled the
cities of Nineveh and Nimrud on the Tigris, Mari high on the Euphrates,
and controlled that river up to the point at which it is nearest to Aleppo.
Seven hundred or so miles long and about a hundred miles wide, this was
a great state, the greatest, indeed, to appear in the region up to this time
(Ur had been a looser, tributary affair). It had an elaborate administrative
structure, and Hammurabi’s code of laws is justly famous, though this
owes something to chance. As probably happened to earlier collections of
judgements and rules which have only survived in fragments, Hammurabi’s
was cut in stone and set up in the courtyard of temples for the
public to consult; it happened to survive. At greater length and in a more
ordered way than earlier collections it assembled some 282 articles, dealing
comprehensively with a wide range of questions: wages, divorce, fees
for medical attention and many other matters. It was not legislation, but a
declaration of existing law, and to speak of a ‘code’ may be misleading
unless this is remembered. Hammurabi assembled rules already current;
he did not create them de novo.
This body of'common law’ long provided one of the major continuities
of Mesopotamian history. Sadly, perhaps, as time went by its penalties

seem to have harshened by comparison with Sumer, but in other respects
Sumerian tradition survived in Babylon in law.
The code’s provisions included laws about slaves. Like every other
ancient civilization and many of later times, Babylon rested on slavery.
Slavery was the fate likely to await the loser of any ancient war of early history,
and his women and children, too. Under the first Babylonian empire,
regular slave-markets already existed and steady prices indicated a fairly
regular trade, in which slaves from certain districts were especially prized.
Though the master's hold on the slave was virtually absolute, some Babylonian
slaves enjoyed remarkable economic independence, engaging in
business and even owning slaves on their own account. They had legal
rights, if narrow ones. It is hard to say what this meant in practice. Generalities
dissolve in the light of evidence about the diversity of things slaves
might do; if most lived hard lives, then so, probably, did most people. In
ancient times civilization rested on a great exploitation of man by man; if
that was not felt to be very cruel, this is only to say that no one thought any
other way of running things was conceivable.
Babylonian thought
Babylonian civilization remains a legend of magnificence. The great
palace of Mari, high up the Euphrates, had walls in places forty feet thick
around its courtyards, and three hundred or so rooms forming a complex
drained by bitumen-lined pipes running thirty feet deep. It covered an
area measuring 150 by over 200 yards and in it were found great quantities
of clay tablets revealing the business of Babylonian government. They
give us evidence of the life of the mind, too. The Epic of Gilgamesh then
took the shape in which we know it.
The Babylonians' astrology pushed forward the observation of nature.
Hoping to understand their destinies by scanning the stars, they founded
a science, astronomy, and established an important series of observations.
By 1000 BC the prediction of lunar eclipses was possible. Within another
two or three centuries the path of the sun and some of the planets had
been plotted with remarkable accuracy against the positions of the apparently
fixed stars. Babylonian mathematics drew upon the intellectual
achievements of the Sumerians, to whom we owe the technique of
expressing number by position as well as by sign (as we, for example, can
reckon the figure 1 as one, one-tenth, ten or several other values, according
to its relation to the decimal point). The Sumerians had known about
the decimal system, too, but did not exploit it, and arrived at a method of
dividing the circle into six equal segments. From this the Babylonians progressed
to the circle of 360 degrees and the hour of sixty minutes. They
also worked out mathematical tables and an algebraic geometry of great
practical utility.
Astronomy had begun in the temple, in the contemplation of celestial
movements announcing the advent of festivals of fertility and sowing, and
Babylonian religion, too, held close to Sumerian tradition. Its cosmogony


began, like that of Sumer, with the creation of the world from watery waste
(the name of one god meant ‘silt’) and the eventual fabrication of Man as
the slave of the gods. In one version, gods turned men out like bricks, from
clay moulds. It was a cosmic picture which suited absolute monarchy. Like
the old cities, Babylon also had a civic god, Marduk; gradually he elbowed
his way to the front among his Mesopotamian rivals. This took a long time,
but Hammurabi said that the Sumerian gods had conferred the headship
of the Mesopotamian pantheon upon Marduk, bidding him to rule over all
men for their good. After the twelfth century bc Marduk's status was usually
unquestioned. Meanwhile, Sumerian continued to be used in the
Babylonian liturgies, in the names of the gods and the attributions they
enjoyed.
Hammurabi’s achievement did not long survive him. He had over¬
thrown an Amorite kingdom established in Assyria at the end of the hegemony
of Ur, but this was a temporary success. For the next thousand
years Assyria was to be a battleground and prize; then it came to overshadow
Babylon and the centre of gravity of Mesopotamian history
moved decisively northwards. The Hittites who had established themselves
in Anatolia in the last quarter of the third millennium bc pushed
slowly forwards in the next few centuries; they, too, took cuneiform and
adapted it to their own Indo-European language. By 1700 bc they ruled
the lands between Syria and the Black Sea. Then, they turned southwards
against a weakened and shrunken Babylonia. Hammurabi's dynasty and
achievement finally came to an end. When the Hittites withdrew other
peoples ruled and disputed Mesopotamia for a mysterious four centuries
of which we know little except that during them the separation of Assyria
and Babylonia which was to be so important in the next millennium was
made final. By then, though, the focus of world history had shifted away
from Mesopotamia.

ANCIENT EGYPT
Soon after they appear in Sumer, the first signs of civilization can be seen
in Egypt. If the Egyptians learnt from Sumer (and it seems likely), we do
not know how, what, or to what extent. Much more of the explanation is
supplied, as in southern Mesopotamia, by the setting. Prehistoric climatic
change had gradually dried up most of Egypt outside the valley of the Nile
itself. Yet that narrow strip of fertile land was enough. The mud washed
down from the interior highlands and deposited there made agriculture
easy. On the banks of silt 1,100 kilometres long and anything from six to
twenty wide, the first Egyptians were able to start farming. Their land
slowly turned into a long straggling oasis, surrounded by desert and rock.
It was importantly different from ancient Mesopotamia as a setting for a
new stage of human development. The Egyptians needed no such reclamation
works as the Sumerians. The Nile was friendlier than the Tigris and
Euphrates. Like them it flooded each year, but it did so predictably; its

floods were not sudden, surprising disasters but so regular that they set the
pattern of the agricultural year. The Nile was a huge clock, regulating the
life of the ancient Egyptians in a rhythm unvaried from year to year.
In about 3300 bc, substantial numbers of people already lived along
some five to six hundred kilometres of the lower Nile in villages and hamlets
not much separated from one another. These Egyptians at first seem
to have thought of themselves as members of clans rather than settled
communities. Cities did not develop along the river until thousands of
years had passed, perhaps because there were no powerful neighbours to
threaten the farmers and encourage them to live in towns for protection.
But about these early days it is difficult to know much because the Nile
destroyed the evidence each year, either washing it away to the delta, or
burying it deep in the banks of soil which slowly rose above high-water
mark as the centuries passed. We know that these early Egyptians knew
how to make papyrus boats, to work hard stone, and to hammer copper
into articles for daily use. Somewhere about the middle of the fourth millennium,
too, there are signs of contact with other areas - notably
Mesopotamia. There is a sudden sense of rapid crystallization.
Information rapidly becomes much more abundant about early civilized Egypt
than about anywhere else at so early a date. Egyptians had
from almost the start a form of writing, called ' hieroglyphic '. It was in
origin pictographic, that is, consisting of little pictures which stood for the
names of things; with time they came to stand for sounds. Because it was
always harder to write, hieroglyph never spread as did cuneiform, though
it had just as long a life; the last known example was not written until
AD 394. Thereafter, as mastery of writing it was lost, so it became unintelligible.
Then, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Rosetta
Stone ' was brought back to France from Egypt. It was inscribed in Greek
and the later ' demotic ' Egyptian as well as in hieroglyph, and this made
translation possible. It opened the way to understanding ancient Egypt as
never before, because of the large number of inscriptions on tombs, monuments
and papyrus which survived.

From these hieroglyphics there emerges a narrative. Egypt was by
3000 Bc already organized in two kingdoms, northern and southern, Lower
and Upper, Egypt. Soon, the records say, a king from the south called
Menes conquered the north and established a dynasty which lasted until
2884 BC, ruling from Memphis in Lower Egypt. This was a realm approximately
1,000 kilometres long - a much bigger affair than any other contemporary
state. What its government meant is hard to say, but it is an
impressive achievement to have established even a claim to rule so big an
area. More striking still, this began some 2,000 years during which Egypt
was usually under one ruler, one religious system, and one pattern of government
and society, while no important influence intruded from the outside.
There were ups and downs; the state was sometimes strong and
prosperous, sometimes weak and poor. Nonetheless, this is a still astonishing
continuity and it made possible great achievements whose physical
remains would long fascinate mankind as its greatest visible inheritance
from antiquity.
The historical records enable scholars to talk about ancient Egypt as a
series of dynasties in three major divisions of time. The first, termed the
‘Old Kingdom' runs from 2664 to 2155 bc. There follows a century or so of
upheaval before the ‘Middle Kingdom’ then begins in 2051. It lasted until
1786 BC when another disturbed period opened, to end in 1554 bc with the
beginning of the ‘New Kingdom'. Into this tripartite scheme are then fitted
two ‘intermediate’ periods, and the dates of the dynasties. It can be conveniently
closed off at the beginning of the first millennium bc, when the
Egyptians’ greatest achievements were behind them, although there was
to be an independent Egypt under its own rulers until 30 bc, when it came
to an end with the suicide of the legendary Cleopatra.

Egyptian kingship
The state itself was the embodiment of Egyptian civilization. It was centred
first at Memphis, the capital of the Old Kingdom. Later, under the
New Kingdom, the capital was normally at Thebes. These two places were
great religious centres and palace complexes; they were not really cities
with lives apart from government. Partly this was because Egypt’s kings
had not emerged as ‘big men’ in a city-state community which originally
deputed them to act for it. Nor were they simply men like others, subject
to gods who ruled all men, great or small. They were themselves to be
gods. At an early stage Egyptian monarchs already had an impressive
authority, as their huge images on early monuments show; they inherited
it ultimately from prehistoric kings who had a special sanctity because of
their power to assure prosperity through successful agriculture. They
were believed to control the annual rise and fall of the Nile: life itself, no
less, to the riparian communities. The first rituals of Egyptian kingship
which are known to us are concerned with fertility, irrigation and land
reclamation. The earliest representations of Menes show him excavating a
canal.

Under the Old Kingdom the idea appears that the king, or ' Pharaoh ',
was the absolute lord, and soon he was venerated as a god. Justice is ' what
Pharaoh loves ', evil ' what Pharaoh hates'; he is divinely omniscient and so
needs no code of law to guide him. Later, under the New Kingdom, the
Pharaohs were to be depicted with the heroic stature of great warriors;
they are shown in their chariots, mighty men of war, trampling down
their enemies and confidently slaughtering beasts of prey, but Egyptian
kingship remained sacred and awesome. ' He is a god by whose dealings
one lives, the father and mother of all men, alone by himself, without an
equal ', wrote an Egyptian civil servant of the Pharaoh as late as about
1500 Bc.
By then Egypt had an elaborate and impressive hierarchy of bureaucrats.
Usually, the most important came from the nobility; a few of the
greatest were buried with a pomp rivalling that of the Pharaohs. Less eminent
families provided thousands of scribes to staff and service an elaborate
machine of government. They were trained in a special school at
Thebes and their ethos can be sensed through texts which list the virtues
needed to succeed as a scribe: application to study, self-control, prudence,
respect for superiors, scrupulous regard for the sanctity of weights, measures,
landed property and legal forms.
Most Egyptians, though, were peasants, providing labour for great
public works and the surplus upon which a noble class, the bureaucracy
and a great religious establishment could subsist. The land was rich
enough, and was increasingly improved by irrigation techniques which
were some of the earliest manifestations of the remarkable capacity to
mobilize collective effort which Egyptian government long showed. Vegetables,
barley, emmer were the main crops of the fields laid out along the
irrigation channels; the diet they afforded was supplemented by poultry,
fish and game (all of which figure plentifully in Egyptian art). Cattle were
used for traction and ploughing at least as early as the Old Kingdom. With
little change this agriculture sustained Egypt until modern times.
Egyptian building
It also made possible public works in stone unsurpassed in their time.
Houses and farm buildings were made of mud brick. They were not meant
to outface eternity. The palaces, tombs and memorials of the Pharaohs
were a different matter, social and administrative as well as architectural
triumphs. Under the direction of a scribe, thousands of slaves and sometimes
regiments of soldiers would be deployed to cut and man-handle into
position huge pieces of stone carefully dressed with first copper and then
bronze tools and often elaborately incised and painted. With only such
assistance as was available from levers and sleds - no winches, pulleys,
blocks or tackle existed - and by the use of colossal ramps of earth, a succession
of still-startling buildings was produced. The most famous are the
pyramids, which dominate the great complexes of buildings housing the
king after death. Among those of the Third Dynasty, at Saqqara, near


Memphis, one, the ' Step Pyramid ', was the masterpiece of the first identified
architect, Imhotep, chancellor to the king. He was later to be deified -
as the god of medicine - as well as revered as astronomer, priest and sage.
The beginning of building in stone was attributed to him and it is easy to
believe that something so unprecedented as the two-hundred-foot-high
pyramid was seen as evidence of godlike power. During the Fourth
Dynasty, though, still greater pyramids were completed at Giza. Cheops'
pyramid was twenty years in the building and huge quantities of stone
(between five and six million tons) were brought to it from as much as 500
miles away. This colossal construction is perfectly orientated and its sides,
750 feet long, vary by less than ten inches. Unsurprisingly, the Pyramids
later figured among the Seven Wonders of the World. Nor, of course, were
they the only great monuments of Egypt. At other sites there were great
temples, palaces, and the tombs of the Valley of the Kings.
These huge public works explain why the Egyptians were later
thought to have been great scientists: people could not believe that such
building did not require the most refined mathematical and scientific
knowledge. Yet though Egyptian surveying was highly skilled and Egyptian
civil servants were accomplished civil engineers, only elementary
mathematics was needed to build as they did. Competence in mensuration
and the manipulation of certain formulae for calculating volumes and
weights was sufficient, and this was as far as Egyptian mathematics went.
The Egyptians did not rival Babylon in the sciences. The inscriptions in
which Egyptian astronomical observations were recorded commanded
centuries of respect from astrologers, but their scientific value was low
and their predictive quality relatively short-term. Their one solid achievement
was the calendar. The Egyptians established the solar year of 365
days, which they divided into twelve months, each of thfee ‘weeks' of ten
days, with five extra days at the end of the year (an arrangement, it may
be remarked, revived in 1793 when the French revolutionaries sought to
replace the Christian calendar by one more rational).
Religion
The religious life of ancient Egypt also greatly struck foreigners. Yet it
remains something with which it is difficult to come to grips, an all-pervasive
framework, as much taken for granted as the circulatory system of the
human body, rather than an independent structure such as what later
came to be understood as a church. It was not consciously seen as a growing,
lively force: it was, rather, one aspect of reality, a description of an
unchanging cosmos. But this, too, may be a misleading way of putting it;
we have to remember that concepts and distinctions which we take for
granted did not exist for the ancient Egyptians. The boundary between
religion and magic, for example, hardly mattered for them.
Whatever religion in ancient Egypt meant, for almost the whole duration
of their civilization, the ancient Egyptians show a remarkably consistent
tendency to seek through it a way of penetrating the variety of the


flow of ordinary experience so as to reach a changeless world most easily
understood through the life the dead lived there. Perhaps the pulse of the
Nile is to be detected here, too; each year it swept away and made new, but
its cycle was ever recurring, changeless, the embodiment of a cosmic
rhythm. The supreme change threatening men was death, the worst
expression of the decay and flux which was their common experience.
Egyptian religion seems from the start obsessed with it: its most familiar
embodiments, after all, are the mummy and the grave-goods from funeral
chambers preserved in our museums. Under the Middle Kingdom it came
to be believed that all men, not just the king, could expect life in another
world. Accordingly, through ritual and symbol, through preparation of the
case he would have to put to his judges in the afterworld, a man might prepare
for the afterlife with a reasonable confidence that he could achieve
the changeless well-being offered by it in principle. The Egyptian view of
the afterlife was, therefore, unlike the gloomy version of the Mesopotamians;
men could be happy in it. The centuries-long struggle to assure that
they would explains the obsessively elaborate care shown in preparing
tombs and conducting the deceased to his eternal resting-place.
The Egyptian pantheon was huge. There were about two thousand
gods and several important cults, some originating in prehistoric animal
deities. One, Horus, the falcon god, was also god of the dynasty. These animals
underwent a slow but incomplete humanization; artists stick their
animal heads on to human bodies. Their relationships were rearranged in
fresh patterns as the Pharaohs sought through the consolidation of their
cults to achieve political ends. In this way the cult of Horus was consolidated
with that of the sun-god, of whom the Pharaoh came to be regarded
as the incarnation. It was not the end of the story. Horus later underwent
another transformation, to appear as the offspring of Osiris, the central
figure of a national cult, and his consort Isis. This goddess of creation and
love was probably the most ancient of all - her origins, too, go back to the
pre-dynastic era, she is one development of a ubiquitous mother-goddess
of whom evidence survives from all over the Neolithic Near East. She was
long to endure, her image, the infant Horus in her arms, surviving into the
Christian iconography of the Virgin Mary. Among the most celebrated
variations of a doctrinal and speculative kind, must be reckoned the
attempt of a fourteenth-century pharaoh to establish the cult of Aton,
another manifestation of the sun. It has been seen as the first monotheistic religion.

Egyptian art and technology
The gods loom large in ancient Egyptian art, but it contains much more
besides. It was based on a fundamental naturalism which, however
restrained by conventions of expression and gesture, gave it for two millennia
at first a beautiful simplicity and later, in a more decadent style,
an endearing charm and approachability. It permitted a realistic portrayal
of scenes of everyday life. Rural themes of farming, fishing and hunting


are deployed; craftsmen are shown at work on their products, and
scribes at their duties. For some two thousand years, artists were able to
work satisfyingly within the same classical tradition while borrowing
from foreign influences, with a central strength and solidity which never
wavers. It must have been one of the most impressive visual features of
Egypt to a visitor in ancient times; what he saw was all of a piece, the
longest and strongest continuous tradition in the whole history of civilized art.
Some ancient Egyptian art has survived thanks to the invention (as
early as the First Dynasty) of papsrrus - strips of reed-pith, laid criss-cross
and pounded together into a homogeneous sheet. This was a real contribution
to the progress of mankind. It did more for communication than
hieroglyph. Papyrus was cheaper than skin (from which parchment was
made) and more convenient (though more perishable) than clay tablets
or slates of stone. It was therefore to be the most general basis of correspondence
and record in the Near East until well into the Christian era,
when the invention of paper arrived from the Far East (and took its name
from papyrus). Soon after the appearance of papyrus, writers began to
paste sheets of it together into a long roll; thus the Egyptians invented the
book, as well as the matefial on which it could first be written. A huge proportion
of what we know of antiquity comes to us on papyrus.
The supposed prowess of her religious and magical practitioners and
the spectacular embodiment of a political achievement in art and architecture
explains much of Egypt's continuing prestige. Yet if her civilization
is looked at comparatively, it seems neither very fertile nor very responsive.
Stone architecture is the only major innovation for a long time after
the coming of literacy; the Egyptians invented the column. Thechnological
history suggests a people slow to adopt new skills, reluctant to innovate
once the creative jump to civilization had been made. There is no definite
evidence of the presence of the potter’s wheel before the Old Kingdom; for
all the skill of goldsmiths and coppersmiths, bronze-making does not
appear until well into the second millennium bc and the lathe only much
later still. The bow-drill was almost the only tool for the multiplication and
transmission of energy available to Egyptian craftsmen. Though papyrus
and the wheel were known under the First Dynasty, Egypt had been in
touch with Mesopotamia for getting on for two thousand years before she
adopted the well-sweep, by then long in use to irrigate land in the other
river valley.
Life for the Egyptian poor was hard, but not unremittingly so. The
major burden must have been conscript labour services. When these were
not exacted by Pharaoh, then the peasant would have considerable leisure
at those times when he waited for the flooding Nile to do its work for him.
The agricultural base was rich enough, too, to sustain a complex and variegated
society with a wide range of craftsmen. About their activities we
know more than of those of their Mesopotamian equivalents, thanks to
stone-carvings and paintings. The great division of this society was


between the educated, who could enter the state service, and the rest.
Slavery was important, but, it appears, less fundamental an institution
than elsewhere in the ancient Near East.

Women in ancient Egypt
Tradition in later times remarked upon the seductiveness and accessibility
of Egyptian women. It helps to give an impression of a society which gave
them somewhat more independence and higher status than their sisters in
other civilizations. Some weight must be given to an art which depicts
court ladies clad in fine and revealing cottons, exquisitely coiffured and
jewelled, wearing the carefully applied cosmetics to whose provision
Egyptian merchants gave much attention. We should not lean too strongly
on this, but even the pictorial impression of the way in which women of
the Egyptian ruling class were treated is important, and it is one of dignity
and independence. The Pharaohs and their consorts - and other noble
couples - are sometimes depicted, too, with an intimacy of mood found
nowhere else in the art of the ancient Near East before the first millennium Bc.
Their suggestion of a real emotional equality can hardly be
accidental.
The beautiful and charming women who appear in many of the paintings
and sculptures may reflect a certain political potential for their sex
which was lacking elsewhere. The throne often in practice descended
through the female line. An heiress brought to her husband the right of
succession; hence there was much anxiety about the marriage of
princesses. Many royal marriages were of brother and sister, apparently
without unsatisfactory genetic effects; some Pharaohs married their
daughters, but perhaps to prevent anyone else marrying them rather than
to ensure the continuity of the divine blood. Some female consorts exercised
important power and one even occupied the throne, being willing to
appear ritually bearded, in a man’s clothes, and taking the title of

Pharaoh.
There is also much femininity about the Egyptian pantheon, notably
in the cult of Isis, which is suggestive. Literature and art stress a respect for
the wife and mother which goes beyond the confines of the circle of the
notabilities. Both love stories and scenes of family life emphasize a tender
eroticism, relaxation and informality. Some women were literate and
there is even an Egyptian word for a female scribe, but there were, of
course, not many occupations open to women outside the home except
those of priestess or prostitute. If they were well-off, however, they could
own property and their legal rights seem in most respects to have been
akin to those of Sumerian women.

The Old and Middle Kingdoms
For all the records, it is difficult to keep in perspective Egypt’s relations
with the world outside or the ebb and flow of authority within the Nile
valley. There are huge tracts of time to account for when it is difficult to

be sure exactly what was going on and what was its importance. For
nearly a thousand years after Menes, Egypt's history can be considered in
virtual isolation. It was to be looked back upon as a time of stability when
Pharaohs were impregnable. Yet under the Old Kingdom there has been
detected a decentralization of authority; provincial officers show increasing
importance and independence. The Pharaoh, too, still had to wear two
crowns and was twice buried, once in Upper and once in Lower Egypt;
that division was still real. Relations with neighbours were not remarkable,
though a series of expeditions was mounted against the peoples of
Palestine towards the end of the Old Kingdom. The First Intermediate
period which followed saw the position reversed and Egypt was the
invaded, rather than the invader. No doubt weakness and division helped
Asian invaders to establish themselves for a time in the valley of the lower
Nile.
The Middle Kingdom was effectively inaugurated by a powerful king
who reunified the kingdom from his capital at Thebes. For about a quarter
millennium after 2000 bc, Egypt enjoyed a period of recovery and there
was a new emphasis on order and social cohesion. The divine status of the
Pharaoh subtly changes: not only is he God, but it is emphasized that he is
descended from gods and will be followed by gods. The eternal order will
continue unshaken after bad times have made men doubt. It is certain,
too, that there was expansion and material growth. Great reclamation
work was achieved in the marshes of the Nile. Nubia, to the south,
between the first and third cataracts, was conquered and its goldmines
exploited. Egyptian settlements were founded even farther south, too, in
what was later to be a mysterious kingdom called Kush. Made leaves more
elaborate traces than ever before and the copper mines of the Sinai were
now worked again. Yet the Middle Kingdom ended in political upheaval
and dynastic competition.
The Second Intermediate period of roughly two hundred years was
marked by another and far more dangerous incursion of foreigners
remembered as the Hyksos. Not much is known about them, but they
were possibly a Semitic people, who used the military advantage of iron fitted
chariots to win overlordship in the Nile delta. Seemingly, they took
over Egyptian conventions and methods, even maintaining the existing
bureaucrats at first, but this did not lead to assimilation and under the
Eighteenth Dynasty they were evicted; this was the start of the New Kingdom,
which followed up victory in the years after 1570 bc by pursuing the
Hyksos into their strongholds in south Canaan and in the end occupying
much of Syria and Palestine.
The New Kingdom
The New Kingdom in its prime was internationally very successful and
left rich physical memorials. There was under the Eighteenth Dynasty
almost a renaissance of the arts, a transformation of military techniques
by the adoption of Asiatic devices such as the chariot, and, above all, a



huge consolidation of royal authority. Interestingly, too, this was when the
throne was for a time occupied by a woman, Hatshepsut. For a century or
so Egypt won further military glory, Hatshepsut’s consort and successor,
Thotmes III, carrying the limits of the empire to the Euphrates. Monuments
recording the arrival of tribute and slaves or marriages with Asiatic
princesses testify to Egyptian pre-eminence; at home the period is generally
regarded as the peak of Egyptian artistic achievement, though foreign
influences (from Crete) can be discovered.
Towards the end of the New Kingdom, signs of multiplied foreign contacts
begin to show also that the world outside Egypt had already changed
in many ways. Even Thotmes III had taken seventeen years to subdue the
Levant and he had to leave unconquered a huge empire ruled by people
called the Mitanni who dominated eastern Syria and northern
Mesopotamia. Later, a Mitanni princess married a pharaoh and the New
Kingdom came to rely on the friendship of her people to protect Egyptian
interests in this area. Egypt was being forced out of the isolation which had
long protected her. But the Mitanni were under growing pressure to the
north from the Hittites, one of the most important of the peoples whose
ambitions and movements break up the world of the Near East more and
more in the second half of the second millennium bc. Things went on
changing.

Egypt reached its peak of prestige and prosperity under Amenhotep
III (c.1410-375 Bc). It was the greatest era of Thebes and he was fittingly
buried there in the largest tomb ever prepared for a king, though nothing
of it now remains but the fragments of the huge statues the Greeks later
called the colossi of Memnon (a legendary hero, whom they supposed to
be Ethiopian). His successor, Amenhotep IV, attempted a religious revolution,
the substitution of a monotheistic cult of the sun-god Aton for the
ancient religion. Td mark his seriousness, he changed his name to Akhna-
ton and founded a new city at Amarna, 300 miles north of Thebes, where
a temple with a roofless sanctuary open to the sun’s rays was the centre of
the new creed. The opposition his religious revolution provoked helped to
cripple him on other fronts. Meanwhile, Hittite pressure was telling on the
Egyptian dependencies; Akhnaton could not save the Mitanni. They lost
all their lands west of the Euphrates to the Hittites in 1372. A civil war then
preceded their kingdom’s disappearance thirty years or so later. The
Egyptian imperial sphere was crcreedumbling.

The era of decline
Amenhotep IV had changed his name because he wished to erase the reminiscence
of the cult of the old god Amon; his successor and son-in-law
changed his name from Tfitankhaton to register its restoration and the
overthrow of the attempted religious reform. It may have been gratitude
for this that led to the magnificent burial in the Valley of the Kings which
was given to Thtankhamon after only a short and otherwise unremarkable
reign. When he died, the New Kingdom had two centuries of life ahead.


but they were centuries of only occasionally interrupted and steadily
accelerating decline. Later kings made efforts to recover lost ground and
sometimes succeeded; the waves of conquest rolled back and forth over
Palestine and at one time a pharaoh took a Hittite princess as a bride as his
predecessors had taken princesses from other peoples. But there were yet
more new enemies appearing; even a Hittite alliance was no longer a safeguard.
The Aegean was in uproar, the islands ' poured out their people all
together’ and ‘no land stood before them', say the Egyptian records. These
'sea peoples' were eventually beaten off, but the struggle was hard. From
about 1150 Bc the signs of internal disorganization, too, are plentiful. One
king, Ramses III, died as a result of a conspiracy in the harem; he was the
last to achieve some measure of success in offsetting the swelling tide of
disaster. We hear of strikes and economic troubles under his successors
and sacrilegious looting of the royal tombs at Thebes. The age of Egypt's
imperial power was in fact over.
So was that of the Hittites, and of other empires of the end of the
second millennium. The world which was the setting of Egypt's glories
was itself passing away. Much of the explanation of Egypt's decline must
be sought in that. Yet it is impossible to resist the feeling that the end of the
New Kingdom exposes weaknesses present from the beginning. The creativity
of Egyptian civilization seemed, in the end, strangely to miscarry.
Colossal resources of labour were massed under the direction of outstanding
civil servants, but only to set up the greatest tombstones the world has
ever seen. Craftsmanship of exquisite quality was employed, but to make
grave-goods. A highly literate elite utilizing a complex and subtle language
and possessing, in papyrus, a material of unsurpassed convenience,
deployed them copiously in texts and inscriptions, but left to humanity no
great philosophical or religious idea. It is difficult not to sense an ultimate
sterility, a nothingness, at the heart of this glittering tour de force. Only its
sheer staying-power remains amazing. It worked for a very long time,
undergoing at least two phases of considerable eclipse, but recovering
from them, seemingly unchanged. Survival on such a scale is a great material
and historical success; what remains obscure is why it should have
stopped at survival. In the end, even Egypt’s military and economic power
made little permanent difference to the world and her civilization was
never successfully spread abroad.
Of course, in early times all social and cultural change was slow and
often imperceptible. Used as we are to change, it is difficult for us to sense
the huge inertia possessed by any successful social system (one, that is,
which enables men to grapple effectively with their physical and mental
environment) in the ancient world. Innovation had far fewer and far more
occasional sources then than now. The pace of history is rapid in ancient
Egypt if we think of prehistory; it seems glacially slow if we reflect how little
daily life must have changed between Menes and Thotmes III, a period of
more than fifteen hundred years (and comparable to that which separates
us from the end of Roman Britain). Only very slowly could technology or


economic forces exert such pressures for change as we take for granted. As
for intellectual stimuli, these could hardly be strong in a society dedicated
to the inculcation of routine and preparation for death.

ASIA'S FIRST CIVILIZATIONS
By 1000 Bc - an arbitrary date - civilization was well-established east of the
Fertile Crescent and Egypt. Both India and China had by then evolved distinctive
patterns of civilized life. Whatever their peripheral contacts with
lands further west, they were quite unlike earlier examples. Indigenous
cultures had created in those countries ways of thinking and behaving
which were, over a huge area, very distinctive. They were the heartlands
of the two dominating geographical (and later cultural) divisions which
divide Asia east of Afghanistan and the Iranian highlands and south of
Siberia. The Indian zone is bounded by the Himalayas and their neighbouring
mountain ranges, the Burmese and Siamese highlands and the
shores of the Indonesian archipelago. The other, east Asian, zone principally
consists of the huge mass of China, but includes also Korea, Japan
and Indo-China. For most of historical times, the civilizations which
appeared in India and China tended to dominate these two big sub-divisions
of Asia. Immensely varied in terrain, climate and geography, they
contain some of the greatest rivers in the world, all of which - the Indus,
Ganges, Brahmaputra, Mekong, Yangtze and Yellow rivers - drain vast
quantities of water from the inner Asian highlands. TWo provided valleys
which were to be the sites of Asia’s first civilized life.
Looked at a little more closely, the Indian sub-continent is about the
size of Europe. It was for a long time virtually isolated by geography. Until
the sixteenth century, India has rarely been invaded except by the passes
of the north-west. The mountains there - and still more those further
north - are some of the highest in the world; to the north-east lay belts of
jungle. On its other two sides,, the Indian peninsula looks out on the huge
expanses of the Indian ocean. This has given it a very distinctive and
varied, but tropical climate. The northern mountains keep away the worst
of the icy winds of Central Asia (though north India can be bitterly cold in
winter) but the long coasts are open to the rain-laden clouds which roll in
from the oceans to water the arid plains of northern India in the annual
monsoon. This sets India's climatic and therefore agricultural clock, bringing
rain during the hottest months of the year, and ensures that the southern
highlands of the Deccan remain heavily forested. Agriculture seems to
have established itself first in the north-western alluvial plains of the
Indus.
China's cultural zone is even larger. It is itself bigger than the United
States; from Peking to Hong Kong, more or less due south, is 1,200 miles
as the crow flies. Its huge expanse contains many climates and many
regions. In summer the north is scorching and arid while the south is
humid and subject to floods; the north looks bare and dustblown in the


winter, while the south is always green. Civilization in China has tended
always to spread from north to south and to be stimulated by currents
from Mongolia and Central Asia. The major topographical divisions of this
vast country are set by three great river valleys which drain the interior
and run across the country roughly from west to east. They are, from
north to south, the Hwang-Ho, or Yellow River, the Yangtze and the Hsi.
Until the coming of the European, they did not help to link China to the
outside world. She was long as isolated as India. Much of China is mountainous
and except in the extreme south and north-east her frontiers still
sprawl across and along great ranges and plateaux. The head-waters of the
Yangtze, like those of the Mekong, lie in the high Kunlun, north of Tibet.
These highland frontiers are great insulators. The arc they form is broken
only where the Yellow River flows south into China from inner Mongolia.

EARLY INDIAN CIVILIZATION
Civilization in India is older than in China, but has a more disjointed history.
In some ways, ancient India is with us still, visible and accessible as
in no other early centre of civilization. At the beginning of this century,
many Indians still lived as all our primeval ancestors must once have
lived, by hunting and gathering. The bullock-cart and the potter’s wheel of
many villages today are, as far as can be seen, identical with those used
four thousand years ago. Gods and goddesses whose cults can be traced to
the Stone Age are still worshipped at village shrines. Social arrangements
whose main lines were set well before 1000 bc still regulate the lives of millions
of Indians, Christians and Moslems as well as Hindus.
The dark-skinned peoples of the type called Dravidian, whose descendants
are now mainly to be found in south India, lived also in the north
about five thousand years ago. They may even have been the aboriginal
Indians, though we cannot be sure. Many peoples have entered the subcontinent
through the passes of the north-western mountains; perhaps
some other ethnic movement may have touched off civilization in the
Indus valley, where agriculture began in India and where there is the first
evidence of pottery made on a wheel. But no one can say for certain.
Although the idea that Indian civilization was taken from the Near East has
attracted some scholars, it may simply be that Indians arrived at civilization
for themselves, as the Mesopotamians had done.
The evidence that civilization had appeared in India by about 2500 bc
has been provided by archaeologists working at forty or fifty sites - among
them, the ruins of two whole cities, at Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, both
close to the Indus, but about four hundred miles apart. They were big and
impressive places, perhaps containing thirty thousand people each at
their greatest extent and between two and two and a half miles in circumference.
Obviously, the Indus valley could not have been at that date the
arid region it later became, because civilization on such a scale (and
‘ Harappan ’ civilization, as it is called, stretched over a very wide area).


would have demanded a very productive agriculture. There must also
have been ways of controlling the Indus, always prone to flood, with
drainage and irrigation systems, before city life could emerge. That suggests,
in turn, high levels of organizational, administrative and technological
skill. One crucial invention may have been baked brick, the material
of which the Harappan cities are built. Unlike the sun-dried brick of
Mesopotamia, this would provide good material for flood-control in a
valley lacking stone. Baked brick could be used for dams, culverts and
canals.
There were docks, too, one at Lothal being connected by a mile-long
canal to the sea. Such evidence of trade with the outside world (perhaps in
cotton goods, of whose existence this civilization provides the earliest evidence)
reinforces the impression of wealth left by the remains of the cities
themselves. Each had a citadel and residential areas with houses laid out
regularly on a grid pattern. The streets were not paved, but the houses
were solidly built of standardized brick and were well-provided. Brick
lined sewers carried away water from washplaces and latrines, with covered
man-holes for cleaning and inspection. Rubbish shoots from the
houses collected other kinds of waste. Large baths or tanks in public
places, like those of countless Indian villages today, have also been discovered.
These may not have been only for water; together with the evidence
of the attention to sanitation they suggest that the lasting emphasis
of Indian religion on bathing and the ritual ablution of later Hinduism may
have very ancient origins.
Harappan civilization was literate. Its writing is to be found on thousands
of seals which seem to have been used for marking bundles of goods
sold abroad, as well as a few fragments of pottery. The calligraphy - 
a pictographic form - has not yet yielded much to scholarly inquiry, beyond a
suggestion that the Harappan language was akin to Dravidian tongues still
surviving in southern India. Literacy was, nonetheless, clearly important
in the working of an effective and far-ranging system of administration.
Weights and measures seem to have been standardized over a wide area
and large, surely public, granaries were built in the cities. Anchor-stones
found in the dock at Lothal show that big vessels docked there, and traces
of the seals used on bundles of goods have turned up as far away as the
upper end of the Persian gulf: Harappan commerce was far-ranging. It is
known, too, that ideas and techniques from the Indus spread throughout
Sind and the Punjab, and down the west coast of Gujarat. The process took
centuries, though, and the picture revealed by archaeology is at present
too confused for a clear picture to emerge.

Aryan India
Within a couple of centuries after 2000 bc, Indus civilization came to an
end. Why, we do not know. Some hold that it may have been a victim of an
early manmade environmental disaster. Perhaps it arose from excessive
tree-felling to feed the brick-kiln fires and so to the wrecking of the


delicate balance of agriculture on the banks of the Indus. Or, clearing for
cultivation or pasture may have caused erosion and dessication and a collapse
of productivity. If either or both of these occurred, they would have
made control of the devastating Indus floods and alterations of course -
always potential hazards - much harder. We really do not know.
There is also the possibility that another force was at work, adding to
the troubles of a land already devastated by over-exploitation of the environment,
and it has attracted support because it may link Indian history to
major disturbances elsewhere. Harappan civilization seems to come to an
end in about 1750 bc. That coincides strikingly with the irruption into the
sub-continent of a new group of invading peoples, the so-called Aryans.
They were 'Indo-European' and, like that word, ‘Aryan’ is a linguistic term.
But it has customarily and conveniently been specially applied to one
group of the Indo-European peoples who began to enter India from the
Hindu Kush in about 2000 bc, at about the time when other Indo-Europeans
were flowing into Iran. This was the beginning of centuries during
which waves of these migrants washed deeper and deeper into the Indus
valley and the Punjab.
Eventually, they reached the upper Ganges. Scholars do not favour the
idea that they alone destroyed the valley cities, nor did they obliterate the
native peoples, but no doubt much violence marked their coming, for the
Aryans were warriors and nomads, armed with bronze weapons, bringing
horses and chariots. In the Indus cities, skeletons have been found which
suggest struggle. There are plenty of signs, though, that elsewhere the
native population lived beside the newcomers keeping their own beliefs
and practices alive and producing some fusion of Harappan with later
ways.
The Aryans had no culture so advanced as what they found. Writing
disappears with their arrival, not emerging again until the middle of the
first millennium bc; cities, too, have to be re-invented, and when they
appear again lack the elaboration and order of their Indus valley predecessors.
The Aryans seem only slowly to have given up their pastoral
habits and settled to agriculture, spreading east and south from their original
settlement areas in a sprawl of villages. This took centuries. Not until
the coming of iron was it complete and the Ganges valley colonized. By
then, Aryan culture had nevertheless made decisive contributions to


Indian history.
The first was to lay the foundations of Indian religion. Their own centred
on sacrificial concepts; through sacrifice the process of creation
which the gods achieved at the beginning of time was to be endlessly
repeated. Agni, the god of fire, was very important, because it was through
his sacrificial flames that men could reach the gods. Great importance and
standing was given to the brahmans, the priests who presided over these
ceremonies. Among other deities, two of the most important were Varuna,
god of the heavens, controller of natural order and the embodiment of justice,
and Indra, the warrior god who, year after year, slew a dragon and


thus released again the heavenly waters which came with the breaking of
the monsoon. We learn about them and others in the Rig-Veda, a collection
of more than a thousand ' Vedic ' hymns performed during sacrifice, which
was accumulated over centuries.
The Rig-Veda seems to reflect an Aryan culture already changed by settlement
in India and not Aryan culture as it had existed at earlier times. It
was at first passed on as oral tradition, and its sanctity made its exact memorization
essential. It was still almost certainly largely uncorrupted from
its original form (first put together in about 1000 bc) when first written
down at some time after ad 1300. Together with later Vedic hymns and
prose works, it is the best source of information for Aryan India, whose
archaeology is cramped for a long time because the Aryans built in wood,
not the brick of the Indus valley cities.
The India described in the Rig-Veda stretches from the western banks
of the Indus to the Ganges. Within it Aryan peoples and dark-skinned
native inhabitants lived side by side in societies whose fundamental units
were families and tribes. In them certain social patterns of Aryan origin
were to prove of enduring importance. Their basis is now called caste.
Along with their religion, and their language, Sanskrit (which is the basis
of Indian languages still spoken today), the caste system is the major
legacy of Aryans to later India. Castes, as they evolved, became groups of
people following the same occupation and alone entitled to do so. Membership
of caste is hereditary and, ideally, caste members marry only with
one another, share special ritual practices and obligatory acts and, if strict,
will only eat food prepared by other members of the same caste. There
eventually came to be hundreds of castes and sub-castes. As society
became more complex, more and more marriage and eating taboos were
codified. The demands of the system eventually became a primary regulator
of Indian society, and in many Indians’ lives the most significant. By
modern times, thousands of local and occupational castes, together with
the ties of tribe, family and locality, formed a structure of power in Indian
society as influential as formal political institutions and centralized
authority have ever been.

The system had begun with a simple division of Aryan society into
three classes: brahmans, warriors and farmers. These were not at first so
closely defined nor so exclusive as they later became; for some centuries,
it appears, people could move from one caste to another. The only unleapable
social barrier in early times seems to have been that between Aryans
and non-Aryans. A fourth social class seems to have been singled out
rigidly; this contained the original native population, darker-skinned than
the invaders, who wanted to keep separate from them and therefore saw
them as outside the three-class system altogether. The non-Aryans, members
of the new fourth class, became the ' unclean '; because they were non-Aryans
they could not take part in religious sacrifices, or study or hear the
Vedic hymns. In the end, these ' unclean ', originally identified from a wish
to preserve ethnic purity, became the ' untouchables ’ of modern India, a

class to which is left the dirty work of cleaning and scavenging, so looked
down upon that some brahmans still feel that the shadow of a sweeper
falling across food pollutes it.

Early Aryan tribal society already had kings and by about 600 bc there
was a scatter of sixteen or so kingdoms well established in the Ganges
valley. This was the outcome of centuries of steady pressure eastwards
and south-eastwards. Peaceful settlement and intermarriage seem to have
played as big a part in it as conquest, though exactly how cannot be confidently
disentangled from mythology. Gradually, during this era, the
centre of gravity of Aryan India shifted from the Punjab to the Ganges
valley as Aryan culture was adopted by the peoples already there. That
was already by the seventh century bc the major centre of Indian population;
perhaps the cultivation of rice made this possible. A second age of
Indian cities began, the earliest of them market-places and centres of
manufacture, bringing together specialized craftsmen. The great plains,
together with the development of larger and better-equipped armies (we
hear of the use of elephants), favoured the consolidation of larger political
units. The existence of coinage and the rediscovery of writing make it
likely that they had governments of growing solidity and regularity.
Something about them and the great names involved can be found in later
documents, above all in two great Indian epics, the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata, whose texts were for the first time written down as we
know them in about ad 400.

Whatever the local characteristics of the Indian cultures, Aryan civilization
continued to spread. After advance towards Bengal down the
Ganges valley, it moved south along the west coasts towards Gujarat, and
then towards the central highlands of the sub-continent. There, Aryan settlement
seemed to stop. The Deccan has always been cut off from the
north by jungle-clad hills, the Vindhya. Internally, too, the south is broken
and hilly, and this did not favour the building of large states. Instead, south
India remained fragmented, some of its peoples persisting, thanks to their
inaccessibility, in the hunting and gathering cultures of a tribal age. But
there is a danger of distortion. The written evidence and the classical texts
make it all too easy to forget the existence of the non-Aryan half of the subcontinent.
Such archaeological evidence as there is from the south shows
a clear and continuing cultural lag even in the early period between the
area of the Indus system and the rest of the sub-continent, to which the
river was to give its name. In the south, bronze and copper only begin to
appear well after the Aryan arrival in the north. Once outside the Indus
system, too, there are no metal sculptures, no seals and fewer terracotta
figures from pre-Aryan times. The survival of Dravidian languages in the
south shows the region's persistent isolation.
Estimates of ancient populations are notoriously unreliable but India's
has been put at about 25 million by 500 bc, which may have been roughly
a quarter of the whole population of the world at that time. India's early
history nevertheless is important because of its continuing effect in
