BEGINNINGS

History is a word which traditionally means two different things: what
happened, and a true account of what happened. In the second sense, it is
always a selection from the past. Even the history of the whole world,
though, is not a selection from all the past. We can ignore most of Time. We
need not go back to the ' Big Bang ' from which our universe emerged in
order to understand where we are now. History is the story of human
beings, and it is the human past which concerns us. Even when historians
look at things beyond human control, such as geography, climate and, for
immense tracts of time, disease, they do so only because that helps to
explain why men and women lived and died in some ways rather than
others. Or, to put it another way, history in the first sense - what happened
- is what happened to and has been done by humans.

This cuts down the past we have to deal with by quite a lot, but still
leaves an enormous amount to be tackled. Nor does it make it very clear
where we are to begin. In theory, it could be with the first human being.
But we do not know when or where he or she appeared, even if we can
make responsible guesses within fairly broad limits. And, to make things
more difficult, not everyone agrees about what sort of creatures in early
times might be thought of as ' human '; and where the line between them
and other animals is crossed.

A clear line is very hard to draw. People do not now talk (as they once
did) about ' ape - men ' and ' missing links '. Physiology helps us to classify
data but what we call ' human ' is still a matter of a definition and disagreement
is possible. What is surely and identifiably unique about humans is
not just their possession of certain characteristics, but what they do with
them. What human beings have always shown is a cumulative capacity
such as no other species has ever shown to create change. They have made
their own history - though, of course, within limits. Those limits are now

very wide indeed, though once they were so narrow that we cannot pick
out the first step which took human evolution away from the determination
of nature. Human history began when the inheritance of genetics and
behaviour which had until then provided the only means of survival was
first broken through by conscious choice.

Once there was any power to break free, in however small a degree,
from the determinism of nature, a huge difference had been made. From
that point, human culture was progressive; it was increasingly built by
deliberate selection within it as well as by accident and natural pressure,
by the accumulation of a capital of experience and knowledge, and by
exploiting it. That is really the place where our story should start, if we
could identify it.

Evolution
Most biologists nowadays accept some form of a hypothesis which
accounts for evolution by ‘ natural selection ’. Not all do, but many would
agree that evolution operates through environment, a particular environment
favouring the survival of some genetic strains, and disfavouring
others. Genetic messages which are favoured are carried forward into the
next generation: those which are disfavoured are not, because the environment
eradicates them before the genetic inheritance has been passed on.
For example, certain mechanisms for conserving body heat exist in some
species which enable them to go on living in cold climates - penguins, for
example. Other species without those mechanisms cannot survive in
those climates, and so they are only to be found elsewhere, where they
can.

This may seem remote from the human story, but it is necessary to an
understanding of its roots in a very distant past. Biological evolution long
inched forward with incredible slowness within the possibilities offered by
diverse habitats, at first to different organisms and later to different animals.
The deciding factor in making these different habitats available was
climate. About forty million years ago a long climatic phase began to draw
to a close which had favoured great reptiles - of which the dinosaurs are
the most celebrated. The world was growing colder. As new climatic conditions
restricted their habitat, the great reptiles disappeared (some
believe that other factors than climate were at work). But the new conditions
suited other animal strains which were already about, among them
some mammals whose tiny ancestors had appeared two hundred million
years or so earlier. They now inherited the earth, or a considerable part of
it. With many breaks in sequence and accidents of selection on the way
these strains were themselves to evolve into the mammal families of
today, among them our own.


This is by no means the end of the story of climate as an evolutionary
selector. Although they took hundreds of millennia, even millions of
years, to run their full course, huge swings of temperature still occurred.
The resulting extremes, of freezing on the one hand and aridity on the

other, choked off some possible lines of development. Conversely, in other
times and places, the onset of appropriately benign conditions allowed
some species to flourish and encouraged their spread into new habitats. In
this immensely long process and even before the appearance of the creatures
from which humanity was to evolve, climate was both setting the
stage on which human history would take place and shaping, by selection,
the eventual genetic inheritance of humanity itself.

Fifty-five million or so years ago, primitive mammals were of two main
sorts. One, rodent - like, remained on the ground; the other took to the
trees. The competition of the two families for resources was thus lessened.
Strains of each survived to become eventually creatures we know today.
The second group are now called the prosimians. We are among their
descendants, for they were the ancestors of the first primates. What survived
in the next phase of evolution were genetic strains among the
prosimians which were best suited to the special uncertainties and accidental
challenges of the forest.

The risky, sometimes sun - dappled forest environment put a premium
on the capacity to learn. Strains prone to accident in such conditions were
wiped out. Those whose genetic inheritance could respond and adapt to
the surprising, sudden danger of deep shade, confused visual patterns,
and treacherous handholds survived. Among those which prospered
(genetically speaking) were some species with long digits which were to
develop into fingers and the oppositional thumb which makes it easy to
grasp a branch - and, later, a tool. Others evolved towards three - dimensional
vision, a diminished sense of smell, and the characteristic anthropoid face.
This story need not be followed further in details (it is not only
highly complicated, but one still much open to debate among specialists).
It is the necessary background, though, to the understanding of one of the
outcomes, the main branch of the primate family to which humans
belong, the hominids.

Hominids
The first apes and monkeys - then the most highly developed primates -
appeared 25 million or so years ago. They had much bigger bodies and
brains than the earlier primates. Among them evolved some strains particularly
well - suited to the savannahs which, as a result of climatic
change, were beginning to encroach on the forests. These creatures were
better able to cope with new conditions than the ‘ pongids ’, as the
ape / monkey families are termed. Some of them walked upright and
could run in a way an ape cannot. From them evolved the evolutionary
line called ‘ hominids ’. Fossil remains suggest that between three and four
million years ago we can begin to distinguish among them some who can
be reckoned among our ' ancestors ’. The earliest traces come from south
and east Africa. In what is now ' Tanzania, at a place called the Olduvai
gorge, discoveries in the 1950s turned earlier ideas about the origins of
mankind topsy - turvy. For the next forty years scholars went on extending

by new discoveries the time - span within which to argue about human
origins. There were to be many other important discoveries in Africa and
the conclusions first drawn are now very much questioned. But the
remains found in the Olduvai gorge are still the best starting - point for any
account of what we know.

They were not at first sight very impressive. A deal of searching produced
only a collection of bits and pieces which could all be got on to a
large table. Over a thousand teeth were found and a dozen or so skulls, but
only three hipbones and one shoulder - blade, and a scatter of other bones.
Nonetheless, these were the relics of creatures of a type hitherto
unknown. It was labelled ‘ Southern African ape ' - Australopithecus
africanus in the scientific classification system - and it looked as if these
particular specimens were between two and three million years old.

Australopithecus was about four feet tall and had hips, legs and feet
more like those of humans than those of apes. The skull was fairly ape - like,
though, held a brain about as big as that of a gorilla, and had a massive
jaw. The forelimbs ended in true hands, with fingertips that flattened at
the end like human fingers. What is more, some deductions about behaviour
can be made; there was evidence of habitation in the same place for
long periods and some scholars have also thought that Olduvai provides
the first evidence of hominid building, in the shape of a windbreak of
stones. Evidently, the creatures who lived there were meat - eaters, for
there were smashed bones about which had been broken up so that their
marrow and the brains from skulls could be got at. As there was no fire to
cook them, they must have been eaten raw. The meat was probably not
very attractive, because it is likely that it was carrion found by scavenging,
but that it was eaten at all is very important. For one thing, meat is a concentrated
food, so that those who eat it do not have to eat so continuously
or often. For another, it presented technical problems; smashing bones
and cutting off strips of skin or flesh cannot have been easy for creatures
descended from vegetarians and therefore without the sharp teeth and
claws of some mammals. They would need some help in solving these
problems. That may explain one of the most exciting discoveries made at
Olduvai: Australopithecus was a tool - maker.

Human qualities
Excavation revealed that different kinds of stone had been brought to
Olduvai after being picked up elsewhere. So, they had been selected. By
chipping flakes off them to give a jagged edge, they had then been turned
into crude choppers which could be held in the hand - the first consciously
made cutting tools. Here, about two million years ago, technology begins.
Olduvai is the first landmark in the long, slow spreading across the world
of purposefully made implements. They were to be refined, improved and
enormously multiplied, but stone tools provided for most of human prehistory
and even for most of the time our own species has existed the main
equipment for dealing with the environment.

Many problems about what was found at Olduvai remain unsettled;
above all, that of deciding whether these creatures really are part of
human ancestry at all. They are certainly hominids but they may belong
to another strain than that from which we descend, only our remote
cousins, so to speak, instead of our direct progenitors. Though they share
some characteristics with later humans, they were also very different - in
the shape of their skulls, for example, and their small stature. Some argue
that there is a common ‘ancestor’ in some other strain, further back, from
which both we and Australopithecus descended. But this debate is probably
less important than another: where do they come on the scale of evolution?
Have we really reached with them some elementary kind of human
being? Another way of putting this would be to ask when prehistory begins
and natural history is left behind. But such questions are largely about definitions:
answering them depends on what you have chosen to regard as
the essence of being human.

Some people have said it is a matter of language. But other animals
make noises which are signals, or appear to gesture: when does this
become language? As for building, ants, bees, birds and beavers do it very
impressively. Another suggested criterion is tool - using. This, too, is not
something which is absolutely confined to human beings. People have
observed apes using sticks to poke at insects' nests or to help them to reach
objects out of their grasp. Yet the very few higher primates other than
humankind which have been seen to use tools do so only in a very simple
way (as these examples suggest) and they do not seem to make tools with
a sense of purpose and the idea that a future benefit will result; perhaps
tool - making is a better test. Man is the only creature whom we know to
think deliberately about possible changes in the environment and ways to
produce them.

The Olduvai evidence suggests one reason for thinking that the early
inhabitants of that site were different in kind from other primates. Since
stones, and probably meat too, were brought there from some distances,
and since it also seems likely that because of their physique the offspring of
Australopithecus could not cling to their mothers for foraging expeditions as
do those of other primates, we may have at Olduvai the first known example
of creatures with a home base. Among the primates, only human beings
have places where the females and young stay for long periods while the
males search for food and bring it back to them. This has suggested something
else about the mind of Australopithecus, too: however crudely and
vaguely, these creatures seem to have been able to exercise some forethought,
resisting the temptation to break up their food and eat it where it
was found, and showing enough self-control to carry it home for consumption.
The curbing of natural impulses with future satisfaction in view lies at
the roots of everything humanity has achieved. It is the mechanism psychologists
call ‘ inhibition ’. This is the faint beginning of conscious planning.

But later discoveries have now complicated matters further. Australopithecus
now seems to have existed in several species and elsewhere in
