BEGINNINGS

History is a word which traditionally means two different things: what
happened, and a true account of what happened. In the second sense, it is
always a selection from the past. Even the history of the whole world,
though, is not a selection from all the past. We can ignore most of Time. We
need not go back to the ' Big Bang ' from which our universe emerged in
order to understand where we are now. History is the story of human
beings, and it is the human past which concerns us. Even when historians
look at things beyond human control, such as geography, climate and, for
immense tracts of time, disease, they do so only because that helps to
explain why men and women lived and died in some ways rather than
others. Or, to put it another way, history in the first sense - what happened
- is what happened to and has been done by humans.

This cuts down the past we have to deal with by quite a lot, but still
leaves an enormous amount to be tackled. Nor does it make it very clear
where we are to begin. In theory, it could be with the first human being.
But we do not know when or where he or she appeared, even if we can
make responsible guesses within fairly broad limits. And, to make things
more difficult, not everyone agrees about what sort of creatures in early
times might be thought of as ' human '; and where the line between them
and other animals is crossed.

A clear line is very hard to draw. People do not now talk (as they once
did) about ' ape - men ' and ' missing links '. Physiology helps us to classify
data but what we call ' human ' is still a matter of a definition and disagreement
is possible. What is surely and identifiably unique about humans is
not just their possession of certain characteristics, but what they do with
them. What human beings have always shown is a cumulative capacity
such as no other species has ever shown to create change. They have made
their own history - though, of course, within limits. Those limits are now

very wide indeed, though once they were so narrow that we cannot pick
out the first step which took human evolution away from the determination
of nature. Human history began when the inheritance of genetics and
behaviour which had until then provided the only means of survival was
first broken through by conscious choice.

Once there was any power to break free, in however small a degree,
from the determinism of nature, a huge difference had been made. From
that point, human culture was progressive; it was increasingly built by
deliberate selection within it as well as by accident and natural pressure,
by the accumulation of a capital of experience and knowledge, and by
exploiting it. That is really the place where our story should start, if we
could identify it.

Evolution
Most biologists nowadays accept some form of a hypothesis which
accounts for evolution by ‘ natural selection ’. Not all do, but many would
agree that evolution operates through environment, a particular environment
favouring the survival of some genetic strains, and disfavouring
others. Genetic messages which are favoured are carried forward into the
next generation: those which are disfavoured are not, because the environment
eradicates them before the genetic inheritance has been passed on.
For example, certain mechanisms for conserving body heat exist in some
species which enable them to go on living in cold climates - penguins, for
example. Other species without those mechanisms cannot survive in
those climates, and so they are only to be found elsewhere, where they
can.

This may seem remote from the human story, but it is necessary to an
understanding of its roots in a very distant past. Biological evolution long
inched forward with incredible slowness within the possibilities offered by
diverse habitats, at first to different organisms and later to different animals.
The deciding factor in making these different habitats available was
climate. About forty million years ago a long climatic phase began to draw
to a close which had favoured great reptiles - of which the dinosaurs are
the most celebrated. The world was growing colder. As new climatic conditions
restricted their habitat, the great reptiles disappeared (some
believe that other factors than climate were at work). But the new conditions
suited other animal strains which were already about, among them
some mammals whose tiny ancestors had appeared two hundred million
years or so earlier. They now inherited the earth, or a considerable part of
it. With many breaks in sequence and accidents of selection on the way
these strains were themselves to evolve into the mammal families of
today, among them our own.


This is by no means the end of the story of climate as an evolutionary
selector. Although they took hundreds of millennia, even millions of
years, to run their full course, huge swings of temperature still occurred.
The resulting extremes, of freezing on the one hand and aridity on the

other, choked off some possible lines of development. Conversely, in other
times and places, the onset of appropriately benign conditions allowed
some species to flourish and encouraged their spread into new habitats. In
this immensely long process and even before the appearance of the creatures
from which humanity was to evolve, climate was both setting the
stage on which human history would take place and shaping, by selection,
the eventual genetic inheritance of humanity itself.

Fifty-five million or so years ago, primitive mammals were of two main
sorts. One, rodent - like, remained on the ground; the other took to the
trees. The competition of the two families for resources was thus lessened.
Strains of each survived to become eventually creatures we know today.
The second group are now called the prosimians. We are among their
descendants, for they were the ancestors of the first primates. What survived
in the next phase of evolution were genetic strains among the
prosimians which were best suited to the special uncertainties and accidental
challenges of the forest.

The risky, sometimes sun - dappled forest environment put a premium
on the capacity to learn. Strains prone to accident in such conditions were
wiped out. Those whose genetic inheritance could respond and adapt to
the surprising, sudden danger of deep shade, confused visual patterns,
and treacherous handholds survived. Among those which prospered
(genetically speaking) were some species with long digits which were to
develop into fingers and the oppositional thumb which makes it easy to
grasp a branch - and, later, a tool. Others evolved towards three - dimensional
vision, a diminished sense of smell, and the characteristic anthropoid face.
This story need not be followed further in details (it is not only
highly complicated, but one still much open to debate among specialists).
It is the necessary background, though, to the understanding of one of the
outcomes, the main branch of the primate family to which humans
belong, the hominids.

Hominids
The first apes and monkeys - then the most highly developed primates -
appeared 25 million or so years ago. They had much bigger bodies and
brains than the earlier primates. Among them evolved some strains particularly
well - suited to the savannahs which, as a result of climatic
change, were beginning to encroach on the forests. These creatures were
better able to cope with new conditions than the ‘ pongids ’, as the
ape / monkey families are termed. Some of them walked upright and
could run in a way an ape cannot. From them evolved the evolutionary
line called ‘ hominids ’. Fossil remains suggest that between three and four
million years ago we can begin to distinguish among them some who can
be reckoned among our ' ancestors ’. The earliest traces come from south
and east Africa. In what is now ' Tanzania, at a place called the Olduvai
gorge, discoveries in the 1950s turned earlier ideas about the origins of
mankind topsy - turvy. For the next forty years scholars went on extending

by new discoveries the time - span within which to argue about human
origins. There were to be many other important discoveries in Africa and
the conclusions first drawn are now very much questioned. But the
remains found in the Olduvai gorge are still the best starting - point for any
account of what we know.

They were not at first sight very impressive. A deal of searching produced
only a collection of bits and pieces which could all be got on to a
large table. Over a thousand teeth were found and a dozen or so skulls, but
only three hipbones and one shoulder - blade, and a scatter of other bones.
Nonetheless, these were the relics of creatures of a type hitherto
unknown. It was labelled ‘ Southern African ape ' - Australopithecus
africanus in the scientific classification system - and it looked as if these
particular specimens were between two and three million years old.

Australopithecus was about four feet tall and had hips, legs and feet
more like those of humans than those of apes. The skull was fairly ape - like,
though, held a brain about as big as that of a gorilla, and had a massive
jaw. The forelimbs ended in true hands, with fingertips that flattened at
the end like human fingers. What is more, some deductions about behaviour
can be made; there was evidence of habitation in the same place for
long periods and some scholars have also thought that Olduvai provides
the first evidence of hominid building, in the shape of a windbreak of
stones. Evidently, the creatures who lived there were meat - eaters, for
there were smashed bones about which had been broken up so that their
marrow and the brains from skulls could be got at. As there was no fire to
cook them, they must have been eaten raw. The meat was probably not
very attractive, because it is likely that it was carrion found by scavenging,
but that it was eaten at all is very important. For one thing, meat is a concentrated
food, so that those who eat it do not have to eat so continuously
or often. For another, it presented technical problems; smashing bones
and cutting off strips of skin or flesh cannot have been easy for creatures
descended from vegetarians and therefore without the sharp teeth and
claws of some mammals. They would need some help in solving these
problems. That may explain one of the most exciting discoveries made at
Olduvai: Australopithecus was a tool - maker.

Human qualities
Excavation revealed that different kinds of stone had been brought to
Olduvai after being picked up elsewhere. So, they had been selected. By
chipping flakes off them to give a jagged edge, they had then been turned
into crude choppers which could be held in the hand - the first consciously
made cutting tools. Here, about two million years ago, technology begins.
Olduvai is the first landmark in the long, slow spreading across the world
of purposefully made implements. They were to be refined, improved and
enormously multiplied, but stone tools provided for most of human prehistory
and even for most of the time our own species has existed the main
equipment for dealing with the environment.

Many problems about what was found at Olduvai remain unsettled;
above all, that of deciding whether these creatures really are part of
human ancestry at all. They are certainly hominids but they may belong
to another strain than that from which we descend, only our remote
cousins, so to speak, instead of our direct progenitors. Though they share
some characteristics with later humans, they were also very different - in
the shape of their skulls, for example, and their small stature. Some argue
that there is a common ‘ancestor’ in some other strain, further back, from
which both we and Australopithecus descended. But this debate is probably
less important than another: where do they come on the scale of evolution?
Have we really reached with them some elementary kind of human
being? Another way of putting this would be to ask when prehistory begins
and natural history is left behind. But such questions are largely about definitions:
answering them depends on what you have chosen to regard as
the essence of being human.

Some people have said it is a matter of language. But other animals
make noises which are signals, or appear to gesture: when does this
become language? As for building, ants, bees, birds and beavers do it very
impressively. Another suggested criterion is tool - using. This, too, is not
something which is absolutely confined to human beings. People have
observed apes using sticks to poke at insects' nests or to help them to reach
objects out of their grasp. Yet the very few higher primates other than
humankind which have been seen to use tools do so only in a very simple
way (as these examples suggest) and they do not seem to make tools with
a sense of purpose and the idea that a future benefit will result; perhaps
tool - making is a better test. Man is the only creature whom we know to
think deliberately about possible changes in the environment and ways to
produce them.

The Olduvai evidence suggests one reason for thinking that the early
inhabitants of that site were different in kind from other primates. Since
stones, and probably meat too, were brought there from some distances,
and since it also seems likely that because of their physique the offspring of
Australopithecus could not cling to their mothers for foraging expeditions as
do those of other primates, we may have at Olduvai the first known example
of creatures with a home base. Among the primates, only human beings
have places where the females and young stay for long periods while the
males search for food and bring it back to them. This has suggested something
else about the mind of Australopithecus, too: however crudely and
vaguely, these creatures seem to have been able to exercise some forethought,
resisting the temptation to break up their food and eat it where it
was found, and showing enough self-control to carry it home for consumption.
The curbing of natural impulses with future satisfaction in view lies at
the roots of everything humanity has achieved. It is the mechanism psychologists
call ‘ inhibition ’. This is the faint beginning of conscious planning.

But later discoveries have now complicated matters further. Australopithecus
now seems to have existed in several species and elsewhere in


East Africa evidence has recently been found of some other creatures
living at the same time which seem even more like later humans, at least
in physique. So australopithecines were not the only hominids on the
scene two or three million years ago. Because they seem much more manlike
in physical terms, some of the other creatures about at the same time
have therefore been given the family name of Homo (the Latin word for
man). One of them whose remains turned up a few years ago near Lake
Rudolf in Kenya seems to have been about five feet tall and to have had a
brain about twice the size of a modern chimpanzee.

It is not easy for laymen to pick their way among evidence that scholars
argue fiercely about it. And we ought never to forget that we are for the
most part at the mercy of what we are lucky enough to find. We do not
have to believe that what was found at Olduvai was typical of the rest of the
world, or even of East Africa, around 2,000,000 bc - it may just be what
happens to have survived. The picture could be transformed if other evidence
turned up. But at least it seems probable that the origins of mankind
are to be sought in Africa, where three (and perhaps four) million years
ago creatures of more than one species in some ways already like humans
lived. Some of them - the australopithecines in particular - seem to have
gone on to be very successful in biological terms; there is evidence that by
about 1,000,000 bc they could be found all over the world outside the
Americas and Australia.


Homo erectus
Though the story rapidly becomes very complicated after about 2,000,000
BC scholars have now become very good at making distinctions between
different hominids. What matters for our purpose, though, is simply to
note that the biological strain leading to humanity showed its superior efficiency
by the fact of surviving at all. Across climatic ups and downs spanning
millions of years, the survival and spread of species with human
characteristics show that however feebly developed they seem to us, they
adapted to changing conditions as many species could not. Though we are
talking of climatic changes which took tens of thousands of years, this was
rapid by comparison with the millions of years of much steadier conditions
which lay in the past and they included what we call the ' Ice Ages ',
each lasting between fifty and a hundred thousand years. They covered
big areas of the northern hemisphere (including much of Europe, and
America as far south as modern New York) with great ice sheets, sometimes
a mile or more thick. Scholars have now distinguished seventeen or
nineteen (there is argument about the exact number) such glaciations
since the onset of the first, over three million years ago. The most recent
came to an end some ten thousand years ago.

They had huge impacts on life and evolution. The slow onset of the ice
was decisive and sometimes disastrous for what lay in its path. Our landscapes
are still shaped by its scourings and gougings thousands of centuries
ago. The vast inundations which followed when the ice melted must

in their turn also have been locally catastrophic, destroying the habitats of
creatures which had adapted to the challenge of arctic conditions. Yet they
also created new opportunities; new species could spread into the areas
uncovered by the thaw. Possibly more important still for the global story of
evolution, though, were the coolings and warmings which took place thousands
of miles from the ice itself. New environments appeared; aridification
and the spread of grassland both transformed the life - chances of
existing species, some of which form part of the human evolutionary
story. Africa was far from even the greatest ice - fields.

Climate can of course still be very important today, but only locally,
and in a much shorter term; it no longer absolutely determines where the
human species can survive. In prehistoric times it did, and could be offset
only by slowly acquired physical and mental characteristics. Among the
hominids, some strains were better equipped than others to grapple with
nature and, in a measure, to master it. We can return to the human
thumb, whose remote origins have already been mentioned. It is a much
more useful and impressive instrument than we often remember. It can
be brought together with the first finger to hold very small objects, and it
can curl round the haft of a weapon or tool to give a good grip. It makes it
much easier to go in for tool-making (as well as playing the piano, painting
a picture, or hitch-hiking, of course). But the crucial human superiority
to other animals was probably a bigger brain. Perhaps this was what
allowed some hominids to take thought for the morrow. Together with the
existence of the home base, that made survival easier. Hominid children
take a long time to grow up and thoughtfulness and a home base made it
more likely that they would survive to become parents in their turn. Some
rest and possible recovery from sickness or accident also became possible.
However it worked, the upshot is clear; somehow the species with
the most ‘human’ characteristics were slowly screened somewhat from
nature’s harsh mechanism of evolutionary selection. Hitherto, nature had
worked by eliminating genetic strains unable to adapt physically to environmental
challenge. Once prudence, forethought and skill made it possible
for some of them to avoid disaster, a new force was at work in
selection - and it looks very much like what we call human intelligence.
It is at this junction, as it were, that we begin to look for the station at
which we get off for humanity. It provides the first signs of that positive,
conscious impact upon environment which marks the earliest human
achievements.

All such thoughts, though, are still very speculative. We must never
forget that we have very thin evidence for much of prehistory. Europe, for
example, has just one cave where tools similar to those of Australopithecus
in Africa have been found and they date from just over a million years
ago.

Not until we are well past that time, do we begin to have evidence of
another important step in human evolution. After appearing about
800,000 Bc, a creature of new physical type spread gradually over the

whole ' Old World ' (that is, the land-mass of Africa, Europe and Asia,
which is now separated from the Americas and Australasia) by about
250,000 BC. Its earliest forms are called Homo habilis (' clever man ’) and
later developments into another species have been called Homo erectus
(' upright man ').

The crucial difference between Homo erectus and earlier manlike creatures
is size - above all, size of brain. One strain among them developed a
brain about twice the size of Australopithecus and much nearer that of
modern man than the brain of any earlier hominid. There were other
large-brained manlike creatures about and pieces of some of them have
turned up as far away as China and Java, but it looks as if the type originated
in Africa and then spread to Europe and most of Asia. Scholars have
tried to measure how long this spread took. One theory is three or four
thousand years, during which Homo erectus spread on the average at something
like a mile a year northwards across what is now the Sahara and the
Near East to France. Though the species has left no fossil remains in
Europe, it lasted about ten times longer than has mankind as we know it.
Homo erectus can be traced by special tools: the so-called stone ' hand axe ’
is the most important evidence. By plotting the places where it is found,
scholars have discovered where the species flourished.


Hunting
In spite of the huge gaps in our knowledge, there can be no doubt that
Homo erectus was a very successful species. Where did its bigger brains
come from? Here are more mysteries, but it seems most likely that a
change in diet explains the emergence of a new physical type. Eating more
meat would have helped creatures with larger stature than the average to
survive and reproduce. This may well be connected with the appearance
of the first specialized skill; hunting.

The first meat-eaters seem either to have relied on small prey like reptiles
and rodents or to have eaten the carrion found where bigger animals
had died. Right at the beginning of the archaeological record, an elephant
and perhaps giraffes and buffaloes helped provide meat consumed at
Olduvai, but for long after this the bones of smaller animals vastly preponderate
in the rubbish. Scavenging for them must have been unreliable,
and changed into true hunting - big-game hunting, too - only very slowly.
But change it did and the consequences were very great. Alongside a
growth in the size of the animal remains found among the relics of
primeval diet can be seen a parallel growth in the size of the skulls of the
eaters. By about 300,000 bc elephants were being killed and cut up on the
spot; the remains of large numbers of these (at one site, about fifty) have
been found. Over the same period (and down to later times, too) the shape
of the teeth and jaws of manlike creatures slowly evolves from those of
predominantly vegetable-eating species. There is a chicken-and-egg
aspect to this. The better diet to be got from organized hunting was only
available to creatures already at least advanced enough to carry out such a

complicated operation. This once more shows the speeding-up of evolutionary
change. An enormous new range of capacities and skills comes
into being somewhere between 1,000,000 and 100,000 bc, and they made
the first human societies possible.

A NEW GRASP OF THE WORLD
Before big-game hunting could become possible someone had to know a
lot about animals' habits and to be able to pass this knowledge on to others,
both those engaged in the cooperative enterprise of hunting, and from
generation to generation. Some kind of speech, therefore, must have
existed. It has been argued that genetic selection which led to changes in
the shape of the brain favoured the development of language. How Australopithecus
communicated may never be known, but even lower primates
have ways of doing so. Perhaps the first steps in the organization of
language would have been the breaking up of calls like those of other animals
into particular sounds capable of re-arrangement. This would make
different messages possible. But other changes may have helped, too.
Better vision, a growing sense of the world as lots of separate objects, and
the making of new things (tools) were all going on simultaneously over
hundreds of thousands of years in which language was evolving. Together
they slowly made possible the coming of abstract thought (thinking about
things not actually present). And this trend must have been reinforced
when hunting made record and memory more important still.

A big range of techniques and skills was also needed for hunting. ' to
trap and kill such monsters as the mammoth or woolly rhinoceros with the
help only of weapons of stone or wood was enormously difficult. Numbers
and discipline were needed to drive them to a killing-ground favourable
because of a bog in which a weighty creature would flounder, or because it
offered good vantage points or secure platforms to the hunters. Once dead,
the victims presented further problems. With nothing but wood and stone
tools, they had to be cut up. The meat had then to be carried home.

Bigger meat supplies were a tiny step towards a little leisure; the consumers
were released temporarily from the drudgery of ceaseless rummaging
about for small, but continuously available, dollops of
nourishment and had time to do something else. They could add to the
existing technology. Besides making more elaborate, bifacial hand-axes.
Homo erectus has also left the first certain evidence of constructed
dwellings, the earliest worked wood, the first wooden spear and the earliest
container, a wooden bowl. Inventing things on this scale shows a pace
of development and a capacity quite different from what has gone before.
Minds were forming ideas of objects before manufacture was begun. Some
have even argued that simple forms (triangles, ellipses and ovals) used in
huge numbers of stone tools, can be seen as the first beginnings of art - the
production of objects giving pleasure because of their form, as well as
being useful.

The coming of fire
The greatest of the technical and cultural advances of Homo erectus was to
learn to manage fire. The earliest evidence of its use comes from China
(c. 600,000 Bc) but it does not show that fire could be made. Probably Homo
erectus never got so far. Still, that the species could make use of it was an
enormous gain, the most important single change in technology before
the coming of agriculture. It was the first chemical tapping of energy other
than by the conversion of food inside the body.

Many peoples have had legends of heroic figures or magical beasts
who first seize fire, often from the gods. Perhaps this reflects a dim
memory that the first fire was taken from a natural source, whether from
volcanic activity, an outbreak of natural gas, or a blazing forest. However
it was obtained, the use of fire was revolutionary - though we must
remember that it took hundreds of thousands of years to develop its full
impact. Immediately, it meant warmth and light, the conquest of the cold
and the dark and therefore the extension of the habitable environment
into them, even if only a little way at first. Families could survive in
colder regions than before, and could live in temperate zones with a little
more ease. By occupying caves whose darkness had previously made
them unusable, they were safer from the weather. Animals could now be
driven out of their lairs and kept out (perhaps this was how the idea came
of using fire to drive big game in hunting). Wooden spears could be hardened
in fires. Cooking became possible. As a result, eating became easier;
marrow can be sucked out of cooked bones but getting it out raw is a laborious
business. Gibbons and gorillas have to spend much of their time
simply chewing their raw food; cooking saved time, for food softened by
it did not have to be chewed so long. Time was thus made available to do
other things. More important still, substances indigestible in their raw
state could become sources of food; distasteful or bitter plants could
be made edible. This must have increased food supply (and therefore
made population growth a little easier). It may also have stimulated attention
to the variety and availability of plant life and so have launched the
science of botany and the art of cookery. Finally, in the long run, eating
cooked food helped to alter the shape of the face and the form of the
teeth.

Cooking would have encouraged further restraint on immediate
impulses, too: you put off eating and did not give way to immediate appetite
by swallowing raw food. The focus of the cooking fire as a source of light and
warmth would have brought people together around it after dark and
helped to make a group more aware of itself as a community. They would
have talked somehow; the development of language - of whose origins we
know little - must have speeded up in this setting. Finally, fire slowly
brought new distinctions between members of the group. At some point,
fire - bearers and fire specialists appeared, beings of awesome and mysterious
importance, for on them might depend life and death for the rest of the
group. They carried and guarded the great liberating tool, and controlled its

power to break up the iron rigidity and discipline of night and day and even
that of the seasons.
During the age of Homo erectus, then, fire had already a little offset the
pressures of the great external rhythms of the natural world on hominid
life. Life was already less dominated by routine and less automatic than it
had been for Australopithecus; it was now far removed from that of animals
merely programmed by instinct and genetic endowment. Homo erectus
could make choices. This is the best ground for saying that with this
species we are already on the human side of any definition of the difference
between apes and men, however cramped and miserable its life may
appear.


Early society
It is easier to form a picture of the material circumstances of ancient life
than of what was going on inside the bigger brains now grappling with
those circumstances. But looking at the material remains is really all that
we can hope to do. That can tell us something. It is worth thinking once
more about big game hunting. Once Homo erectus became dependent on
meat, he became a parasite on the herds of game - and therefore had to
follow them about, or explore new territory in search of them - and was
more likely to settle and multiply in some places than others. There home
bases would be established. Some of them seem to have been occupied for
thousands and thousands of years.

The family which lived in the home base was developing, too. The existence
of that base already made it likely that the future human family would
be very different from animal families. This became clearer as the predecessors
of Homo sapiens grew bigger. The larger heads required to accommodate
bigger brains, for instance, meant both that children would be
bigger before birth - and this was reflected in changes in the female pelvis
which permitted the birth of offspring with larger heads - and also that a
longer period of growth after birth was needed for children to mature. No
physiological change in the female could provide ante-natal accommodation
to protect them until physical maturity. Human children, in consequence,
unlike most mammals, whose offspring mature within months,
need maternal care long after birth. Prolonged infancy, dependence and
the support of children by the family and society during immaturity meant
that human families developed in a way very unlike the families of other
animals. Part of this was a result of genetic selection; large litters ceased to
be the way in which the survival of the species was assured. Instead,
human societies have learnt to give more and longer attention to the protection,
nurture and training of their young (now often running on into
their twenties). Sharper differences between the patterns of life of males
and females appeared. Hominid mothers were very much more tied down
than the mothers of other primates and fathers became more involved in
the provision of food by hunting, which demanded arduous and prolonged
activity in which the females could not easily join.


Another result of prolonged infancy was that learning and memory
became more and more important. Here too, we seem to cross a line with
Homo erectus. The genetic programming of humanity's predecessors is
somehow replaced by conscious learning about the environment and
reflexion on it. Somewhere a great change has occurred in which tradition
and culture - the things the members of a community learn from one
another - take over from physiological inheritance as a factor in evolutionary
selection, though we may never actually be able to say exactly
where this change occurs.

Of course the physiological inheritance still remains very important.
Clearly it mattered greatly to the future shape of human society, for
instance, that one particular genetic strain long ago gave our species a
unique sexual characteristic. Among all other mammals, both the sexual
attraction exercised by the female on the male and her fertility are
restricted to certain periods. We speak of animals as being 'on heat’ at
these times, and when they are in this condition their lives are very much
disrupted. If they had then to look after young, they could not possibly
continue to nurture them. Human females do not work like this and this is
very important. If they were like other animals, their slowly maturing offspring
would have often been neglected in infancy and could hardly have
survived. It may have taken a million years or so for a genetic strain with
a sexual characteristic which dispensed with 'oestrus’, as it is called, to
emerge, but once it did so, the consequences for the future development
of humanity were enormous and were to affect much else we take for
granted about the way we live. The fact that human females were continuously
attractive to human males (and not only so at periods when each
sex was being regulated by automatic mechanisms of attraction) must
have made individual choice a much more important factor in mating.
This is the beginning of a very long and obscure road which leads to later
notions of sexual love. 'Ibgether with the longer childhood and greater
dependency made possible by better food-gathering, it points ahead also to
the stable and enduring human family unit - father, mother and offspring
- who remain together and constitute a real community. This is an institution
which only humans have, even if not every human family is like
that and modern social arrangements often now tell against it.

Once more, though, we are much at the mercy of guesswork. We ought
to be very cautious. We can say little that is certain about the social life of
our predecessors. Yet it is difficult not to feel that (however slowly) what
happened to early hominids laid down the main lines of much of human
life long before humans like ourselves existed. Culture and tradition gradually
took over from genetic mutation and natural selection as the primary
source of change among the hominids - or, to put it another way, what was
learnt was becoming as important for survival as what was biologically
inherited. The groups with the best ' memories' of effective ways of doing
things and increasing power to reflect upon them would have carried forward
human evolution fastest. Attempts have been made to trace its

progress in the actual physiological evolution of the cortex, the mass of
cells making up the brain itself

Yet when we try to think about prehistoric mental processes, we can be
sure of little except that they were almost inconceivably different from our
own. All we can say is that the life of Homo erectus looks more like human,
than pre-human, life. Physically, the creature’s brain was of an order of
magnitude comparable to our own, even if its skull was somewhat differently
shaped. Homo erectus made tools in different styles in different
places, built shelters, took over natural shelter by exploiting fire, and sallied
forth from it to hunt and gather food. It did this in groups showing
some discipline and able to transmit ideas by speech, and founded on the
home base and a distinction between the activities of males and females.
There may even have been other specializations; fire-bearers, or old creatures
whose memories made them the databanks of their ' societies ’, could
in some measure be supported by the labour of others.

There is nothing to be gained by looking, though, for some prehistoric
dividing line. The evidence for one does not exist. All we can confidently
say is that things had turned out in a certain way. When one or more subspecies
of Homo erectus evolved at last into Homo sapiens, a new physical
type, a big achievement and heritage was already pretty secure in their
grasp. Individuals come naked into the world, but humanity did not. It
bore with it from the past all, indeed, that made it humanity.

HOMO SAPIENS
On the scale of prehistoric time our own species. Homo sapiens, has not
been about on earth for very long. Homo erectus exploited the world successfully
about ten times longer than we have done. But there are no firm
lines and for thousands of years many different species of hominids must
have lived on earth, the end of one branch of the family overlapping by
many generations the early generations of another. This is one reason why
it is difficult to date the next important hominid species, beyond saying
that it flourished somewhere between 250,000 and 50,000 bc. By the last
date it was about to give way to human beings recognizably like ourselves.

The Neanderthals
The story begins with the discovery in Europe of two skulls about a quarter
of a million years old. They were of a different shape from those of
Homo erectus and had yet bigger brains. Still, they were not much like
those of modern humans and they do not tell us much more than that
something other than Homo erectus already existed. Then an Ice Age
descends and no more relics of them or of other hominids turn up until
fossils appear from about 100,000 bc, in the middle of the next warm
period. These show a big step forward, for they are the first traces within
the family Homo of the species called sapiens. Strictly, it is called Homo
sapiens neandertalensis, being thus labelled after the place where the first

skull announcing its existence was found - the Neanderthal valley in Germany,
not far from Diisseldorf Neanderthals would have looked somewhat
`unlike most modern human beings, not having much of a chin and
being very thick-set in build. Indeed, the first skull found was so oddly
shaped that it was thought by some scientists to be the skull of a modern
idiot. Some modern people may somewhat resemble Neanderthals; we
need not exaggerate the differences, and we know they were right-handed,
like most modern humans, so there are similarities which go deep. The
crucial difference from earlier hominids is their bigger brains.

Because the Neanderthals cannot easily be linked to earlier hominids,
some people have been tempted to think they must have been in some
way cut off from them, perhaps by the ice. As more evidence has turned
up, though, it has become clear that they were very widely spread, from
western Europe and Morocco at one extreme, to China at the other, with
other settlements in the Near East, Iraq and Iran. The earliest Neanderthal
in China may indeed go back to 200,000 bc. At all events, they were certainly
living over much of Europe and Asia in about 80,000 bc, just before
the onset of another Ice Age (and one of the worst). Though they look
physically primitive to modern eyes, the Neanderthals were very successful,
much more capable and mentally more advanced than anything
which had appeared on earth before them. As the ice returned, they did
not go south but did their best to cope with the cold, moving into caves for
protection and using fires kept going in hearths dug in their floors. Caves
can hardly have been very comfortable places. Besides being smoky from
the fire (which probably burnt animal fat and bones as wood grew scarcer
in the new tundras produced by the glaciation), they would have become
smelly from the rubbish on the floor, and damp at the back, where the
fire's heat would not penetrate. But caves made it easier to survive. Those
chosen nearly always looked south so as to assure as much sunlight as possible,
and may have had skin curtains at their mouths in the winter
months.

This was putting technology to use in a new way. The Neanderthals
wore skins, too, and made better-shaped stone tools than earlier toolmakers.
The growth in power over nature suggests that they had complex
languages, though some scientists have argued that their skulls suggest
that those parts of the brain which deal with speech are not so well developed
as other parts. Yet they must have had some very advanced ideas -
and therefore words in which to express them because they also did something
else quite new; they buried their dead. Some graves show signs of
careful attention. Near Samarkand the body of a Neanderthal child was
buried inside a ring of animal horns; another grave, in Iraq, contained a
man’s body surrounded with masses of wild flowers and grasses placed
there before he was buried. Such things are important. Not only are they
the beginning of a long and rich line of evidence about the past obtained
by digging up graves, but because they suggest an enormous important
change in thinking. Why, after all, did the Neanderthals bury their dead?

The exact answer we do not and probably cannot know, but perhaps
some Neanderthals were beginning to experiment with ritual. They may
have sought to control nature by carrying out certain acts in order to make
things happen. Perhaps, even, these burials and the faint traces of rituals
involving animals which are to be found on other Neanderthal sites mark
the beginnings of religion. Someone may have already begun to believe in
another world, invisible but powerful, even one in which an afterlife
might be possible. We do not know. However we speculate, though, it
seems clear that with the Neanderthals we reach a new mental level. The
new indicators, like the size of the Neanderthal skull and the big brain it
held tell us these are humans, who can in some ways think abstractly - as
we can. They had a new order of mental resources with which to face the
challenges of the last Ice Age, to which they adapted successfully, lasting
long into the cold era. Probably they lived on besides other human stocks,
perhaps sometimes mating with them, perhaps contending with them,
though, they were in the end vanquished, genetically speaking.

They were supplanted by the branch of the family to which we belong.
Homo sapiens sapiens. It seems to have evolved separately from the Neanderthals
and to represent a different line of hominid descent, with lighter
skulls, smaller faces and straighter limbs. Its members are traceable first in
the Levant, the Near East and the Balkans between 50,000 and 40,000 bc.
Perhaps they advanced northwards and west as the ice retreated. By the
latter date they were well-established in western Europe (where Homo
sapiens has sometimes been called 'Cro-Magnon Man'). Arrival in the Far
East seems to have been later. Somewhere about 30,000 bc, too, humans
had crossed the Bering Strait after the retreat of the ice and thus entered
the Americas (until then, so far as we know, without hominid inhabitants).
For the next fifteen thousand years or so, their successors moved slowly
southward until human beings lived all over the later Americas. Meanwhile,
others had reached Australia, where the first human remains have
been dated to about 25,000 bc.

This was a huge achievement. No other primates had spread so widely.
Nor was any later to do so, except through human agency. Yet although
human beings spread throughout the world, and at a remarkable rate by
comparison with earlier species, for a long time there were not many of
them. One scholar has suggested that in 40,000 bc there were probably
only about 10,000,000 in all. (Others have suggested 20,000 at most for the
whole of France in Neanderthal times.) It was a world thus almost unimaginably
different from our own, yet one in which human beings had already
achieved amazing things and were showing more clearly than ever their
power to change it for themselves.

Physical type
In a biologist, human beings are all members of the same species. There
may be very little precise similarity between any two individuals (except
identical twins), and no animals vary individually in appearance so much

as we do. Nonetheless, we are all human beings. Striking divisions of
appearance among us - in colour of skin, shape of eyes and nose, straightness
or crinkliness of hair and so on - do not prevent human beings from
choosing partners with different physical features from their own and
from having children who in varying measure share physical features with
both parents. It is important to remember this, because at different times
some people have thought that the main differences of appearance
between human beings based on racial characteristics reflected deeper differences,
too, which were also part of their physical heritage. This is no
longer a favoured view, though it still has supporters. The differences in
the way different groups of people behave are very real, but their origins
now tend to be seen in circumstance, different traditions and ways of life
- in culture, all that they learn from their community - and not in a
genetic endowment like that of skin colour or shape of feature.

Such physical differences nonetheless still divide mankind into certain
large groups of markedly different appearance. Most people fall into one of
what were long and traditionally called the main ' races ’ of mankind, so far
as appearance goes. Though these divisions are not genetically absolute
and are now distrusted as liable to be the basis of unjust discriminatory
practice, they were what human beings actually saw and recognized for the
whole period of historical record. On this basis, and setting aside complex
distinctions which are for most purposes more important, the bulk of the
world’s population falls into three major groups, Negroid, Caucasoid and
Mongoloid. Negroid peoples are black or very dark skinned, usually have
woolly hair and vary much in stature. They often have broad, flattish noses
and thick lips. Most peoples of this physical type are to be found around the
equatorial regions of Africa, but others live across the Indian Ocean as far
away as New Guinea, Fiji, the Philippine islands and even Iksmania. Caucasoids,
too, were scattered at an early date over a broad area, to the north
of the Negroid peoples, in North Africa, Europe, western Asia. They have
often been called ‘white’, though their skins vary in colour from very fair
(so fair that it cannot tan) to deep brown. There are Caucasoids in India and
Ceylon who even have black skins, but otherwise are much like Europeans
in that they have relatively narrow noses and lips, straight or wavy hair and
a tendency to grow heavy beards. Similarly, the skin of the Mongoloids can
vary from yellow to dark brown. Their other characteristics are straight,
usually black hair, scanty beards, flattish faces and slanted, almond-shaped
eyes. Their main homelands are in central Asia, China and Japan, but they
also live in Malaysia and Indonesia. Some scholars believe that the original
American Indians, both north and south, were Mongoloid, but this is not
settled; the immigrants to the Americas of 20,000 or so years ago may have
belonged to groups more Caucasoid in physical character.


These three main groups are now so distributed about so much of the
earth, and have interbred so much, that mankind today is very complicated
in appearance, as well as genetic inheritance. There are, too, still
peoples elsewhere, notably in the southern hemisphere, who do not fit into

these three groups, notably the Australian aborigines, or the Bushmen of
the Kalahari desert. Of the way these major physical divisions of humanity
appeared, there is little than can be said. Except for its bones, the human
body does not keep well. Skin, fat, and other tissues all decay rapidly. We
can look at skulls from long ages ago, but bodies from which we can safely
make deductions about appearance are only available from a few thousand
years back. By then, the main distinctions of appearance were well - established.
It is probable, though, that the three major groups appeared in different
areas and spread out from them until they met the others and
sometimes mingled with them. But the basic mechanisms originally at
work were probably those of natural selection, by environment, of genetic
strains well-adapted to some areas, climates, diets, altitudes, latitudes, and
so on, once early humans had acquired the means of surviving there. In
cold climates, for example, Mongoloids are efficient biological machines
because they have more fat just under the skin than Caucasoids or
Negroids. Caucasoids, because they lived for the most part in more temperate
regions, did not need this; nor did they need the skin pigmentation
protecting black peoples against sunlight; the sun was not so fierce in
Europe and western Asia. This does not take us far. But we know also that
changes of diet and environment can produce striking changes in
physique and appearance in only a few generations. It seems likely, then,
that only after about 40,000 bc, in the era during which Homo sapiens
spread out to establish himself all over the globe and confront new conditions, 
did what we think of as the enduring physical differences between

humans appear. Only those differences made it possible for human life to
establish itself easily in some regions at all. When they did, they fairly soon
led to a racial distribution which remained fairly stable until only recently
- only since about ad 1500 has it changed much.

HUMANITY IN THE OLD STONE AGE

Most of the time human beings have been on earth falls in what has long
been called ' the Stone Age’, a fairly familiar term, but one used very
loosely, and one of three invented to talk about pre-history: the Stone,
Bronze and Iron ages. Scholars keep coming back to them because more
precise and complicated ways of describing prehistory have their own disadvantages.
They are based on the fact that mankind successively learnt
how to use stone, bronze and iron. In other words, they classify human
development; they get away from divisions of time based on rocks, biology
or climate such as geologists and palaeontologists employ and concentrate
on what human beings have done and the tools they use. But there are
some awkward things about this way of looking at the human past, useful
as it is. There are no clear endings and beginnings to such divisions. Even
very recently, the Stone Age was still going on in some parts of the world,
though only just. There are still a few people alive who live with tools not
much better than those of prehistoric men, though their numbers are
rapidly shrinking. Another awkwardness of the particular term ' Stone Age ’
is that it has to cover an enormous stretch of time, during much of which
we are not really sure whether we are dealing with humans in the full sense
at all, though we are certainly dealing with makers and users of stone tools
{Homo erectus, for example). Because of this, prehistorians have divided up
the Stone Age further still. We need not bother very much in this book with
most of the terms they use, but one of them, the ' Palaeolithic ' (or ' Old Stone
Age ’, from Greek words meaning old stones) takes up by far the greater part
of human prehistory and continues down to about 10,000 bc. This spans the
last really cold spell and the period during which Homo sapiens established
himself widely, a sub-division sometimes called the ' upper Palaeolithic ’
(because, archaeologically speaking, evidence about it tends to be found in
the upper levels of excavations). Over such a long period - perhaps 30,000
years - general statements about what life was like should be cautious.
Climates were very different in different parts of the world, fauna and flora
offered different opportunities and presented different challenges, and
human beings were all the time growing more diverse in the ways they did
things, in what we can call their traditional cultures.

Tool - making
It is certain, though, that the pace of change was very slow in the upper
Palaeolithic. There would have been little variety during most of it in the
way people lived except those imposed by the availability of food. Hunting
and gathering must have been the rule. Cro-Magnon Europeans seem to

have been especially expert as fishers and hunters, and developed new
techniques, with nets and barbed arrows. The tool - kit of Homo sapiens was
better than that of any predecessor and went on improving. Long before,
in pre-human times, the first cutting tools had been made of whatever suitable
material came to hand; examples of pebbles, quartzite and even fossil
wood have been found. But as time passed, flint was used more and more.
After hundreds of thousands of years, in some places it may even have
become somewhat scarce, because early methods of shaping it were very
wasteful. Sometimes nine-tenths of a lump had to be flaked away to give
an edge. In upper Palaeolithic times, primitive craftsmen began to work
out new ways of making flint tools. A core of flint rather like a tube or cone
was shaped in such a way that there could be flaked from it ' blades ’ of flint
whose sides were nearly parallel and with a pretty uniform thickness. Not
only was this economical, but such blades could be refined further to make
very thin and beautiful, tools. The best of these seem to have been made in
Europe and the Levant.

Among new and specialized tools thus made possible were chisels for
carving wood or bone called ‘burins'. They had narrow edges for cutting,
gouging and engraving, backed by broad edges to give them strength. They
must have helped the human advance into new regions, especially northward,
because they made it possible to use antlers or mammoth tusks for
spearheads and harpoons. Ivory and antler are stronger than wood and
more elastic than flint, and such implements lasted longer than earlier
ones. It has been suggested that burin-making (whose techniques can be
traced from Europe across the northern hemisphere as far as the Bering
Strait and Alaska) may have been what made possible human invasion of
the Americas. Burins are not found in the southern hemisphere, which
may be negative evidence of their special value in working materials
which provided food and clothing in cold climates. Another new flint - working
skill was the making of tiny flint 'blades' to be fitted to weapons
and other instruments made of wood or bone. One of them was the sickle
or reaping knife in use in several places by the end of the old Stone Age. It
does not show that people were growing crops, but that they had learnt to
recognize and collect certain wild grain plants. Animals were hunted more
easily, too, by hunters with bows and flint-tipped arrows, spears and spear -
throwers. These weapons were very important; the bow and spear - thrower
greatly increased the velocity - and therefore the range, accuracy and
killing-power - of missile weapons. Many of these things were made from
the new materials of bone, antler and wood. Some of them could be used
to tap new sources of food by making fish-hooks and harpoons from them.
Bone also made needles possible and very fine examples of them survive
from the last hunting cultures of the Palaeolithic.

Life styles
Much of this suggests, correctly, that there was more food available. Yet in
spite of this and in spite of a basic physical similarity to ourselves, people

in the Stone Age were still shorter and lighter than later humans. They
cannot have had a balanced diet (Neanderthals seem to have suffered from
vitamin deficiencies) and their meat must often have been semi-putrid.
Still, even today people like to eat game which is high. Probably few Stone
Age humans survived to reach forty. Those who did would have lived on to
a pretty miserable old age by our standards, racked by the pains of arthritis
and rheumatism, suffering from scurvy and threatened with death by
every broken bone or, even though they would not have had sugar to help
rot them as we do, by rotting teeth. This would go on being true for many
people in the world for a long time to come, of course.

Fire - using had greatly enlarged the choice of where to live. The first
evidence of fire - making dates from about 30,000 bc. It must have made life
easier. But clothes and man - made dwellings also show other ways of mastering
the environment in the upper Paleolithic. Without them it would
have been impossible for mankind to settle over the whole surface of the
globe as it has done. There were no textiles, but skins were cut into thongs
and strips which were then softened and made flexible in flint thong - shapers,
to provide clothes. The oldest clothed body which has been discovered
dates from about 35,000 bc. It was found in Russia and was dressed 
in fur trousers and a decorated shirt.

In the Upper Palaeolithic we also begin to see faint signs of purpose
- built dwellings. Other animals can build, but only in narrow, inherited
ways programmed by instinct. Human beings can build anywhere, adapting
style and technique to local climate, terrain and materials, and on
whatever scale suits their purposes. Probably the main materials used at
first for shelter (other than piled stones) were mud and reeds, which
quickly decay. Also, until the very end of the Old Stone Age humans had
to move about with the herds of game they hunted over the year, and
though this seems to have brought them back time and again to certain
caves which have traces of long occupancy, it did not leave permanent
building behind. Nevertheless, some remains of huts from about 9000 bc
have been found in the Near East. On the plains of eastern Europe (where
there were few caves) there seem to have been quite big dwellings with
frames made of mammoth bones or tusks covered in skins. They had
floors sunk two or three feet into the ground and were sometimes grouped
in settlements of some hundreds of people. This suggests the beginnings
of a new scale of social organization.

The first art
Clearly, humanity had come a very long way by the late Stone Age. One of
the most striking signs of it comes from a relatively small part of western
Europe, where we find the finest evidence we yet possess of the beginnings
of art. It begins with little stockpiles of red ochre collected by Neanderthals
about fifty thousand years ago. They have been much studied, but
we really do not know what they were for. The difficulty in talking about
the origins of art is that so little evidence survives of its first expressions.

It is a reasonable guess that early humans scratched patterns in mud,
daubed their bodies with colour, stuck flowers or feathers in their hair or
danced in complicated patterns as did later peoples - but, if they did, nothing
of that survives. A second difficulty is that we have no knowledge why
the humans who produced the first art which survives took the trouble to
do so. We do not know what they thought they were doing. In later, historical,
times many peoples have painted their faces and bodies, and have
done so for very different reasons. Some may have done this in ancient
times, whether for religious or practical (camouflage) reasons, or as a part
of their sexual culture, whether for pure fun or for its own sake. But what
the ochre was for, we are unlikely ever to know for sure. If archaeologists
thousands of years from now had as evidence of some twentieth - century
societies nothing but a few packets of eye shadow and lipstick tubes, they
would be hard put to it to say what the purpose of these substances might
be.

Nevertheless, from somewhere about 35,000 bc onwards we have a
pretty steady supply of data from Europe. It was produced over a long
period, until about 10,000 bc. Elsewhere, caves and rocks in Africa, for
example, also display lots of prehistoric painting and carving. But so far
nothing as old as European palaeolithic art has been found. Much of what
remains of it comes from a pretty restricted area, a number of sites in
south-western France and northern Spain. The oldest things found there
are little decorated and coloured objects, often of bone and ivory - carved
spear-throwers, for example. Often they have engravings of animals on
them. Then, in about 20,000 bc we begin a period perhaps 5,000 years long
- which has left a splendid series of paintings and carvings on the walls
and roofs of caves. Animals provide most of the subject-matter of these
decorations. The last phase of palaeolithic art follows this - the stag often
looming larger in the subject-matter - and finishes in a burst of decorated
tools and weapons. And then, puzzlingly, this tradition seems to die out
and there is no more really fine art for six thousand years.

This is a very impressive, but also a very mysterious survival. Many
guesses have been made about how it can be explained. The great
sequences of cave pictures have especially interested scholars. For one
thing, these are often put in out-of-the-way and difficult corners, and can
only have been painted or carved with the help of artificial light. Obviously
the huge predominance of animal subjects is important, too: the
palaeolithic artist did not spend his time on landscape or even very much
on human beings. Interestingly, human beings are shown always very
unrealistically, in an abstract, stylized way, whereas the animals are often
drawn with close attention to detail. Perhaps to draw something realistically
was to have power over it. Some scholars have tried to work out
patterns in the way certain animals repeatedly appear, but this does
not get us very far. It is a reasonable guess, though, that in societies without
writing, these patterns carried messages to those who looked at
them. Remembering the hints of burial practices in Neanderthal times.

it is tempting to think that religious or magical rituals went on in these
dark caves. Perhaps, if they did, they were connected with attempts to
influence the movements and behaviour of the game animals on which
early humans depended for their living. This would fit in with there being
more pictures of stags as time passed - the reindeer and mammoth of the
earlier sequences would have gradually died out as the ice slowly
retreated.

We really know very little about the first great art. There is enough of
it, nevertheless, to show that human beings in the late Palaeolithic were
capable of astonishing mental achievements and of observing the world
around them acutely. It may be that as they lost faith in their ability to
influence the behaviour of the animals - which was, though they did not
know it, determined by climate - so they lost the incentive to produce art.
It is unlikely that they practised art for its own sake, far less because
people would buy it, as in later times. But that it was art in the full sense of
careful, controlled, imaginative creation of beautiful and moving things,
appealing to us not only because of what can be done with them but
because of what they are, there can really be no doubt.

THE COMING OF AGRICULTURE
Art has to be paid for even when it is not bought; the people who carried
out the great cave-paintings, however simple their needs, could not go out
to look for food while they were engaged in their work. So some small surpluses over immediate need must have been available even in early hunting and gathering societies. The decisive step in making them bigger was
achieved when people learnt to grow and harvest crops, and to tame and
exploit animals. This was the discovery - or invention - of agriculture. It
must already be clear that the whole story of human beings is one of continual
change, much of it man-made, but some steps in that story stand out
as of quite special importance. Agriculture is one of them, like the mastery
of fire, or the coming of speech. It was almost the last of the great strides
made by mankind in pre-history; it changed life so much and so deeply
that nothing since would have been possible without it.

Different parts of the world achieved agriculture at different times. Climate
and physical setting must be the basic reason, and explain also why
some peoples arrived at agriculture on their own, but much later than the
Old World of Eurasia (in the Americas, for example), and why some never
got there at all without help from the outside (like prehistoric western
Europe). The oldest traces of cultivated plants are said to date from about
10,000 Bc and were found in south-east Asia; these were early forms of
millet and rice, both still important today in that region. About 8,000 years
later, people in central America learnt to grow a kind of sweet potato and
a primitive maize. Much more is known, though, about the early stages of
agriculture in the Near East, where, between about 9000 and 6000 bc many
of the cereal grains we still use became widespread.

The Fertile Crescent
People sometimes call the cracial area ‘the Fertile Crescent', an arc of territory
running up from the Nile delta, through Palestine and the Levant,
turning eastwards along the hills of Anatolia and finishing on the highlands
between Iran and the Caspian, the other side of the river valleys of
Mesopotamia. Much of it now looks pretty uninviting, but ten thousand
years ago good rainfall and fertile soil made it well-wooded, with its woods
full of game. The growth of forests as the last Ice Age rolled back was less
fierce than further north and they were easier to clear. The ancestors of
later cereals grew on the hills - wild barley, emmer (a wild wheat) and
many grasses. From this area newly discovered techniques of planting and
harvesting seem to have spread, both into south-eastern Europe and into
the Nile valley.

A possible time-scale is that in about 9500 bc people were harvesting
wild grasses and grains in Asia Minor; by 7000 bc the first planting and cultivation
had begun in the Levant and Mesopotamia; in the next three thousand
years these practices moved west as far as (roughly) the Rhine; and
by 3000 BC farming had reached western Europe and the British Isles. Elsewhere
new ways of raising food may have been arrived at independently,
but to the east and north of the Mediterranean they seem to have been
passed on by the neighbours.

Learning how to keep livestock had almost as revolutionary an effect
as growing crops. The dog had already been domesticated by the hunting
peoples of Europe, another big step in harnessing natural energy for
human use. The next was to round up wild animals and keep them in
herds, culling them for food, for their skins and wool, or for their antlers
and bones. There were plenty of animals about in the Fertile Crescent
which turned out to be highly manageable by man. Sheep and goats (or
their ancestors) were especially plentiful there, while pigs of a kind
lived wild almost world-wide. Once the principle of keeping them as
living resources instead of merely hunting them had been grasped, much
else was to follow - milking, for example, or the taking of eggs from
domestic poultry. Later would come the use of animals for riding,
carrying or traction.

The domestication of four animals has provided the backbone of livestock
exploitation ever since - goats, sheep, pigs and cattle. They are all
members of the mammal families of the northern hemisphere and usefully
complement one another. Goats are tough beasts, surviving on poor
pasture, and provide meat, milk, skin and wool. Sheep will live wherever
there is grass (of which there was plenty on the hills of the temperate
zone) and can be used in the same ways as goats. The first traces of someone
keeping sheep come from about 9000 bc in northern Iraq. Pigs provide
meat, will root for their food in woods and forests, grow quickly and have
large and frequent litters. Cattle produce meat, milk and hides, and can
also be used to pull and carry loads. Some of the best evidence of domesticated
animals comes from the bones of those which were eaten in early
