- Are you interviewing?<br/>- Sorry?

1353
01:28:02,271 --> 01:28:05,900
Are you interviewing for the position?

1354
01:28:06,008 --> 01:28:08,499
- Oh, yeah. Why? Are you?<br/>- Yeah.

1355
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:10,510
Mm-hmm.

1356
01:28:10,612 --> 01:28:12,705
My competition.

1357
01:28:12,814 --> 01:28:15,476
It would appear.

1358
01:28:15,584 --> 01:28:19,714
Yeah. So, a little awkward.

1359
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:21,721
Yeah.

1360
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:27,694
Well, I hope you, um, don't get the job.

1361
01:28:27,796 --> 01:28:31,323
Well, I hope you don't get the job.

1362
01:28:31,433 --> 01:28:33,333
- [Laughs]<br/>- [Laughs]

1363
01:28:33,435 --> 01:28:36,233
Have I seen you before?

1364
01:28:36,338 --> 01:28:38,306
Me? I don't think so.

1365
01:28:39,741 --> 01:28:42,141
Do you ever go to Angelus Plaza?

1366
01:28:42,244 --> 01:28:45,111
Yes. That's, like, my favorite spot in the city.

1367
01:28:45,213 --> 01:28:47,204
Yeah. Okay. Except for the parking lots, but...

1368
01:28:47,316 --> 01:28:49,216
- Yeah. L... I agree.<br/>- Yeah, yeah.

1369
01:28:49,318 --> 01:28:51,343
- I think I've seen you there.<br/>- Really?

1370
01:28:51,453 --> 01:28:54,251
- Yeah.<br/>- I haven't seen you.

1371
01:28:56,024 --> 01:28:58,652
You must not have been looking.

1372
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,728
[Narrator]<br/>If Tom had learned anything...

1373
01:29:00,829 --> 01:29:03,855
it was that you can't ascribe<br/>great cosmic significance...

1374
01:29:03,965 --> 01:29:06,024
to a simple earthly event.

1375
01:29:07,736 --> 01:29:11,695
Coincidence. That's all anything ever is.

1376
01:29:11,807 --> 01:29:13,775
Nothing more than coincidence.

1377
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:16,207
- [Man] Tom Hansen.<br/>- Yeah.

1378
01:29:16,311 --> 01:29:18,279
- Come on back.<br/>- Thank you.

1379
01:29:19,614 --> 01:29:23,573
Tom had finally learned there are no miracles.

1380
01:29:23,685 --> 01:29:26,153
There's no such thing as fate.

1381
01:29:26,254 --> 01:29:28,654
Nothing is meant to be.

1382
01:29:28,757 --> 01:29:32,318
He knew. He was sure of it now.

1383
01:29:32,427 --> 01:29:35,089
- Tom was...<br/>- Sorry. Um...

1384
01:29:35,197 --> 01:29:37,392
I just left, uh... Can l... One second.

1385
01:29:37,499 --> 01:29:40,229
[Narrator]<br/>He was pretty sure.

1386
01:29:40,335 --> 01:29:43,395
- Hey.<br/>- You again.

1387
01:29:43,505 --> 01:29:45,803
Yeah. I, uh, was just wondering...

1388
01:29:45,907 --> 01:29:49,138
if maybe after this, if, um, you...

1389
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:53,707
you want to get some coffee or something.

1390
01:29:53,815 --> 01:29:55,783
Oh, I'm sorry.

1391
01:29:55,884 --> 01:29:59,911
I'm sort of supposed to meet someone after this.

1392
01:30:00,021 --> 01:30:01,921
Okay.

1393
01:30:09,331 --> 01:30:11,231
Sure.

1394
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:13,893
- What's that?<br/>- [Laughs] Why not?

1395
01:30:14,002 --> 01:30:17,267
Okay. Well, then I'll just, uh... I'll wait for you...

1396
01:30:17,372 --> 01:30:19,499
- We... We'll figure it out.<br/>- We'll figure it out.

1397
01:30:19,608 --> 01:30:23,806
- My name's Tom.<br/>- Nice to meet you. I'm Autumn.
