199
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:12,765
[overlapping cheers]

200
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:14,645
Whoo!

201
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,045
We are taking over.

202
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,285
[cheering]

203
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:39,485
Hi, Adam.

204
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:42,725
-Good summer?
-Shut the fuck up, Tromboner.

205
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:43,885
Give me what you've got.

206
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,525
-What's in the bag?
-My lunch.

207
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:57,965
You know that, because you always eat it.

208
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,245
-I think you forgot something.
-It's just a pencil case.

209
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:11,485
Don't give a fuck about your pencil case.
Curly Wurly.

210
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:13,885
Come on, man. Not my Curly Wurly.

211
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:16,685
Give me that Curly Wurly...

212
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,045
or I will break your face.

213
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:22,205
Okay.

214
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:42,085
Aah!

215
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,205
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

216
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:46,285
Shit biscuit.

217
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:14,085
-Are you a complete moron?
-[Otis] No, I'm not.

218
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:15,445
[Maeve] That was a rhetorical question.

219
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:16,565
-Here.
-Don't touch my shit.

220
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:17,845
-Just trying to help.
-Don't.

221
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:20,125
Guys! You're not supposed to run
in the hallway.

222
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:22,525
It was my fault. Fuck off, snowflake.

223
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,045
Nice rack, Wiley.

224
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,725
[laughter]

225
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:28,765
Are you going to write me up?

226
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:30,685
I'll let you off. This time.

227
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:32,725
I'm eternally grateful for your kindness.

228
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:35,605
Actually, on second thought...

229
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,845
Head Boys notoriously peak too early.
I'd watch out, if I were you.

230
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:42,165
Oh, yeah?

231
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:44,845
[Adam] I said, nice rack, Wiley.

232
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:45,885
[laughter]

233
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:49,565
-Say that again.
-Nice... ra--

234
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,765
-[grunts]
-[groans]

235
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:55,165
You did kind of deserve that, man.

236
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:10,925
Settle down, class.

237
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:13,885
Settle down. Thank you.

238
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,205
[claps hands] Ahh!

239
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:19,485
We're jumping straight in to
the romantic world of the immortal Bard.

240
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,245
Shakespeare, obviously.

241
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:24,245
This year's first assignment
will be on As You Like It.

242
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:27,245
Set in the fictional forest of Arden.

243
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:30,125
Uh, nice of you to join us, Adam.

244
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:32,205
Uh, you'll be doing presentations

245
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:35,365
on Shakespeare's relationship
with love and disguise.

246
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:39,405
The person you are sat next to now
will be your partner for the project.

247
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,365
So if you just look at your sheets,

248
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,285
you're gonna go through
all the five points.

249
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,045
I want you to talk in pairs.

250
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,525
Please listen, right? Listening is key.

251
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:50,845
So, um, the assignment brief, um...

252
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:55,205
Examine the ways that Rosalind,
uh, tests Orlando's love for her

253
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:57,085
-in act four...
-And who are you?

254
00:13:57,165 --> 00:14:01,325
-Um... I'm Otis. Yeah.
-Act four, scene one. The impression...

255
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:04,005
-I guess we're partners for the project.
-Are you new?

256
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:06,525
No. No, no, no.
I've been here since first year.

257
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:08,685
-We had chemistry together...
-Explore the ways

258
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,845
-Shakespeare uses witty wordplay...
-...last term.

259
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:13,765
-You set my desk on fire.
-...sport and wrestling analogies...

260
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:15,805
-Anyway.
-...to reveal his characters' views

261
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:19,645
-on the subject of love.
-Maybe later on we can get together.

262
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,725
-I know the library's open...
-[chuckles]

263
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:24,045
I don't do after hours, new kid.

264
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,365
-Uh, discuss the concepts of fortune...
-Where do you live?

265
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:30,165
...and nature as they apply to Orlando
 and, um, and Oliver.

266
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,725
-43 Ashford Street.
-Compare and contrast the relationship...

267
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,845
I'll be there at 6:00.

268
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:35,245
...Orlando with Rosalind and Celia.

269
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:39,085
Um... If you have any questions,
please, uh, do ask.

270
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:42,125
But what I'd like you to do is,
really, first, just mind map.

271
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:43,805
Mind map together...

272
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:45,445
-Um--
-Boring.

273
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:47,765
What? Excuse me, this is boring?

274
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:49,485
-Okay, um...
-[bell rings]

275
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:58,605
[Eric] You told Adam where you live?

276
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:00,085
-He asked me.
-[groans]

277
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,525
Dude, your mum has a lot
of weird sex shit in the house.

278
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:05,285
I'm cool with it, obviously,

279
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:10,045
but if that guy even sees a Kama Sutra,
he will destroy your life.

280
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,325
-She won't be home.
-Oh. She better not be.

281
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:16,045
He still calls me Tromboner.
It's been four years.

282
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:17,485
Four years.

283
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:21,565
You did get an erection on the stage,
in front of the entire school.

284
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:23,005
It was a semi!

285
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:27,965
The nickname doesn't even make sense.

286
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:29,845
I play the French horn.

287
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:31,765
Such a philistine.

288
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:34,885
[Otis] Look, he'll be in my house
for an hour, tops. It will be fine.

289
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:38,845
Do you reckon his brain is so small
'cause his dick is so big?

290
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,205
-That's a myth.
-Well, it's not.

291
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,165
A friend of a friend saw it once.

292
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:46,085
She said it was the size of two Coke cans.
One on top of the other.

293
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,725
Length and width.

294
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:50,885
-You don't have any friends. Except me.
-Not for long.

295
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,005
Because Adam is going to kill you
in your own home.

296
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:56,885
[Eric laughs]

297
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,325
[grunting]

298
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:04,365
[girl] Do you really think this place
has asbestos in it?

299
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:07,365
[Maeve] I don't know.
There's worse ways to go, I suppose.

300
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:10,925
God, yeah. My auntie got eaten by wasps.

301
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:13,805
What? Was she stung to death?
[chuckles]

302
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:14,765
No.

303
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,165
She was eaten.

304
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:19,405
[gasps]

305
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:21,925
Scabby Queen. I win! I win!

306
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:24,405
No, you don't.
You have to get rid of the queen.

307
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,685
-You lost, sorry.
-I still don't get this game.

308
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:28,645
Hand them over.

309
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:31,525
Thank you.

310
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:42,845
-[Maeve] Howâ€™s it going with Knobzilla?
-He can't come.

311
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:47,085
So, the other night,
we're, like, goin' and goin'.

312
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:50,005
[American accent] And I'm losin' my shit.
[speaks normally] And I, you know...

313
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:51,925
-Reached the summit.
-Yeah.

314
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:54,125
But he, like...

315
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,525
-Slipped and dropped the yogurt?
-No, I wish.

316
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:57,845
He faked it.

317
00:16:58,365 --> 00:16:59,205
You sure?

318
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:03,085
I don't know what I'm doin' wrong.

319
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,485
[Maeve] Maybe he was nervous
or something.

320
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,765
Ruby and Olivia think I should dump him.

321
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:10,325
They say he's bringin' down
my social status, but...

322
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,165
The thing is, he can be really sweet
when nobody's watchin'.

323
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,805
[Maeve] Don't know why you listen
to those dickheads.

324
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:18,685
If you like him, do what you want.

325
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:20,845
[girl] Tits.

326
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,365
They're looking for me.

327
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,605
-Thanks for the game.
-No worries.

328
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:26,725
And the chat.

329
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:31,485
-Oh, and--
-Don't worry, you were never here.

330
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:33,885
-Ta-ra, lad.
-See you later, pet.

331
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:39,885
[girl] Hiya!

332
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,005
-Where have you been?
-Nowhere.

333
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:44,445
Biology went over.

334
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:47,125
We thought you were doin' it
with your whale dick boyfriend.

335
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,645
You know he's a delinquent, right?

336
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:54,925
Yuck. Is that ham?
We're vegan now, remember?

337
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:56,405
-Oh, right, yeah, I forgot.
-[sniffs]

338
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:57,685
Have you been smokin' again?

339
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,405
-No, I haven't.
-Good.

340
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:01,445
Because smoking is definitely not vegan.

341
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:05,845
My ham.

342
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:13,765
Have you got the money?

343
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:16,245
You taking the piss?

344
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:18,445
[boy] Take it or leave it.

345
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:20,125
[tuts]

346
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:29,685
-Tell anyone and I'll maim you.
-This better be an A.

347
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:04,645
[sighs]

348
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,565
[knock at door]

349
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:13,605
-You're on time.
-How long is this gonna take, new kid?

350
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:15,005
Well, um--

351
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:16,245
I'm already bored.

352
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:21,005
Have you got any Nesquik?

353
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:23,845
On-- Only Mana.

354
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:35,445
Do you wanna get monged?

355
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:36,805
Um...

356
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:38,845
No, thank you.

357
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:50,485
-Why is there a minge on your wall?
-What? Where? That's...

358
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,445
Uh... [clears throat]

359
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,125
That's just an orchid. [chuckles]

360
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,805
It's... My mum's super into...

361
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,445
flora and fauna.

362
00:19:56,525 --> 00:19:57,805
-[sighs]
-[lighter sparks]

363
00:19:57,885 --> 00:19:59,085
Ooh, uh...

364
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,725
Maybe not inside, sorry.

365
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:05,805
I mean, Adam, we've only been working
for half an hour, so...

366
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:06,805
Yeah.

367
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:08,365
You should keep goin'.

368
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:10,445
[sighs]

369
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:14,085
[woman] That's it,
just rolling the testicle...

370
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:16,925
-There's a ball bag on the TV.
-Good.

371
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:18,885
Sorry. Sorry, I, uh...

372
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,645
I forgot to take my... my DVD out.
It's my...

373
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:24,325
-It's my porn.
-A bit old school.

374
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:28,565
You should get on Pornhub.
There's loads of stuff on there.

375
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,005
You could watch a CGI demon fuck a horse.

376
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:34,085
-Hm.
-I need to piss.

377
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:36,925
Upstairs, on your right.

378
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:44,205
[urinating]

379
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:55,085
[zips]

380
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,805
[Adam] New kid!

381
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:10,485
Adam?

382
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:12,605
Get in here!

383
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:13,925
Oh!

384
00:22:14,005 --> 00:22:14,925
Adam!

385
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:17,005
Oh... [splutters]

386
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:20,685
-You've got a sex dungeon.
-No.

387
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:22,325
No, this is not. I...

388
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:26,005
I can explain. This is my mum's office
and she's a therapist.

389
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:27,765
-Sex therapist.
-I don't know what that is.

390
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,285
She helps people with sex problems.

391
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,125
-She's a prostitute.
-No.

392
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:35,325
-Like a pimp.
-No, no, she's like a... a shrink.

393
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:38,965
But instead of talking about mental health
stuff, she talks about sex.

394
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:40,045
People's sex lives.

395
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:42,845
She-- She helps people bone better.

396
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:45,005
Yes, in essence.

397
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:48,285
Look, um...

398
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:52,245
Could you not tell anyone
about this, please?

399
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:54,605
-[door closes]
-[Jean] Otis, darling?

400
00:22:54,685 --> 00:22:56,085
-I'm home!
-[gasps]

401
00:22:58,005 --> 00:23:00,085
[birdsong]

402
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:07,485
[chuckles]

403
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:10,125
Mm! Mmm...

404
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:12,725
[inhaling]

405
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:14,165
[exhaling]

406
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:16,925
God, that's strong stuff.

407
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,205
It is chronic shit.

408
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:23,925
-[Jean] I'm already hungry.
-[Adam chuckles]

409
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:27,445
It's snack time. [giggles]

410
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:36,805
Your mum's cool.

411
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:38,285
Why aren't you cool?

412
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,605
And she's hot.
Why didn't you say she was hot?

413
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:43,925
Because she's my mum.

414
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,965
-I mean, seriously, are you adopted?
-No.

415
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:48,845
-Then why are you so shit?
-[Jean] Adam.

416
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:49,805
Yeah?

417
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:52,765
[Jean] Do you smoke every day?

418
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:56,285
Yeah. Yeah, most days, Mrs., um...

419
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:57,685
Oh, just call me Jean.

420
00:23:58,325 --> 00:24:01,085
You know, they've been doing
some interesting studies with cannabis.

421
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:03,885
They're just starting to wake up
to its health benefits.

422
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:05,645
Yeah? Like, um...

423
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:08,405
How it makes everything funny?

424
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:10,685
-You know, like your face.
-Hm?

425
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:12,005
Ever so serious,

426
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,125
like a... atlas.

427
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:16,405
[both giggle]

428
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:26,685
However, it has been linked
to early onset impotence.

429
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:29,005
Nothing conclusive yet.

430
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,125
But be careful
with how much you smoke.

431
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:33,045
Mum...

432
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:37,285
I only bring it up
because I have a number of clients

433
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:40,125
who were heavy drug users at your age,

434
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,085
and now they have trouble
with sexual performance.

435
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:46,565
-Sexual performance?
-They have trouble finishing.

436
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:50,605
-Ejaculation.
-Hm.

437
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:52,365
Jizz, spunk.

438
00:24:53,245 --> 00:24:54,085
Man milk!

439
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:56,365
-Mum, Jesus Christ!
-Don't have a problem with that.

440
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:59,045
What makes you think
I've got a problem with that?

441
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:01,565
I didn't say you had a problem with that.

442
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:07,005
-But if you want to talk about it--
-I... Uh, okay, I'm gonna go.

443
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:08,085
I'm gonna go.

444
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:11,325
[Jean] Okay, Adam!

445
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:14,005
-Nice to meet you!
-Mum!

446
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:16,205
Come and hang out again.

447
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:19,765
Adam! Adam, wait. Wait.

448
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:22,565
You and your mum are freaks.

449
00:25:31,165 --> 00:25:33,165
I hope I didn't touch a nerve.

450
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,965
Your friend is very sensitive.

451
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:37,845
Ooh, my mouth is immensely dry.

452
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:40,045
Mum, how many times have I said

453
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:42,845
you can't go around
therapizing people you don't know?

454
00:25:42,925 --> 00:25:45,405
Your generation is so touchy.

455
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:48,485
-Information is empowering.
-No, it's fucked up!

456
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:51,565
Okay, calm down, take a breath.

457
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:54,325
Let's... [exhales slowly]

458
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:56,485
Let the negative energy dissipate.

459
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:01,645
Okay. [exhales slowly]

460
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:07,045
-[exhales]
-Two...

461
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:11,805
Sorry I yelled.

462
00:26:12,485 --> 00:26:16,365
And I'm sorry... if I upset your friend.

463
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:21,285
Come on.

464
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:26,645
[sighs]

465
00:26:27,325 --> 00:26:29,365
[sighs]

466
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:31,685
Sweetheart...

467
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:38,125
I've noticed
you're pretending to masturbate

468
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:40,845
and I was wondering
if you wanted to talk about it.

469
00:26:42,405 --> 00:26:44,245
It was the hand cream that gave it away.

470
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:47,645
And, well,
the magazine was a bit overkill.

471
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:52,565
Anyway, I want you to know that
you can talk to me about anything.

472
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:53,845
No judgment.

473
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:55,765
This is a safe place.

474
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:57,405
This is not a safe place, Mum.

475
00:26:57,485 --> 00:27:00,805
You... need to stop analyzing
everything I do.

476
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:05,885
I will when you stop creating
performative situations

477
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:07,725
that you clearly want me to observe.

478
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:09,765
[groans] Okay.

479
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:15,085
I'm going to my room, because I'm angry
and I need some space.

480
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,085
-Okay.
-[stomping]

481
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:19,165
We'll talk about it when you're ready.

482
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:20,685
[door slams]

483
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:26,125
-[rock music plays]
-[Jean] Darling! It's too loud!

486
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:31,165
[Jean] Otis!

487
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:34,125
Turn it down!

488
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:38,205
â™ª I wasn't born in '77Â â™ª

-[man] Eric, come help your mother.
-â™ª Now that we've partedÂ â™ª

495
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:57,525
Down in a minute!

496
00:27:57,605 --> 00:27:59,245
â™ª Just one soundÂ â™ª

497
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:02,725
â™ª That I just can't stand â™ª

498

â™ª OhÂ â™ª

â™ª Against my windowÂ â™ª

00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:25,125
â™ª 'Cause he's not here with me â™ª

506
00:28:26,725 --> 00:28:28,725
â™ª Hey, rain â™ª

507
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:31,925
â™ª Get off my windowÂ â™ª

508
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,365
Did you... you know?

509
00:28:35,085 --> 00:28:36,845
Yeah. I'd tell you if I didn't.

510
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,205
-Do you want me to drive you home?
-Nope.

511
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:42,165
Where do you live?

512
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:44,645
-Honestly, I'm fine.
-Come on, let me drive you home.

513
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,165
We're just fucking, Jackson.

514
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:48,245
We donâ€™t need to know
each other's postcodes.

515
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:49,605
See you at school.

[Adam sighs]

521
00:29:20,765 --> 00:29:22,445
You're five minutes past curfew.

522
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:24,445
[Adam] Sorry, Dad.

523
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:27,765
-Lost track of time.
-Don't let it happen again.

524
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:30,925
You know the rules.

525
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,485
You can have it back in the morning.

526
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,765
-[girl] Hello, lover.
-Ooh! Fuck.

527
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:54,445
How did you get in? You've gotta go.

[grunts] Your hand's a bit dry.

Can you not even get hard now?

531
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:16,725
-Am I that bad?
-Yes.

532
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:19,925
No! No, I meant no. I got confused.

533
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:22,005
I don't know why I bother.

534
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:26,725
Well-- Leave out the window.

00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:31,685
Good night, Mrs. Groff.

Good night, Headmaster Groff.

-What is wrong with you?
-[door slams]

539
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:37,925
[Mr. Groff] Adam, get down here now!

540
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:49,765
Your mum talked to Adam
about ejaculation?

541
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:51,765
-She used the words "man milk."
-Oh, my--

542
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:54,085
-It's worse than I thought.
-[sighs]

No, I mean-- I mean... It's fine.

He was baked,
he's probably forgotten all about it.

545
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,205
Shit.

546
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:02,085
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...

547
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:03,605
Don't look.

548
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:08,485
Watch where youâ€™re going, fag.

549
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:11,285
Hey, Adam, you know homophobia
is so 2008, right?

550
00:31:11,725 --> 00:31:12,805
Totes passÃ©.

551
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:20,805
Thanks, Anwar.

552
00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:22,605
-Not your friends.
-Okay.

553
00:31:24,805 --> 00:31:27,005
See? I told you he'd forget.

554
00:31:27,445 --> 00:31:28,325
Yeah...

555
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,725
[Eric laughing]

556
00:32:05,845 --> 00:32:07,245
-Yeah!
-[laughing]

557
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,285
[Otis] I'm only saying.

558
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:11,685
[Eric and Adam continue
speaking indistinctly]

559
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:31,005
Great, it's you.

560
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:33,605
I get it. You're mean.

561
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:35,765
[teacher] Okay, so...

562
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:38,085
what was gonna be biology

563
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:42,845
is now an emergency SRE class.

564
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,445
Apparently, there's been an outbreak
of pubic lice.

565
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:46,365
[laughter]

566
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:48,365
Mr. Groff felt you needed a refresher.

567
00:32:48,685 --> 00:32:50,325
Lucky me, huh?

568
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:53,365
I'm joking. This is actually gonna be
incredibly awkward.

569
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:55,085
You'll be working in pairs.

570
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:56,845
You'll need worksheets,

571
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:58,245
two prophylactics,

572
00:32:58,325 --> 00:33:00,085
and a plastic cock and balls.

573
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:01,085
[laughter]

574
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:15,365
Um...

575
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:24,725
Jesus Christ!

576
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:27,885
What's next?

577
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,845
Uh... That's not the hymen.

578
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:39,325
I think I know where the hymen is,
but thanks.

579
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:42,485
Okay, well, I mean, you're... quite wrong.

580
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:44,485
What is it, then?

581
00:33:46,605 --> 00:33:49,885
They are the paraurethral glands.

582
00:33:50,805 --> 00:33:52,645
The female prostate.

583
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:54,845
Where's the hymen, then?

584
00:33:58,805 --> 00:33:59,645
Hymen.

585
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:01,965
-Hm.
-[latex snaps]

586
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:03,485
-[screams]
-[laughter]

587
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,325
-See me after.
-[phone buzzes]

588
00:34:10,165 --> 00:34:12,845
[phones buzzing and chiming]

589
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,765
-Okay, yeah-- Phones away, please!
-[students laughing]

590
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,885
Phones away!

591
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:18,765
People!

592
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:20,365
What is it?

593
00:34:21,165 --> 00:34:22,005
Nothing.

594
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:25,045
The head of the penis
is incredibly sensitive.

595
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:28,805
Feel free to stimulate it
with your fingers in a circular motion.

596
00:34:28,885 --> 00:34:32,325
As he gets closer to orgasm,
you can speed up.

597
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:36,845
You'll feel him throbbing in your hand
like a volcano about to erupt.

598
00:34:37,245 --> 00:34:38,565
Look at that!

599
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:40,245
Huh. Here we go.

600
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:43,565
-I can feel it. Look, it's throbbing.
-Can we turn this off, please?

601
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:45,125
[Jean] Throbbing...

602
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,285
[teacher] Look...

603
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:49,165
-[jeering]
-Oh, fantastic!

604
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,165
And then he comes.

605
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:55,685
Can you go and see if he's all right?

606
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,245
Oh, fuck it.

607
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,285
Okay, thank you everyone.
That's enough drama for today.

608
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,685
[Otis whispers] Oh, my God.

609
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,165
Do you want one?

610
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:20,605
Was that really your mum?

611
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:22,565
Mm. Could have been a lot worse.

612
00:35:23,285 --> 00:35:24,965
She could have been stroking
an actual penis.

613
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:26,485
[laughs]

614
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:29,125
Oh, God. Yeah, I just think
I'm gonna die now.

615
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:31,005
Don't worry about it.

616
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:34,405
Speaking as a long-term member
of the Moordale Social Pariah Club,

617
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:35,725
you'll survive.

618
00:35:36,005 --> 00:35:36,965
[boy yelling]

619
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:42,085
[boy exclaiming]

620
00:35:42,165 --> 00:35:44,005
[gasping]

621
00:35:45,285 --> 00:35:49,125
[moaning]

622
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:51,725
Oh, ow!

623
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:54,045
[panting]

624
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,045
-[yells]
-[all scream]

625
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:57,325
Shit!

626
00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:58,925
-[Adam yelps]
-Oh, my God.

627
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:00,605
[gasps]

628
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:01,605
[laughs]

629
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:02,525
-Get out!
-Okay.

630
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:03,885
-Fine.
-No, wait!

631
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:05,685
Don't go.

632
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:07,125
Help me.

633
00:36:07,205 --> 00:36:09,445
I know it was you
who sent that video around.

634
00:36:09,885 --> 00:36:11,445
-So?
-So I'm not gonna help you.

635
00:36:11,525 --> 00:36:13,845
Please, new kid.
It feels... like it's gonna explode.

636
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:16,245
-And not in a good way.
-Well, that's not my problem.

637
00:36:16,325 --> 00:36:17,205
No, wait!

638
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:19,805
Please, don't go. [whimpers]

639
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:22,565
-Should we get the nurse?
-No! No, you can't tell anyone.

640
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:25,165
-What if he dies or something?
-Dies?

641
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:26,205
[Otis] Adam...

642
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,245
what did you take?

643
00:36:30,045 --> 00:36:31,045
Viagra.

644
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,125
How much Viagra?

645
00:36:33,845 --> 00:36:36,045
-[whimpers]
-[Otis] Hey, look, um...

646
00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:39,285
Think of this room
as being four walls of trust.

647
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,485
Anything you say is fine.
There's no judgment.

648
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:44,365
-Three Viagras.
-Jesus Christ.

649
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:46,205
-You said there'd be no judgment.
-Sorry.

650
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:49,045
Is three Viagras bad?
Her reaction made it seem like it was bad.

651
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,245
I feel lightheaded and I can taste scampi.

652
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:54,605
-No wonder. You could besiege a castle.
-I said stop staring at it!

653
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:55,965
Sorry! It's like a third leg.

654
00:36:58,565 --> 00:36:59,645
What now?

655
00:37:01,445 --> 00:37:02,325
We wait.

656
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:06,645
[sighs]

657
00:37:07,845 --> 00:37:10,405
-How is it looking?
-[Adam] Still large, still...

658
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:12,725
angry.

659
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:15,645
-Where did you even get the Viagra from?
-None of your business.

660
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:17,565
Please don't tell me you got it
from your dad.

661
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:21,445
I didn't.

662
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:25,325
Why did you take it?

663
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:28,205
I don't know.
Heard it gives you a good buzz.

664
00:37:28,285 --> 00:37:30,445
You should try it
instead of being such a joy fucker.

665
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:31,525
He's having dick problems.

666
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:34,285
-Yeah? What would you know, Wiley?
-Girls talk, clodpole.

667
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,805
Aimee said you can't come.

668
00:37:42,045 --> 00:37:43,165
It's too much pressure.

669
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:47,285
-What is?
-Everyone knows I've got a giant penis.

670
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,125
-So you wanted to make it bigger?
-No.

671
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:51,565
I just wanted it to get hard.

672
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,125
-Well, why do you think it couldn't?
-I don't know.

673
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,365
I can't stop thinkin' about stuff
when we shag.

674
00:37:57,445 --> 00:37:59,605
"What if I'm not good at this?
Maybe I'm doin' it wrong.

675
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:02,285
Maybe she knows I'm doin' it wrong.
What if my dad walks in?

676
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,765
What if my dad walks in and it's right
when I'm blowing my load

677
00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:07,085
and I can't stop,
and he sees my jizz face?

678
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:09,765
-What if..."
-Okay. Um... Yeah, no, we get it.

679
00:38:12,565 --> 00:38:13,725
[Otis] Okay.

680
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:14,805
Well...

681
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:20,285
Sounds to me like you're experiencing
some performance anxiety.

682
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:24,805
Perhaps the mythology surrounding the size
of your penis doesn't help things.

683
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,045
It is interesting you mention
your father.

684
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:29,445
How does being the headmaster's son
affect you?

685
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:31,125
Well, it's shit, obviously.

686
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:32,605
Go on.

687
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,685
Everyone's watching me all the time.
Everyone's like,

688
00:38:34,765 --> 00:38:37,045
"There goes Adam Groff,
headmaster's son.

689
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,965
He's got a big massive elephant's cock."
I've got feelings.

690
00:38:44,285 --> 00:38:45,325
I guess that...

691
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:50,285
I wish I could be a normal kid.

692
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:54,485
With a normal dick.

693
00:38:58,205 --> 00:38:59,325
And a normal dad.

694
00:39:01,845 --> 00:39:03,125
[Otis] I think...

695
00:39:03,765 --> 00:39:06,765
that you needÂ to own your narrative,

696
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,645
not let it control you.

697
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:11,005
Yes, you have a large appendage.

698
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:14,085
Yes, you're very visible in the school
due to your father's position.

699
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:16,685
But neither is likely to change.

700
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:18,365
But your outlook can.

701
00:39:19,645 --> 00:39:20,685
Does that make sense?

702
00:39:21,165 --> 00:39:22,125
Not really.

703
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:26,805
It shouldn't matter
what anyone in the school thinks.

704
00:39:26,925 --> 00:39:28,125
You are who you are.

705
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:30,205
Don't let anyone take that away from you.

706
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:32,845
So everyone's wrong, and I'm basically...

707
00:39:33,965 --> 00:39:34,805
awesome.

708
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:39,805
Be proud of your penis and your heritage.

709
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:41,845
'Cause neither are going anywhere.

710
00:39:42,285 --> 00:39:43,845
You should work with what you've got.

711
00:39:46,165 --> 00:39:48,525
[clattering]

712
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:50,805
[sighs]

713
00:39:53,485 --> 00:39:54,885
It's going down, new kid.

714
00:39:56,445 --> 00:39:57,285
Thank God.

715
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:03,485
Uh, you won't tell anyone about this,
will you?

716
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:06,165
You said that thingÂ about
the four walls of trust.

717
00:40:06,285 --> 00:40:07,445
We won't tell anyone.

718
00:40:07,725 --> 00:40:10,285
If you leave my friend Eric alone.

719
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:13,525
-For good.

It's your choice.

721
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:16,765
Fine.

722
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:19,805
I think you owe Otis an apology.

723
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:26,605
Sorry for sending the video around,
but your mum...

724
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:29,325
really got in my head, new kid.

725
00:40:30,165 --> 00:40:31,445
She's like some kind of...

726
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:33,645
sexy witch.

727
00:40:42,165 --> 00:40:43,405
Well, that was unusual.

728
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:47,645

I've had multiple parents threatening
to take their children out of school.

785
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:15,605
They were going to charge you with
public indecency if I hadn't intervened.

-Yeah.

See those two over there?

00:49:08,205 --> 00:49:11,205
The one on the right has never been
in a lesbian relationship before.

869

She's terrified
of her new girlfriend's vagina.

See her?

871
00:49:15,325 --> 00:49:18,445
She believes that flicking the bean
might make her clit drop off.

872
00:49:18,685 --> 00:49:21,565
She hates herself.
But she just can't stop wanking.

874
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:26,725
Yeah, he's definitely giving everyone
pubic lice.

What's your point?

876
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:31,805
The students at this school
need your help, Otis.

877
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:33,365
And we need their money.

878
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:36,725
I haven't really worked out the details
yet, but I'm good with numbers, so,

879
00:49:36,805 --> 00:49:39,285
I'll deal with the business end of things
and you can do the therapy.

880
00:49:39,605 --> 00:49:41,485
We'll charge for every appointment
and split the cash.

-Yeah, sex therapy.

It would be irresponsible to waste it.

He came, Otis.

885
00:49:53,045 --> 00:49:55,125

886
00:49:56,765 --> 00:49:57,845
Sort of.

887
00:50:00,285 --> 00:50:02,405
