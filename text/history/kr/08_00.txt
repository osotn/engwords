Chapter 8 - The UNIX System Interface
The UNIX operating system provides its services through a set of system calls, which are in
effect functions within the operating system that may be called by user programs. This chapter
describes how to use some of the most important system calls from C programs. If you use
UNIX, this should be directly helpful, for it is sometimes necessary to employ system calls for
maximum efficiency, or to access some facility that is not in the library. Even if you use C on a
different operating system, however, you should be able to glean insight into C programming
from studying these examples; although details vary, similar code will be found on any system.
Since the ANSI C library is in many cases modeled on UNIX facilities, this code may help your
understanding of the library as well.
This chapter is divided into three major parts: input/output, file system, and storage allocation.
The first two parts assume a modest familiarity with the external characteristics of UNIX
systems.
Chapter 7 was concerned with an input/output interface that is uniform across operating
systems. On any particular system the routines of the standard library have to be written in
terms of the facilities provided by the host system. In the next few sections we will describe the
UNIX system calls for input and output, and show how parts of the standard library can be
implemented with them.
