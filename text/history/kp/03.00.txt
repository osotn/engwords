CHAPTER 3:
USING THE SHELL

The shell - the program that interprets your requests to run programs - is
the most important program for most UNIX users; with the possible exception of
your favorite text editor, you will spend more time working with the shell than
any other program. In this chapter and in Chapter 5, we will spend a fair
amount of time on the shell's capabilities. The main point we want to make is
that you can accomplish a lot without much hard work, and certainly without
resorting to programming in a conventional language like C, if you know how
to use the shell.
We have divided our coverage of the shell into two chapters. This chapter
goes one step beyond the necessities covered in Chapter 1 to some fancier but
commonly used shell features, such as metacharacters, quoting, creating new
commands, passing arguments to them, the use of shell variables, and some
elementary control flow. These are topics you should know for your own use
of the shell. The material in Chapter 5 is heavier going - it is intended for
writing serious shell programs, ones that are bullet-proofed for use by others.
The division between the two chapters is somewhat arbitrary, of course, so
both should be read eventually.
