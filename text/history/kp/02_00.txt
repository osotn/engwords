CHAPTER 2: THE FILE SYSTEM
Everything in the UNIX system is a file. That is less of an oversimplification than you might think. When the first version of the system was being
designed, before it even had a name, the discussions focused on the structure
of a file system that would be clean and easy to use. The file system is central
to the success and convenience of the UNIX system. It is one of the best examples of the "keep it simple" philosophy, showing the power achieved by careful
implementation of a few well-chosen ideas.
To talk comfortably about commands and their interrelationships, we need
a good background in the structure and outer workings of the file system. This
chapter covers most of the details of using the file system - what files are,
how they are represented, directories and the file system hierarchy, permissions, inodes (the system's internal record of files) and device files. Because
most use of the UNIX system deals with manipulating files, there are many
commands for file investigation or rearrangement; this chapter introduces the
more commonly used ones.
