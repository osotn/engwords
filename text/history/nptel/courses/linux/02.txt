 everyone again I will come out of this
session continuing our discussion on the Linux

see the Linux basics lecture 2 before I start
the lecture I want to recap give you a little

bit of recap as what we have done in the past
lecture.

So we covered the history of Linux from UNIX
mainly it has about 50 years of history at

this point started somewhere in 1960s UNIX
the people started working on UNIX with the

mini computers then around 1991 the Linux
came into being the main person who invented

Linux - four - four walls we also looked at
why UNIX is very popular operating system

and then while in it for of the popular offering
system the main reason why UNIX is Pablo because

UNIX provides excellent security features
and it also allows multi you go multitasking

and multi city processor capabilities.
We actually saw and we define all those terms

what it means and then Linux actually provides
more features on top of that first of all

Linux is an open system. So you get the source
code along with the Linux operating system

and then we also saw how it also has very
solid they gained teachers it is globally

verified so to speak because there are so
many users using Linux and going through all

the programs all the features of Linux verifying
them everything so more than 30 years of verification

experience England.
And then it is an open platform and the companies

also use some of the commercial aspects of
it and then we also saw the main parts of

the Linux operating system the kernel the
shell and the file system we defined each

one of them as to how they interact with the
user as we saw the kernel is the lowest level

which mainly like provides the interface to
the hardware systems so it manages the resources

for the resources for being so units and then
also the memory when all those different parts

are managed the shell actually sits on top
of the tunnel and then that provides interface

power from the user to the hardware.
So in between all these things is the file

system which is essentially also defined what
the file system is how the files are structured

inside the Linux operating system and one
key thing that we notice was all the devices

are represented as files so if you want to
actually put something in the at the determinable

we simply write to a file and if you want
to read from keyboard we simply read a file

so that facilitates all kinds of interaction
much more easy compared to say even windows

operating system where you have to actually
start a process and then basically use the

process to communicate to your higher devices.
We also saw how to use the shell the what

exactly is shell is form it is essentially
am an interpreter so basically the new invoke

a shell it comes up with the prompt the prompt
could be shaped like a dollar percentage a

greater than sign in click that and each one
represents various shell and we saw a couple

of shelves like the sea shell the Bourne shell
or the bee-ash and with the Bourne-again shell

with vase or - the both official is also notice
it is called the TC shell which provides an

additional capability on top of the original
habilitation then we have got some basic introduction

to the commands.
The commands like LS is the list command we

also saw the command structure inside the
Linux operating system which is command followed

by options followed by arguments and then
we saw a couple of commands unless on CD unless

is the list command which lists all the files
in a given directory then these are like the

in boxing lessons equitable l LS x a l s-
t LS names are based options that we saw and

then also like on CD is the change directory
which allows us to go from one directory to

another and this is essentially.
When you go again it has many options and

also like arguments it needs the one argument
minimum which is well I would not say like

it in each one you can also like give it no
arguments and do you see that I mean I want

you to see what happens then you know just
a city with no arguments where is it go we

are very to take you try that experiment is
very rich it a fun extent otherwise.

You need one argument which is the destination
deduction if you do not stick to any destination

what happens so that is something that you
can do when you get to play with one will

Linux platform so I also have a couple of
activities for you based on the lecture one.

This is something that you can try talk I
am going to get a chance to play on the Linux

platform number one is you can type man we
also saw this man command with the manual

to get details about any romance so man bash
is okay with the shell see what happens whether

it is man brash and bold man PC usage these
are two shells so you can get more information

about the shell of shell a lot of options
again the shell also follows the very similar

command rules that we talked we know all about
already it is all by the options and then

the arguments for try it out see what happens.
I also ask you to do this other activity it

is you have a pile structure so you know the
slash represents the loop and then there is

a B the directory a and then under the directory
o P and C and then under root we have also

under the directive of be under that you have
directly e so I want you to write to CD commands

to go from B.
To basically one will be an absolute command

the other one is a relative will become an
means using there you are and then there you

want to go that is the relative command and
then the absolute command is this follow from

the route whatever these absolute paths so
try it out I think it is a fun exercise this

gives you some more understanding of how the
city can work so with that we will start today's

lecture I am going to cover more of the commands
themselves we will look at various commands

and the oh we can make use of them.

So I am going to start from there we left
off this is the last I just wanted to again

reinforce on goal recommend couple of things
we did not talk about some of this stuff we

talked about the tilde to represent the home
directory you can also type CD is slash home

slash which takes us to the slash home it
may not be your home directory your home may

be like slash home slash for your username
in this case let us say like the account in

here is easily so it goes there now you can
also type in like a humble home KDC a CPR

and that takes you to the next level.
And then from there like I mean we know that

the dot actually moves back one level up so
if you do a CD dot it takes us back to the

slash home and then if you do like CD dot
slash dot from the home from your a CPR then

it takes you to the root connection so you
can see like I mean how to navigate and now

go from one directed another and as I said
like the if you just do the previous exercise

that will give you like a good grounding as
to how to navigate using simple let us go

on the next command that we are going to talk
about,

Is the mkdir or in short we just say make
so make the command allows us to create new

directories and the new directories can be
created under the current directory or if

you give like an absolute part it will also
create wherever you want it to be created

so here essentially the syntax is make-do
followed by the direction so again here egg

there is a command and the directly name is
the argument you can also use certain option

for example the - P let me create the directory
three directory the three essentially like

a minute it creates this whole tree which
is the one followed by up to four.

Vedas thing meaning the one is the top level
under that you have the two and then under

that you have the and then you can also do
make the der five which is this creating a

new directory called the time and then we
say CD pound / $ so the pound dollar has a

meaning here the pound $ means the argument
the last argument of the previous command

so anytime you start with a bang it has basically
like the bang denotes so the command so we

will see some of the shortcuts until they
go even though I will I will tell some of

the structures.
As they go along but this bang followed by

the dollar the dollar denotes the last argument
from the previous owner so when we say like

CD and dollar that Bank dollar is a shortcut
or verify so then you say like city bank dollar

basically it moves from the move the cursor
from the current directly to their file because

we already created the design this is a very
useful socket I think like them in many others

form use this pretty often the other shortcut
is also like dank bang if you do the bang

that that is shortcut for the previous command.
And then you can also say like bang however

like I mean put an negative integer and that
takes you back so many nerve system for example

bang -2 is the command that got executed prior
to the previous amount so bang minus 1 is

the same as that one and then similarly that
you can go progressively behind how many our

commands without that and we will see some
more commands which allows you to get these

kind of shortcuts and then more in kind of
that navigation so the next one that we will

talk about is the user for semicolon.

Semicolon is the usually a command operator
so this allows us to actually contact Nate

multiple commands using the line so in this
one for example then say make the 5 semicolon

then CD to the 5 there is no period actually
so once you do that for example is shown here

it creates the directory and then moves the
per set to that benefit so now you can say

the prompt actually here it is actually this
very end time that is actually now in this

route slash there too so and then here also
like. I mean we already learned about this

the CD - which is essentially going back to
the previous command or previous directly.

Where it came from this is not that it is
going up on level but whichever directly that

was their biggest for example I can say like
I am in the I can gain like the route slash

select the one then already had created a
under the root there is a good the route slash

the two and then if I say like for example
CD - / root / the - under one and then if

I say CD - it actually takes me back to door
1 not 2 / 4 so this is the important distinction.

That I want you to keep in mind something
that you note notice in this particular even

bigger is shelves. On this in this particular
window with various tabs so you can actually

click and go to those thing again this is
all like the features of the multitasking

that they already know about when we learn
to the beam of nature um the all the next

command that we will learn is cat.

Is the short form for detonate or detonation
essentially like I mean when you say cat and

the argument is a filename once you give the
file name the command interpreter just open

that file and displays each line and until
the end of the line then it being puts it

back put the prompt back so this is like I
mean you cannot do any edits or anything but

if you only like displace the contents of
the file so for example like I mean there

is this text file a CPR dot text that we have
and then you say like cat a CPR it just rolls

through that all the lines and it displays
line.

Belong so VLSI design verification or verilock
system a log all this V M M and OB M and another

on so all these are displayed and then and
then even there is an empty line this side

you notice the end and then it brings back
to the prompt so this is again another useful

command to see what is inside particular so
now the question is how do we use it I mean

death by displaying a file I can through all
the lines does not seem that useful correct

but there are many ways that we can use it
for example you can copy a file into another

file and that you can use a list tap command
to do it. So how do I do it let us look at

that but here.

There is a special character another character
which is the greater than sign so when we

say like cat to a file so in this one actually
like I mean we can keep typing whatever we

type in that goes into this file called sly
one and then when we do the ctrl D it comes

back so this is one way to enter or edit a
file not really like useful in the sense that

we cannot go back and change things around
or move things around this is like this line

by line it is for input so say like I mean
if you want to type in like some notes into

just a file you can just do this cat and redirect
to a file.

And then they start typing your notes and
then it will just create it to move it is

a useful in some sense basically I mean you
can also say like an inspector at PI one and

then redirect to file - that actually lets
you copy that file so you will now have two

files PI 1 and PI 2 both same information
so this is the this is where I am actually

you are using two things one is the cat command
also the great direction operator which is

the greater than some so in this case um when
you say like one greater than time it creates

this new file and essentially Lange in right.
Into that file and if the final one is our

fly one is already there then it will not
usually right into that it will say hey this

file is there I cannot overwrite it in some
shells it also allows the writing of the content

so here actually if the final one is already
exists then it overrides identify one it is

true but sometimes some shells actually within
will not do that and then it comes back with

an arrow so it depends on like the kind of
shell movie but you can again this is one

of the features of Linux if you go customization
that people talk about so now let us see like

I mean how we can use this one so the next
slide is to give you an example of,

Where it is getting over within here we display
the mission to tap cat cortex that displays

the content this we already saw but now when
we do the cat greater than tech prepare text

and then you start typing this in such as
is not this ignition and then we do a control

D and then now when you issue the same cat
command the previous command we see actually

the file is changed and we get on with this
again try this out try various combinations

of this and I think you understand it better
that way now let us the water.

The next one which is a little bit more interesting
it is the double greater-than so it is two

arrows see here what is this actually is slightly
different than a single arrow this the two

greater than signs actually lets you to append
to a file what that means is the fly one in

the period example.

Saw that contained all these things now if
you take at two great events and then take

that word or text and then when you type in
the sector is not addressing is in control

D it will contain all these things and the
next line after this empty line will be this

one so that is the big difference between
the signature is a number two so again now

why how can you use it so here there is a
one way to use it which is sly one apply one

file to and then you are saying greater than
PI what happens into this one is actually

contact needs both these files and write it
into the fine.

Now the question is how do you append Fire
fly 1 into pile to the simple thing is like

eliminate this file thing and then you can
say at apply one double arrow by two and then

whatever the content in file two will be will
have fly1 appended to it at the end if you

want the reverse one like the pile to go to
go after the p of p 1 then you need to reverse

all click Add by to append to fly one and
then that is appended to so again another

one command to pave it I encourage you to
actually try this out and try it out multiple

times and various combinations to just understand
how this network you. So here is an example

again.

We first typed in whatever the capital text
and success is not a destination and then

followed by control D to break this man now
the next one is cat and two arrows and capital

texts and then it's a progressive journey
and then now with an tech product X we get

those two lines that they enter so this is
another way to enter a data into a file but

you know is still we are we know like now
how to create a file.

How to actually work with the file but it
is still not very clear as to how we can write

some programs and how to navigate through
a pipe we will talk about some of the commands

so later on in this course but let us go on
with this knowledge now the next one is now

we know that how to copy using the app but
Linux also supports a regular copy function.

Which is the command is CT and CP also has
again a number of options but it has few main

arguments source file and the destination
pile so if we without any options we say a

p-51 file into it copies the content of file
one into the content of file into point two

so this is another this is a very useful term
and we use this a lot of times actually in

the real life and the Linux also allows you
to actually copy many files to a destination

and you can also specify a directory here
instead of the file and then it will create

the file one exact copy of a file one and
call it also as file one under this particular

collection.
So here we can say T p- PRF again all these

things are having a meaning and then we will
see what they mean then it takes this the

files and directories and subdirectory from
this cat fur area from pepper into the HDD

backup table and it fades exactly like all
the files into them so here you see that actually

it is not the arguments of other files working
to insert they are the directors so that is

why I like I mean it is left as vaguely as
it is the source and destination.

The source could be the filename or a directory
destination could be a file name or a direction

and they are directory then you need some
options to make sure that which files are

getting puffy and even liked in source you
can use for wild cards which is something

we will learn for example the star denotes
so star you know some all the possible files

and then you can also like filter them by
specific characters and name so now let's

look at why we specify these four options
the P R and F what do they mean.

So here is a brief look into the options on
the - I is an interactive and it prompts before

over writing so if I like this symbol base
station directory and you're trying to overwrite

it will ask you hey we want to overwrite you
want happen you want to cancel this or skip

this file so then you can even use that particular
option to either copy it or to skip it or

which is one that you want to do - F is the
fourth option which is essentially does not

matter whether I like this whether it is um
it is preserved.

Whatever it is it basically forces it into
the filters remove it and then it will try

again - P is the pressure mode where all the
ownership the timestamps of all the things

are preserved and we will see like what that
means like because there is a special section

on what this file ownership what kind of things
that you can do and also like what are the

modes that you can work on a file and then
the - R is a recursive ball it is a recursive

copy which means that it goes and finds all
the sub directories and subdirectories of

the directory then it copies everything so
a copy - RF is a pores and recursive which

is one moves many times.
Dash you is the update copy only them before

styling from newer than the distance in front
or if the destination file is missing so here

essentially if you already have something
new and if you are trying to overwrite the

previous version it will prevent copying from
copy previous

Version so very useful feature so the CP - RF
is as I said local you for more than what

you can imagine in day-to-day operations.
Now if you want more details - in Harrogate

it you get more details on so there are two
is we talked about this earlier one is the

man CP by that out see what you get and also
like city - help it should give you all these

options. And what are the fifth Nag in said
short was more than the man will give you

like more details so now let us move on to
the next command.

It is MV is just call it move the more command
is different from me because more command

basically takes the pile and then moves it
over to the new distribution so in the windows

world analog is to cut and paste whereas the
CP command is more like a copy and paste so

again the arguments here are the source and
the destination and you can also rename a

file which means that the destination could
be specified as of filing rather than directly

named if you specify the direction in the
name that preserved and if this it moves over

to the new directory.
But at the same time if you specify a new

file name as a destination then it moves it
and also changes and rename a file to the

name that you wanted that you selected you
and there are many options here there is one

across and one there is mentioned this is
the - is interactive which is you see it is

trying to overwrite a new file it basically
asked you to conform so you really want to

do it or not again another nifty feature and
for getting more help on this command I want

you to type in the man move to get more.

So let us go to the next one 
the next one is the RM command R M stands

for remove so essentially let you use RM to
remove any button again you have to use it

is it extremely carefully unless you want
to do it go do it because the deletions are

permanent in then ascending so once you delete
a file it goes to the heap and essentially

dependents are lost forever the government
should use this the country is in you your

thumbs to anyway so RM by limb that is the
command and it has many options RM - I basically

interactive.
Where it pumps you before deleting a file

it asks you a we really want to delete this
file and thumbs that and then we are a minus

RF is the recursive and force as you as we
saw so it basically goes and recursively delete

all the files from sub directory the directory
is from under any of the source or the argument

that you suspect and our - our RF also does
not prompt when it tries to delete the fun

so it is really a dangerous command record
the root and then they say like Armand power

boom everything gone.
So do not try to do this and then here actually

like in like our manpower let us start the
little star here this means all the files

and in fact you can also see the starter tab
it also mean poo the same thing whether this

character or not I mean there is a file it
just is it this is the most powerful command

I will say in any of the Linux platforms so
don't ever do this one hour - adder style

if you do it from your home directory the
entire home directory is gone we do it the

root directory the root is more so I mean
there are several bishops that happen because

of you symbols our lines are a star on the
other lines are at startups. so now let us

look at the next command .

This are under again are under is used to
remove any directories so as you know garlic

Adam just the simple remove command is typically
used to remove pie even though I like that

mean if you use the Ottoman all the associated
directories can also remove but are under

specifically removes Adam tree so you are
in this example you do an LS of the home directory

and see we call these files ax I appear exact
there copy of your ATAR all those things No

that is okay.
Cat purr and you Rector one so see the color

differences right so this ovum reference is
green all these TC ragu a sporty copy and

all these things are do and then you have
red and then there are black ones so typically

the black ones are the ASCII files the red
ones here are the binary files and then you

get the blue ones which are mainly directories
and then the green one is some other type

that it cannot detect oh it basically say
it is a PDF we move on actually so it is tagged

as being so this is one of the things that
some of the shelves provide it is kind of

color it is the various files based on extensions.
So it is very easy to see that okay how many

directories are all okay I have a crossed
directory check for one is it directly x I

r Taylors a directory or VM TT is a directory
and then rebel day of inches so now I can

go and actually remove it they are in the
back for one which is this particular directive

and then if you do an LS command that particular
thing is missing and here you can also say

like the ovum TC but then it comes back with
a comma with the palm saying that a you are

trying to remove a directory which has content
in it which other which has some files in

it.
So I cannot do this so that is that this message

that they represent so if you want to do it
there are two ways of doing it on it you can

say like RM o V M TP / star and then first
remove all the files then you should wanna

go that is one way to it or the other way
in any one guess it's the RM minus RF recursively

go and remove and that also removes this particular
action so in the next actually provides the

good features to actually work on this to
for all the commands so that you don't have

this one way with multiple ways you can be
very creative in your approach so now let

us go to the next one the next command.

That we will learn is the PWD stands for present
working directory so what does that mean so

this is their prompt is it is almost saying
that this is today and what is today is there

you are right at this point of time then so
essentially the PWD venue and you say it gives

you which directory that you are currently
working on or where your prompt is so again

you are in now - home we know that actually
from first one and then you have various files

needed an LS command so one thing that you
notice is also like.

I mean before 404 this could be a machine
name currently like I am in that so it looks

for some shells also display the amount number
so if you are running the first command then

it will say 1 2 3 4 in this case it looks
like this machine after or 4 so the kappa

404 you go into the home directory you have
removed the chapter 1 lead another LS and

then the OB MTC that is this is all like the
previous commands basically there you could

remove that and then said we should be exactly
what NP I can over move now you assure the

PWD command basically it comes up with.
What where it is today that it is currently

this is the slash phone that is a - 1 here
and then it continues on so this is again

a very useful command because sometimes the
directories can be like very long like you

can be under a size because it being free
flash being size means like a it can go all

the way up to like say three and then the
prompt it only displays probably like this

V so now you want to understand what is my
present working direction.

So the PWD will give you the exactly where
you want okay so this is something like a

DTS so now PWD gives you there you are but
still you have to know where you want to go

and then based on that you can do like CD
command LS things like that form so this again

very useful command anymore so now the next
command.

That we will study is the less event so we
are already the command cat so les is very

similar to the cat comment in fact we should
start with more and then you can feel like

less but more and less are pretty much more
or less the same similar type of comments

the only difference
Between the cat and the less is unless actually

displays the file but it does not go back
to the prompt so it stays within that file

and then so it lets you go up and down the
file and the interface is similar to an editor

interface even though you cannot edit the
file.

But you can navigate inside the phone so if
I used to be then it first displays only portion

of it doesn't display the whole thing like
all the cat does basically it runs through

the thing and then it comes back the pump
instead of that the less command actually

displays the file one page at a time and then
it lets you navigate usually then go forward

by this pressing the spacebar or you can go
back by this typing be expressing be and then

need to be will go back one page there are
some other additional stuff one is the use

of slash to search within the file. So you
can say slash and then followed by a particular

string and then that is the command will search
for that particular string inside the file

to see whether it is present where it is present
inside that and then for fitting the less

you just simply type Q and then there are
additional commands inside of less this one

is the percentage for man personally it is
G which takes you to which this place.

Where what is the current percentage or the
current line how much percentage of file is

powered by the Sun at an angle there exactly
the current banks in the file the lowercase

G and I forget D actually they take you to
the first character of the file and then the

last character first line of the file in the
last name.

So uppercase G takes you to the last line
and Lotus D will take people personal so again

this is the letter command is mainly used
for inspection and you can also specify like

the condition often like - they will clear
the screen before displaying so if there is

any residual stuff and it's small file it
you will still like see from the top of the

terminal all this is done and then plus n
is there n denotes the number of line so say

like + 10 it starts printing only from the
tenth line so this is again another thing

to inspect files so you want to actually look
at a file without actually editing it touching

it.
Then the less is your command to do that again

touching is another thing then when you open
a file or reading alone you are not changing

the timestamp you do not want to say that
hey I edited the form it is only read reading

if you want to edit the file then as soon
as you edit the timestamp changes and then

this new times pan will be put in based on
when you read the file or when you started

reading by the right option also so we will
talk about some of those things in the last

section where we will talk about the file
system and how to interact the file system.

You now here is an example of less command.

So in this one it is a very top five for basically
display this in the entire screen and then

just a end so now if you if you type into
then this is this little bit you can actually

navigate using the D and magazine my ID enough
is a that I mentioned and in this file is

too small so watch but if the file goes into
multiple pages then it takes in the first

at the last after perfecting here actually
even the prompt is missing because then I

can get this big whole page and when basically
once you do the Q then it will be thing go

back to the font here it does not look that
interesting but in reality if you have a net

list for example.
You can search through the place to find a

particular component you can also search through
timing reports to understand where the maximum

delay things like that so again the less demand
has for large phone to days small program

in terms of inspection mostly okay so let
us go to the next one it is command.

Which is the head the head displays top part
of the file which is the starting point and

then you can also make it display more lines
but the default is 10 lines we use this a

like head and then behind it displays the
first 10 lines in that pipe and then the - end

essentially allows you to change the number
of lines to be shown so you can pay like - and

for then it will display the first four lines
if you can if you so the various options are

there like the here the example is head - in
50 Philo text displays the first 50 lines

of the Diagnostics ad - 18 I will name without
the n also it also works the starting line

for the power So why is this again important
the reason is the head command.

Is used in many places there you want to make
sure that the file created and more the file

has all the proper input again nice another
one is if you know that there is a splash

bar to denote a particular program and you
want to know like version from the program

itself then you can do ahead of that program
on the log file and then you know that okay.

Bits Rogan is using the other base.
Are basically to display the first 50 probably

that is where all the I use are all covered
so you know exactly with Bubo what did I use

in that I need it to run before you okay so
we will see an example of head here the Linux

context essentially display the first 10 lines
of time oh seven eight nine ten so you can

do this many people minutes and ways so now
a complementary tool head is the tail command.

We will also see this one a tail command.

And should displace 10 lines of a file but
it does not display the first line but the

last ones so the same as head command but
only thing is this displays the last 10 lines

of a file again why is this important ok we'll
see in a bit and so here also like you can

give the same options the - end in the number
or this - number this changes the number of

lines differently and there are other options
too one of the options that we always use

is the - s option the - F option actually
gives on a continuous basis the last 10 lines.

So it constantly updated it does not go back
to the prompt so why is this important or

why do you need this combo pair feature because
the tail - F and then filename it could be

a log file and then you can actually track
how the program is working and how the log

file is changing over time so now you can
say like I mean how the program is actually

progressing and then if you see anything wrong
with that you can put a stop to it you can

control C and in fact to break the tail - that
you are easy difficulty to come off of it

and the same thing.
Basically you can apply to the program itself

if you see something wrong in the running
of the program. You can put a stop it and

this is it does not change the time stamp
on the file name so if the file name is getting

written out and we were walking around the
time stamp you can you should not worry about

it if you are using a tail mindset so now
let us look at how the tail is used in the

file.

So here we specify tail - tail just a little
text and it displays the content of the critical

file with only the last 10 lines so if it
has more than 10 lines those lines are already

omitted in this example so I say as I said
earlier when we talked about the less command

the command that goes along with the less
is what is called a more.

So again as very similar to 
go like that and again it has many options

the - T clears the display before actually
clear the screen deposit explain actual display

and then - N and our display is the first
n line perform and the + n displays the lines

from that particular end and then you can
also just see the next set of lines for next

page full of lines which is passing enter
the same concept basically in the less you

we pressed the spacebar here. We press ENTER
to advance to the next page you so one use

of the more command is shown here.

So we do a LS is the list command via mobile
vault and then we know that - l a l stands

for long calm and then is it being all the
files which includes the dark patch so here

you see like the auto FSK is the dark dot
amount is the birthday you can see it also

displays these files which is missing and
you just said LS all year in LS minus L so

and then it also displays all these things
over here there are a couple of things to

note in this command on it the LS - la which
we on the inaudible in the slash which is

the root directory.
That we know about this is a special character

which is the type we call it vitamin - actually
a command and then the mode so the pipes and

T's are something that we will learn later
on these are the commands to change the command

flow itself basically so here in this one
what we are saying by using this pipe is do

the LS - la on this particular directory and
send that output to this problem and this

program is more so it displays user directories
page the page the first page has all these

elements then it will say like more so if
you press like enter then it will show the

next page usually the more command.

Exits out then it comes to the end similar
to the tab essentially whereas the less will

still be inside the pool so I think like that
is one of the probably the difference between

hormone unmoor and the less but I guess this
gives you a very good understanding about

additional commands we will take up from this
point onwards the next time around we will

go into more deeper into the Linux now that
we understood pretty much the basics it will

see what do all these characters mean.
What does this mean what does this mean then

you are out in the date time your extra group
are represented. Even like these things what

do they mean? So we will learn about those
things in the next session so again thank

you very much thank you for listening again
there is the next time I will again recap

the this particular lecture and then we will
from that point thanks for coming.
