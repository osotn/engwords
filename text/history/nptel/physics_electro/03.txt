Force Due to Distribution of Charges
In the previous class, we calculated Force on a Charge Due to a Collection of Charges and we
use principle of superposition.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:21)
In this class, we will calculate force on a charge q due to distribution of charges. By
distribution I mean it could be a charge distributed over a line, and this I will say charge per
unit length will give me the distribution that charge could be dependent on which position
and moreover it could be independent. There could also be charge say on a ring or on a disk,
here again I will say charge per unit length (=λ/length) which is usually denoted by lambda or
charge per unit area (Charge/area = σ) or charge in a volume (Charge/volume =ρ ⃗
(r) ), which
will be charge density charge per unit volume. This is known as the charge density, this is
known as surface charge density, this is linear charge density, so let us consider these cases.(Refer Slide Time: 01:45)
To start with, let us take a line charge extending from minus L by 2 to L by 2. So, that origin
it is center is at the origin, let this direction be y and I want to calculate force on a charge q
kept at a distance x from the origin. The line charge I will denote by different color, so let me
write denote it by red, this is a line charge and let this magnitude be lambda per unit length.
Then, as we did in the case of collection of charges, let me take a small element of length dy
at this point at a distance y from the origin and calculate the x and y component of the forces,
of the force on charge q. In this case, the distance from this element to the charge is going to
be square root of x square plus y square.
So, that by coulomb's law the force on charge q F vector is going to be equal to lambda d y is
the charge in this element here, q over 4 pi Epsilon 0 1 over x square plus y square in the
direction of x minus y y over x square plus y square raise to 1 half, where this vector that I
have written here, you can check is this vector and that divided by the magnitude gives me
the unit vector in that direction, this indeed is the force direction.

( x + y )
So, F x is given by the x component which is q lambda over 4 pi Epsilon 0 x d y over x
square plus y square raise to 3 by 2, 3 by 2 comes by combining these two terms and this is
integrated from minus L by 2 to L by 2, which will give me q lambda over 4 pi Epsilon 0 xwill remain there. I am left with the integral L by 2 d y over x square plus y square raised to
the power 3 by 2. You substitute y equals x tangent theta, so that dy becomes x secant square
theta d theta.

(Refer Slide Time: 04:57)
And substitute this in the integral and you are going to get F x is equal to q lambda x over 4
pi Epsilon 0 tan inverse minus L by 2 x to theta equals tan inverse L over 2 x, x secant square
theta d theta divided by x cubed secant cube theta. I am going to cancel some terms, this x
and this x cancels with this and gives me x only, this secant square theta divided by sec cube
theta gives me secant theta which becomes cosine theta on top.
And therefore, this integral becomes q lambda over 4 pi Epsilon 0 tan inverse L over 2 x with
the minus sign in front to tan inverse L over 2 x cos theta d theta and this immediately gives
you answer which is 2 q lambda over 4 pi Epsilon 0, there was this x here also. So, this x here
sin of tan inverse L over 2 x which actually becomes again I cancel this 2 with this and give
you 2 to get 2 q lambda over 2 pi Epsilon 0 1 over x sin of tan inverse L over 2 x is going to
be L divided by square root of L square plus 4 x square, that is the answer for F x.tan −1 (

How about the y component? The y component is going to be F y equals q lambda, you can
check that I am writing the expression from the previous slide 4 pi Epsilon 0 instead of x.
Because, now I will be taking a component in the y direction, so I will have minus y d y over
x square plus y square raise to 3 by 2 and this is going to be from minus L by 2 to L by 2, you
can see this is an odd integral in y and therefore, this thing vanishes.

So, on the line passing through the middle of a line charge at a distance x from it, the force on
charge q is in direction x only and it is value is F x equals q lambda over 2 pi Epsilon 0 x L
over square root of L square plus 4 x square. As L tends to infinity; that means, the line
becomes of infinite length, you can see that F x goes to q lambda over 2 pi Epsilon 0 l over x,
a well known result.F x =

(Refer Slide Time: 08:30)
Let us take example 2, for the second example I am going to take let me write example 2. I
am going to take a ring of charge, again having lambda charge per unit length and calculate
force on a charge q kept at a distance h from the ring. Now, you see each element of this line
charge is going to apply a force on this, let us take two particular elements on the opposite
sides and I am doing it for a purpose, if I look at the force due to this element, it is going to
be pointing this way.
And if I take the force due to this element is going to going to point this way, all the
distances, this distance is going to be suppose this radius is R, this distance is going to be h
square plus R square. Similarly, this distance is going to be h square plus R square, so the
magnitudes of the forces of the same and by symmetry you can see, that they are horizontal
components are going to be in the opposite directions and they are going to cancel and it is
only the vertical component that will survive.
So, what I can do is, for each element I can take the vertical component add it up, let us see
what the vertical component is going to be. So, the vertical component the force due to this
small element of length dl is going to be on charge q, due to this charge lambda dl is going to
be 4 pi Epsilon 0 force magnitude times 1 over h square plus r square. Now, I take it isvertical component, so if this let me erase this height now, now that it is clear what it is, if
this angle is theta, so is this angle.
And therefore, vertical component is going to be F cosine of theta, which by this triangle you
can see it is nothing but h divided by this distance. So, this is going to be q lambda over 4 pi
Epsilon 0 h divided by square root of h square plus r square which will give me h square plus
R square raise to 3 by 2 and there is a dl. Now, if I integrate this force that gives me the total
force, this integration all the quantities q lambda, thus all these are fixed. So, only integration
comes over dl and integration dl is really the length of the ring which is 2 pi R.

( h + R )
And therefore, the net force answer comes out to be only in the vertical direction is going to
be equal to 2 pi q lambda h R over 4 pi Epsilon 0 h square plus R square raise to 3 by 2. You
can actually see that 2 pi, R is the length times lambda, it is going to the net charge on the
ring. So, I can also write this as net charge on the ring times Q times h divided by 4 pi
Epsilon 0 h square plus R square raise to 3 by 2.

Notice, I am writing it on the left of the screen that has h tends to 0 or it becomes 0, force is 0
which makes sense, because the charge is right here, all the forces from all around pushing
are pushing the charge by equal amount. So, this is the answer. I can now use this result to
calculate force on charge q on the axis of a disc and that is going to give my example number
3.(Refer Slide Time: 12:54)
In example number 3, I am going to take this disc and put a charge at height h on the axis, I
am going to use the result of previous example. In the previous example, what we saw is that
the force on the charge is in the vertical direction, it is magnitude is given by Q q over 4 pi
epsilon 0 h over h square plus R square raise to 3 by 2. What I am going to do now is, divide
this entire disc into small rings.
So, let us take a ring of radius R, so I am taking a ring of radius R width dr and if the disc
carries charge sigma per unit area, then on this ring the charge Q is going to be or let us say
small differential charge dQ is going to be sigma times 2 pi r dr, 2 pi r dr is the area of this
ring. And therefore, the force due to this small ring or let us write differential force is going
to be d Q which is sigma times 2 pi Q over 4 pi Epsilon 0 h over h square plus now I am
going to write small r square raise to 3 by 2 and there is a r dr which is this term which I have
written out here to facilitate integration.

Epsilon 0 h integration r varies from 0 to capital R r dr over h square plus r square raise to 3
by 2, and now if I make the substitution h square plus r square equals let us say y square.

h +r = y ; rdr= ydy
(Refer Slide Time: 15:28)
So, that r d r is y d y I get the vertical force to be 2 pi sigma q over 4 pi Epsilon 0 integration
this integration is now going to be from h to square root of h square plus R square y dy over y
cubed this gives me y square and I get 2 pi sigma q over 4 pi Epsilon 0 1 over y with a minus
sign h square root of h square plus R square and that answer comes out to be, let us cut this
also two sigma q over 2 Epsilon 0 1 over h minus 1 over h square plus R square square root
and this is going to be the vertical direction.

Notice, if R tends to infinity this force goes to sigma q over 2 pi Epsilon 0, if I go to the
previous page there was not this h also which I missed. So, there is going to be 1 h out here.F=

2 π ε 0
(Refer Slide Time: 16:53)
Next page, there is going to be an h out here, let me show it by different color mistake the
mistake I made h out here, h out here. And therefore, the force becomes sigma q upon 2 pi
Epsilon 0 and that is the answer. So, I have solved three examples simple examples of forces
due to charge distribution.
