00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.550
Hello and welcome to this big history course.

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.080
My name is Esther Quaedackers and I will be
your main instructor.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.020
I will not teach this course alone though.

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.380
Some of the most prominent astronomers, physicists,
geologist, biologist, paleontologist, neuroscientist,

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.490
historians, sociologists, economist and information
scientists from the University of Amsterdam

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.780
and beyond will join me, and together we will
give you an integrated overview of all of

7
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.380
history from the Big Bang up until life as
we know it today.

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.530
But before we will start giving you such an
overview I will briefly like to reflect on

9
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.030
that task.

10
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.130
Because how do you summarize 13.8 billion
years in one brief course?

11
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:52.500
Obviously, it is impossible to describe everything.

12
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.750
That would take a lot longer than 13.8 billion
years.

13
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.160
So you have to focus on some things, while
leaving most things out.

14
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.920
And this raises a very fundamental question:
how do you decide what you focus on and what

15
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.460
you leave out?

16
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.000
There are many ways to answer this question,
and I want to encourage you to develop your

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.460
own personal answer during this course.

18
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.540
But in order to do so, it might be useful
to learn a bit more about how big historians

19
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.740
around the world are dealing with this question
first.

20
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.440
Some big historians approach big history as
a story.

21
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.700
These big historians, who are often based
in the humanities departments, focus on things

22
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.280
that intuitively feel most important, for
instance things that raise a sense of wonder,

23
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.010
are awe inspiring or thought-provoking, and
fuse these things together into a an appealing

24
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.159
narrative.

25
00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.090
The end result of this approach is a story
about our past that is in some way similar

26
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.040
to older creation stories such as Dreamtime
tales, the Mayan Popol Vuh or

27
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.040
Genesis.

28
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.840
A big history story is similar to these other
stories in a sense that it reflects the questions,

29
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.450
the fears and the dreams that are most important
to the people who create and share the story.

30
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.800
But there's also a big difference between
big history and older creation stories.

31
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.560
In contrast to these older stories, big history
is firmly based on the latest scientific and

32
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.790
scholarly ideas.

33
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.989
So even if in this approach there's quite
a lot of room for subjective and even artistic

34
00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.299
ways to compile the story, there's no room
to temper with the scientific and scholarly

35
00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.450
ideas that from the basic building blocks
of the story.

36
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.650
Other big historians, quite often those based
in science departments, use a different approach.

37
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.510
They construct big history theories.

38
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.659
They focus on the underlying patterns in big
history and on the things that might be able

39
00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:47.329
to support or refute ideas about these patterns,
much like for instance, Big Bang cosmology,

40
00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.450
plate tectonics and the theory of evolution
do.

41
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.379
Like cosmologists, geologists, and evolutionary
biologists, these bigger stories do not try

42
00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.569
to describe every star, rock or living being.

43
00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.669
Instead, they try to describe the general
mechanism that can lead to the emergence of

44
00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:10.140
large numbers and varieties of stars, rocks,
living beings, and even human societies.

45
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.129
A third approach, first developed by my colleague
Jonathan Markley and me, falls somewhere in

46
00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.389
between the big history stories and the big
history theories.

47
00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.809
It consists of writing little big histories,
in which you take a relatively small subject

48
00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:29.370
and link that to aspects of all major phases
in big history ,in order to generate some

49
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.319
new questions and ideas about the subject.

50
00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.830
This approach is bit more structured and systematic
than the big history story approach, and a

51
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.319
bit more personal and concrete than a big
history theory approach, and is therefore

52
00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:49.120
ideal for smaller research projects such as
Ph.D. projects or student assignments.

53
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.529
These three approaches will be represented
in this course in different ways.

54
00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.859
I will open all modules, except the first
and the last one, with an overview of a specific

55
00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.189
phase in big history, and I will base that
overview on what is currently the most prominent

56
00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.079
big history theory.

57
00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:10.260
Next, renowned guest lectures will build on
this overview by adding details they, our

58
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.950
university, and our society feel are most
important, and together they

59
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.849
will tell an inspiring creation story, naturally
one based on the latest scientific and scholarly

60
00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.180
ideas.

61
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.220
I will conclude all modules, again except
for the first and the last one, by providing

62
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.349
some examples of little big history connections,
and while doing so I will

63
00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.150
challenge you to do the same yourself in a
little big history assignment you will have

64
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.250
to complete in order to pass this course.

65
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.449
I will tell you a bit more about this assignment
in a subsequent video.

66
00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.970
So, during this course you will be able to
familiarize yourself with various answers

67
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.750
to the question how to summarize 13.8 billion
years in a limited amount of

68
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.090
space and time, and perhaps come up with a
new answer yourself.

69
00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.129
And as a result, while taking this big history
course, you'll not only gain a better understanding

70
00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:04.889
of how you and all the things around you have
become the way they are, but you will also

71
00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.919
learn to reflect what you think has been important
in the past, and based on that what you think

72
00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.469
is important in the presence, and what will
be important in the future.
