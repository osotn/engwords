The mass storage options for embedded devices have a great impact on the rest of
the system in terms of robustness, speed, and methods of in-field updates.
Most devices employ flash memory in some form or other. Flash memory has
become much less expensive over the past few years as storage capacities have
increased from tens of megabytes to tens of gigabytes.
In this chapter, I will begin with a detailed look at the technology behind flash
memory and how different memory organization affects the low level driver
software that has to manage it, including the Linux memory technology device
layer, MTD.
For each flash technology, there are different choices of filesystem. I will describe
those most commonly found on embedded devices and complete the survey with
a section giving a summary of choices for each type of flash.
The last sections consider techniques to make the best use of flash memory, look at
how to update devices in the field, and draw everything together into a coherent
storage strategy.
